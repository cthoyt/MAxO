Evaluation of joints by a physical therapist or orthopedist to determine need for therapies (physiotherapy, mechanical aids, orthopedic surgeries)

For LMNA-linked EDMD: evaluation of metabolic functions (glycemia, insulinemia, trigylceridemia). Rarely, an individual with LMNA-linked EDMD has had an overlapping LMNA phenotype and additional partial lipodystrophy features, thus requiring a careful metabolic assessment [Garg et al 2002, van der Kooi et al 2002].

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Baseline echocardiogram to evaluate aortic root diameter, as adjusted for age and body surface area [Campens et al 2014]. Significant aortic enlargement and/or other cardiac abnormalities should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses.

The following evaluations should not be routine, but may be appropriate in some situations:

For individuals with significant orthostatic intolerance and/or tachycardia, consider tilt-table testing to help confirm postural orthostatic tachycardia and/or neurally mediated hypotension. However, treatment of the symptoms may not differ based on the outcome, so tilt-table testing is optional. It is also sometimes appropriate to rule out adrenocortical insufficiency.

If irritable bowel syndrome is suspected, consider formal gastroenterology consultation and possible endoscopy to rule out other treatable diagnoses. Celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and other causes of malabsorption or bowel dysfunction are not associated with EDS, but may be coexisting diagnoses.

Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is appropriate at any age if height loss greater than one inch is documented or x-rays are suggestive of osteopenia. Screening DEXA in those without suggestive signs or symptoms is not currently recommended.

If a history of severe or prolonged bleeding is present, consider hematologic evaluation for von Willebrand disease, thrombocytopenia, or other bleeding diathesis. Although pathophysiologically unrelated, these conditions may coexist with hypermobility type EDS and exacerbate the hematologic manifestations.

For individuals with significant pain and/or fatigue, screen for and correction of other potential causes, including (but not limited to) vitamin D deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, folate deficiency, iron deficiency, celiac disease, or hypothyroidism.

When needed, the pain management recommendations below can be implemented by any member of the care team who feels confident enough to do so, or evaluation by a pain management specialist could be considered.

If there is suspicion of Chiari malformation, consider cerebral MRI, possibly with CSF flow studies.

Clinical genetics consultation is appropriate if there is uncertainty about the diagnosis or for assistance in evaluation and management.
Currently, no consensus exists regarding the appropriate extent of evaluation at the time of initial diagnosis.

Approach to a vascular evaluation depends on the age of the individual and the circumstances in which the diagnosis is made. Because of the risk of asymptomatic aneurysm/dissection, initial visualization of the arterial tree is commonly undertaken [Chu et al 2014]; the approach employed varies by geographic region and by institution (see Surveillance).

Because no specific gastrointestinal findings are known to precede or predict bowel rupture, there is no benefit from invasive GI evaluation.

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor is appropriate.

Establishment of an organized care team including a primary care physician, vascular surgeon, general surgeon, and a geneticist may aid in emergency preparedness. In addition, individuals with vEDS should carry documentation of their genetic diagnosis, such as a MedicAlert® or emergency letter.

Note: (1) Measurement of serum concentration of homocysteine is no longer routinely recommended since no data support a change in duration of anticoagulation or the use of vitamin supplementation in individuals with hyperhomocysteinemia and a history of VTE. In a randomized placebo-controlled trial, supplementation with folic acid, vitamin B12, and pyridoxine did not reduce the incidence of recurrent VTE [den Heijer et al 2007]. (2) There is no clinical rationale for DNA testing for MTHFR polymorphisms. (3) Although routine measurement of factor VIII levels is not recommended, testing may be useful in selected cases [Chandler et al 2002]. (4) It is still unclear whether assessment of clotting factor concentrations should be included in a thrombophilia evaluation [Chandler et al 2002].

Pharmacologic and surgical interventions have focused on palliation of symptoms.

Weighted gloves can sometimes be used to assist with dysmetria.

Symptomatic treatment is aimed primarily at the dystonia, which can be debilitating. Therapies to manage dystonia in affected individuals that have been used with varying success include the following:

Oral trihexyphenidyl, baclofen, tizanidine, benzodiazepines, and/or dantrolene

Intramuscular botulinum toxin targeting abnormal co-contraction of selected muscle groups

Ablative pallidotomy or thalamotomy. Dystonia may return despite this aggressive measure [Justesen et al 1999]. (For discussion of deep brain stimulation [DBS] see Therapies Under Investigation.)

It is important to help affected individuals to maintain independence whenever possible.

Affected individuals should be referred to appropriate community resources for financial services, services for the visually impaired (if optic atrophy is present), and special education.

As needed, individuals should be referred for adaptive aids such as a walker or wheelchair for gait abnormalities and augmentative communication devices.

Prevention of Secondary Complications

Swallowing evaluation and regular dietary assessments are indicated to assure adequate nutrition and prevent aspiration. Once the individual can no longer maintain an adequate diet orally, gastrostomy tube placement is indicated.

Surveillance

The following should be performed on a regular basis:

Monitoring of height and weight using appropriate growth curves to screen children for worsening nutritional status

Ophthalmologic assessment. Fundus photography may be helpful in characterizing changes in the optic nerve over time.

Assessment of ambulation, speech, and swallowing

Regular review of communication needs and environmental adaptations

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Therapies Under Investigation

Deep brain stimulation (DBS). To the authors’ knowledge, DBS has not yet been employed in the treatment of dystonia secondary to FAHN. Ongoing studies in the use of DBS for the management of other forms of NBIA suggest that it does provide benefit to a subset of affected individuals [Timmermann et al 2010]. Future studies will be necessary to determine whether DBS may be similarly useful for dystonia in FAHN.

Intrathecal baclofen pump. The implantable intrathecal baclofen pump has shown efficacy in ameliorating dystonia in some forms of NBIA. The intraventricular baclofen pump has been used successfully in at least one person with NBIA among a cohort of individuals with refractory dystonia [Albright & Ferson 2009]. Additional experience is necessary to better define the optimal mode of drug delivery and risk/benefit ratio.

Iron chelation. Interest in iron chelation has reemerged as trials using deferiprone have been published in other disorders of brain iron accumulation, including Friedreich ataxia [Boddaert et al 2007] and superficial siderosis [Levy & Llinas 2011]. Deferiprone can cross the blood-brain barrier and remove intracellular iron.

A single case report suggests regression of symptoms in an adult with NBIA of unknown cause [Forni et al 2008].

A recently completed phase II deferiprone trial in Italy in persons with PKAN demonstrated after six months of treatment decreased T2 hypointensity but no detectable change in clinical symptom severity [Zorzi et al 2011]. No serious treatment-related adverse events occurred.

Long-term clinical trials of deferiprone in specific forms of NBIA will be necessary to further assess safety and efficacy.

Other

Riluzole, recently recommended for cerebellar ataxia [Ristori et al 2010], has not to the authors’ knowledge undergone a therapeutic trial in FAHN.Individuals who are diagnosed with FAP or attenuated FAP should be counseled about age-appropriate recommendations for surveillance and prevention of primary manifestations, in addition to treatment of manifestations, as outlined in this section. Currently, consensus management guidelines for GAPPS are unavailable.

When clinical cognitive assessments are not informative enough, a neuropsychological assessment may be performed to provide a more comprehensive and objective view of a patient's cognitive function. Formal neuropsychological assessment requires comparison of the patient's raw score on a specific test to a large general population normative sample which is usually drawn from a population comparable to the person being examined. This allows for the patient's performance to be compared to a suitable control group, adjusted for age, gender, level of education, and/or ethnicity. While much more sensitive than bedside clinical cognitive examination, such assessment is resource intensive and time consuming.

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
See Surveillance for evaluations used to establish disease severity in an individual diagnosed with Gaucher disease (GD).

Baseline (pre-treatment) assessments may be useful in selecting treatment modality and regimen (i.e., enzyme dose and frequency of infusion).

Factors that may influence the extent of clinical testing at the time of diagnosis:

Age

Mode of ascertainment (e.g., family screening vs disease signs and symptoms)

Presence/absence of primary neurologic involvement
Most individuals diagnosed with Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS) have the craniofacial and limb anomalies only. As for all individuals with malformations, a dysmorphology examination is appropriate to exclude other anomalies.

Sophisticated imaging, especially of the CNS, is not routinely indicated unless the clinician detects findings or symptoms that specifically indicate such an evaluation.

Similarly, as most individuals with GCPS have normal development, screening beyond the standard Denver Developmental Screening test is not recommended.

Treatment of Manifestations *

The author is not aware of craniofacial reconstructive surgery being performed on individuals with GCPS as the widely spaced eyes and macrocephaly are generally not sufficiently severe to warrant surgery.

Repair of polydactyly should be undertaken on an elective basis. Preaxial polydactyly of the hands is considered to be a higher priority for surgical correction than postaxial polydactyly of the hand or any type of polydactyly of the foot because of the importance of early and proper development of the prehensile grasp.

Cutaneous syndactyly of the fingers is usually repaired if it is more than minimal.

As is true for any malformation of the feet, surgical correction must be carefully considered. Cosmetic benefits and easier fitting of shoes can be outweighed by potential orthopedic complications.

Seizures are treated symptomatically.

*As with the diagnostic criteria (see Diagnosis), no published data support these recommendations, which are those of the author.

Prevention of Secondary Complications

The only recognized preventable secondary complication may be developmental delay, which may be preventable or ameliorated by early intervention.

Surveillance *

Individuals with an OFC that is increasing faster than normal, signs of increased intracranial pressure, developmental delay, loss of milestones, or seizures should undergo appropriate CNS imaging studies to exclude hydrocephalus, other CNS abnormalities, or cerebral cavernous malformations (seen in some individuals with GCPS and large deletions [Bilguvar et al 2007; Author, unpublished observations]).

*As with the diagnostic criteria (see Diagnosis), no published data support these recommendations, which are those of the author.

Electrocardiography (ECG)

IOPD. The majority of affected infants have left ventricular hypertrophy and many have biventricular hypertrophy [van den Hout et al 2003].

LOPD. Based on findings of significant conduction abnormalities in four of 131 adults with LOPD, Sacconi et al [2014] recommended Holter monitoring at initial evaluation.

Echocardiography

IOPD. Typically echocardiography demonstrates hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with or without left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in the early phases of the disease process. In later stages, dilated cardiomyopathy may be seen.

LOPD. Echocardiographic assessment for dilatation of the ascending thoracic aorta has been recommended [El-Gharbawy et al 2011].

Pulmonary

IOPD. Most infants have varying degrees of respiratory insufficiency. Respiratory status should be established with regard to cough, presence of wheezing or labored breathing, and/or feeding difficulties. Diaphragmatic weakness caused by excessive glycogen deposits results in mild to moderate reduction of vital capacity; however, objective assessment of pulmonary functions in infants is difficult at best. Most infants display respiratory difficulty with feeds or sleep disturbance [Kravitz et al 2005].

LOPD. Affected individuals should be evaluated for cough, wheezing, dyspnea, energy level, exercise tolerance, and fatigability. Formal pulmonary function tests show pulmonary insufficiency. An attempt to assess ventilatory capacity in the supine position can detect early ventilatory insufficiency. Pulse oximetry, respiratory rate, and venous bicarbonate and/or pCO2 should be obtained to assess for alveolar hypoventilation [van der Beek et al 2011, Cupler et al 2012].

Nutrition/feeding

IOPD. Patients should be evaluated for possible feeding difficulties (e.g., facial hypotonia, macroglossia, tongue weakness, and/or poor oromotor skills) [Jones et al 2010, van Gelder et al 2012].

Assessment of growth (i.e., height, weight, head circumference), energy intake, and feeding (including video swallow study) is appropriate.

All infants should be evaluated for gastroesophageal reflux disease.

LOPD. Assessment of nutritional status as baseline is recommended. Assessment of swallowing difficulty by video swallow study may identify barriers to adequate nutrition and risk for aspiration. Gastrointestinal symptoms similar to those reported in patients with irritable bowel syndrome may be underreported in this population and may undermine quality of life.

Audiologic –

IOPD

Baseline hearing evaluation including tympanometry is appropriate. See Deafness and Hereditary Hearing Loss Overview for a discussion of age-related methods of hearing evaluation.

Sensorineural hearing loss is now documented in children with IOPD, and hearing aids may be of benefit [van Capelle et al 2010].

Disability inventory –

IOPD and LOPD

All patients should undergo assessment of motor skills and overall functioning to guide subsequent therapies and monitor progression of the disease.

Assessment of risk for falls is recommended.

Other. Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor is recommended.

To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with HFE-associated hereditary hemochromatosis (HFE-HH), the following evaluations are recommended at initial diagnosis:

Serum ferritin concentration to establish disease status and prognosis (see Figure 2)

For p.Cys282Tyr homozygotes:

Liver biopsy remains the gold standard for establishing or excluding cirrhosis.

Liver biopsy is recommended for those with serum ferritin >1,000 ng/mL or elevated AST and ALT to evaluate for advanced hepatic fibrosis [Morrison et al 2003, Bacon et al 2011].

Liver biopsy is not recommended for those with serum ferritin concentration <1,000 ng/mL and normal ALT and AST because their risk for advanced hepatic fibrosis is low [Bacon et al 2011].

MRI to estimate parenchymal iron content by utilizing the paramagnetic properties of iron:

A specialized MRI technique with excellent sensitivity for estimation of hepatic iron concentration was approved by the FDA for clinical use [St Pierre et al 2005]. This method of quantitative MRI accurately measures liver iron within a sufficiently wide liver iron concentration range. Compared with liver biopsy, MRI-R2 is noninvasive and significantly reduces biopsy sampling error [Fischer & Harmatz 2009]. In addition, T2* MRI measurement of liver iron is now widely available [Brittenham et al 2003, Cheong et al 2005, Ptaszek et al 2005].

Cardiac iron concentration can also be monitored using similar techniques and may be of prognostic value [Fischer & Harmatz 2009, Ramazzotti et al 2009].

Biomagnetic liver susceptometry (BLS) to estimate liver iron by measuring the change in magnetic flux as a hemochromatosis patient moves through a stable magnetic field, generating a voltage in the SQUID sensor [Fischer & Harmatz 2009]. As BLS is not widely available it is not included in diagnosis or management guidelines for hemochromatosis.

To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), the following evaluations are recommended [Faughnan et al 2011, McDonald et al 2011a]:

Medical history, with particular attention to epistaxis and other bleeding, anemia or polycythemia, diseases of the heart, lung and liver, and neurologic symptoms

Physical examination including inspection for telangiectases (particularly on fingers, lips, tongue, oropharynx, cheeks, or conjunctiva) and listening for abdominal bruits

Complete blood count, with particular attention to anemia or polycythemia. If anemia is present, it is important to consider other causes of anemia, particularly when the anemia appears to be disproportionate to the amount of epistaxis. People with HHT may develop medical problems unrelated to HHT (e.g., ulcers or colon cancer) that can cause GI blood loss. Polycythemia raises suspicion for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations.

Contrast echocardiography for detection of pulmonary shunting/AVM and measurement of the pulmonary artery systolic pressure as a screen for pulmonary artery hypertension. When pulmonary shunting is suggested (or if dependable contrast echocardiography is not available), CT angiography with cuts of 3 mm or less to define size and location of lesions(s) is the next step.

Head MRI (with and without gadolinium) to detect cerebral AVMs, performed as early as possible, preferably in the first year of life. Adults, including those screened with MRI in infancy, should all have a screening head MRI to detect unsuspected vascular lesions and occult cerebral abscesses.

Consideration of ultrasound or CT examination for evidence of hepatic AVM if the individual has symptoms such as high-output failure associated with hepatic vascular abnormalities or otherwise unexplained elevations in liver function tests, or if presence of a visceral AVM would confirm a diagnosis of HHT

Note: Screening for hepatic AVMs in asymptomatic individuals is not common practice because:

Hepatic AVMs are not usually symptomatic and, when they do become symptomatic, it is not sudden and catastrophic, as is seen with pulmonary AVMs and cerebral AVMs; and

Treatment options for hepatic AVMs are less satisfactory than those for pulmonary or cerebral AVMs.

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
An important subset of individuals with HCM are at increased risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD) and may benefit from an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Further evaluation to assess for the presence or absence of risk predictors associated with SCD is a standard part of patient management.

SCD risk factors include:

Personal history of ventricular fibrillation (VF), aborted/resuscitated sudden death / cardiac arrest, or sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT)

Family history of SCD

Extreme LVH (>30mm)

Hypotensive blood pressure response to exercise

Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) on ambulatory monitoring

Unexplained syncope

Risk factor information, obtained from the medical history, family history, and cardiovascular testing, includes:

Echocardiogram to measure the degree of LVH;

Exercise testing to assess blood pressure response to exercise;

Ambulatory monitoring for significant ventricular ectopy.

Accurate risk assessment is difficult because the positive predictive value of any single parameter – other than prior cardiac arrest or sustained VT – is relatively low. The presence of two or more risk factors has been associated with an increased risk for sudden cardiac death [Elliott et al 2000, Dimitrow et al 2010], although implantation of a primary prevention ICD may be appropriate in the presence of a single compelling risk factor. Conversely, the absence of any risk factors places an individual in a low-risk category [Maron et al 2003b], although 3%-5% of persons with SCD do not have a standard risk factor.

Guidelines [Garratt et al 2010, Gersh et al 2011]* recommend that implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy:

Recording of signs and symptoms of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and measurement of serum concentration of gonadotropins (i.e., FSH, LH) (pituitary gland) and testosterone (testes) or estradiol (ovaries). In several clinical situations, a dynamic evaluation of the pituitary-gonadal axis is required, consisting mainly of a GnRH (gonadotropic releasing hormone) stimulation test. Pituitary MRI may be considered in some cases.

Affected joints. Radiographic evaluation

Bone mineral density. Dual photon absorptiometry of the lumbar spine

Cardiac manifestations. ECG, transthoracic echocardiogram. In individuals without overt clinical manifestations of cardiac failure or arrhythmias, findings suggestive of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (reduced left ventricular compliance) often precede evidence of ventricular dilatation and compromised ejection fraction.

Current recommendations for HFE-associated classic hereditary hemochromatosis are that HFE p.Cys282Tyr homozygotes with serum ferritin concentration lower than 1000 ng/mL and/or normal liver function enzymes need not be biopsied. Liver biopsy should be considered for individuals with higher serum ferritin concentrations and/or raised liver function enzymes in order to establish prognosis [Morrison et al 2003]. Because of the rarity of juvenile hemochromatosis, a specific protocol for individuals with juvenile hemochromatosis is not available, but adaptation of the classic HFE-associated hereditary hemochromatosis recommendation is a reasonable approach.

As the incidence of cardiac malformations is high, echocardiogram with good visualization of the aortic arch is indicated in all individuals at the time of diagnosis. Referral to a pediatric cardiologist for management should be considered if a cardiac defect is present.

Because of the frequency of ocular findings, formal ophthalmologic examination at the time of diagnosis is recommended for all individuals with KS.

A directed evaluation of the palate at the time of diagnosis is indicated. Individuals with cleft lip, cleft palate, submucous cleft palate, or any evidence of velopharyngeal insufficiency should be referred for otorhinolaryngology evaluation.

A directed physical examination to evaluate for evidence of gastrointestinal abnormalities is indicated in neonates with KS. Evidence of cholestasis should prompt a full workup, as it would in any other child. By recognizing that eventration of the diaphragm is seen in this condition, the medical care provider can avoid further evaluation for possible phrenic nerve paralysis.

Because of the frequency of renal/urinary tract anomalies, renal ultrasound examination is indicated in all individuals with KS at the time of diagnosis. Referral to a nephrologist and/or urologist is recommended for those individuals with hydronephrosis. Referral to a urologist is indicated in those individuals with cryptorchidism.

Referral for evaluation by an orthopedic surgeon in those children with congenital dislocation of the hip(s) and other joints is recommended.

Spine radiographs at the time of diagnosis are indicated in all individuals with KS. If scoliosis is noted and/or vertebral abnormalities are detected, orthopedic evaluation should be considered.

Obtaining T cell count, T cell subsets, and serum immunoglobulin levels in all individuals with KS at the time of diagnosis or at one year of age (whichever comes second) is recommended. An evaluation by an immunologist is indicated if the levels are abnormal or if the affected individual has a history of recurrent infections.

Clinical genetics consultation is appropriate.

Caretakers should be queried regarding feeding history with particular attention to inadequate suction with breast/bottle feeding, nasal regurgitation, coughing or choking during meals, or recurrent pneumonia. If any of these findings are reported, evaluation by a clinical feeding specialist (often occupational therapist or speech pathologist) and/or videofluoroscopic swallowing study is indicated.

Hearing evaluation. An ear-specific diagnostic hearing evaluation (with either brain stem auditory evoked response or otoacoustic air emissions) in the first two months of life is recommended (see Deafness and Hereditary Hearing Loss).

After the diagnosis of dense deposit disease/membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II (DDD/MPGNII) has been made, the following evaluations are recommended:

Evaluate the complement system by measuring serum concentration of CH50, APH50, C3, C3d, C4, factor H and sMAC. (For a list of laboratories providing these tests, contact Richard Smith. See Author Notes.)

Complement protein measures in DDD/MPGNII are distinctive, with most patients having only low serum concentrations of C3, while serum concentrations of properdin, C5, and other terminal proteins are within the normal range.

Factor H serum concentrations can be low, as has been reported with pathogenic missense variants in the CFH coding sequence that block protein secretion from the endoplasmic reticulum [Ault et al 1997, Dragon-Durey et al 2004].

Measure autoantibodies including C3NeF, factor H autoantibodies (FHAA) and factor B autoantibodies (FBAA).

Flexion-extension MRI of the cervical spine when clinically indicated – for example, if cervical spine instability is suspected on plain radiographs:

Because MRI is usually performed under sedation or anesthesia, cervical spine radiographs should be obtained prior to anesthesia to evaluate for upper cervical spine instability.

In individuals with cervical spine instability suspected on plain film or those with inconclusive radiographic findings, flexion-extension cervical spine MRI can be used to evaluate for cord compression.

Flexion-extension MRI can identify dynamic changes in canal diameter leading to cord compression.

Mackenzie et al [2013] demonstrated that cervical spine flexion-extension MRI under sedation/anesthesia in children with skeletal dysplasia was safe under adequate supervision and the result was useful for surgical decision making.

Evaluation by:

A physiatrist (i.e., specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation [PM&R]) to assess mobility and autonomy. Endurance tests including six-minute walk test (6MWT) or timed 25-foot walk test (T25FW) in patients with limited ambulation have been used to evaluate functional status of the cardiovascular, pulmonary, musculoskeletal, and nervous systems. 6MWT and T25FW should be performed at the time of diagnosis.

A physical therapist to assess joint range of motion and mobility

Establishing the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD). To determine whether an individual has either classic or intermediate MSUD, it is useful to focus on concentration ratios among the BCAAs and between leucine and other essential and non-essential amino acids. Regulated concentration ratios among the full complement of circulating amino acids are one indication of in vivo residual BCKAD enzyme activity. These ratios are normally maintained within a narrow range by balanced transport of branched-chain and other essential amino acids across common carriers (LAT1/2), intracellular transamination equilibria, and coordinated activity of multiple catabolic pathways [Boado et al 1999, Matsuo et al 2000, Killian & Chikhale 2001, Umeki et al 2002, Brosnan 2003].

The following plasma concentration ratios are the most representative of amino acid regulation: leucine:isoleucine, leucine:valine, leucine:tyrosine, leucine:phenylalanine, leucine:glutamate, and leucine:alanine (mol:mol) [Strauss et al 2006, Strauss et al 2010, Mazariegos et al 2012]. In MSUD, plasma leucine concentration has the strongest reciprocal relationship to plasma alanine and glutamine concentrations (Spearman correlation coefficient -0.86 and -0.62, respectively; p<0.0001; see Figure 1) [Strauss et al 2010].

Severe BCKAD deficiency (classic MSUD) affects amino acid homeostasis at multiple levels and causes frequent and variable disturbances of plasma amino acid concentration ratios.

In milder intermediate forms of MSUD, plasma BCAAs may be chronically elevated but plasma amino acid concentration ratios tend to be preserved.

Note: (1) The majority of individuals with MSUD cared for by the authors are known to harbor a classic "Mennonite" variant in BCKDHA (c.1312T>A) and, thus, newly diagnosed children are not routinely tested for residual BCKAD enzyme activity [Strauss et al 2010]. (2) It is often difficult or impossible to establish whether or not an individual has clinically important residual BCKAD enzyme activity in vivo, even when the precise pathogenic variants are known.

Initial cardiac evaluation including at minimum:

ECG to establish a baseline record for future comparison

Holter monitoring or invasive electrophysiologic testing if the person is either symptomatic or shows significant rhythm or conduction abnormalities on routine ECG

Because of the risk of cardiomyopathy, consideration of echocardiogram and possible cardiac MRI [Spengos et al 2012]

Baseline serologic testing including fasting lipid profiles, glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin concentrations to assess for evidence of insulin insensitivity and diabetes mellitus

Measurement of serum concentrations of testosterone and FSH in post-pubertal males to assess gonadal function

Thyroid studies. While thyroid dysfunction has not been conclusively and causatively related to the DM2-causing pathogenic variants, hypothyroidism from any cause has been associated with increased muscle weakness and symptoms in individuals with DM2 [Sansone et al 2000, Day & Ranum 2005].

Measurement of the serum activities of CK, transaminases (AST and ALT), and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT). Serum activities of AST, ALT, and GGT are frequently elevated in individuals with DM2, although it is unclear whether the abnormal levels are hepatocellular or myogenic in origin. Determination of baseline abnormal transaminase and GGT activities resulting from DM2 can help prevent needless investigations of the liver.

Serum protein electrophoresis and immunoprotein electrophoresis to establish a baseline, since the gamma fraction is frequently reduced in individuals with DM2 as a result of low levels of both IgG and IgM. Although these changes have not been associated with clinical problems, determination of abnormal immunoglobulin levels in persons with DM2 can establish individual baseline values and prevent misinterpretation of future studies demonstrating the hypogammaglobulinemia.
To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with nail-patella syndrome (NPS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Blood pressure measurement and urinalysis to screen for renal disease, plus a urine albumin:creatinine ratio on a first-morning urine. The latter is a more sensitive measure of renal disease than urinalysis as it corrects for urine concentration. If any abnormalities are detected, the individual should then be referred to a nephrologist.

Screening for glaucoma as soon as a child is able to cooperate with the examination. The examination should include measurement of intraocular pressure, examination of the optic disc, and assessment of visual fields in order to detect normal pressure glaucoma. If any abnormalities are detected, individuals should be referred to an ophthalmologist. Any infant or young child found to have an abnormal or absent red reflex on eye examination by a primary care physician should be referred to an ophthalmologist immediately.

Physical examination with particular attention to the skin, skeleton, cardiovascular system, and neurologic systems

Ophthalmologic evaluation including slit lamp examination of the irides

Developmental assessment in children

Other studies as indicated on the basis of clinically apparent signs or symptoms

Clinical genetics consultation

In addition, a family history with particular attention to features of NF1 should be obtained, and physical examinations and ophthalmologic examinations (including slit lamp exams) should be performed on both parents to determine if the condition in the affected individual was inherited or occurred de novo. This determination is necessary for genetic counseling and may help identify patients who have a condition that is not caused by mutation of NF1, such as Legius syndrome or constitutive mismatch repair deficiency (see Differential Diagnosis).

The value of performing routine head MRI scanning in individuals with NF1 at the time of diagnosis is controversial.

Proponents state that such studies are useful in helping to establish the diagnosis in some individuals, in identifying any structural anomaly of the brain or skull, tumors, or vascular disease before it becomes clinically apparent in others, and in evaluating the context in which extracranial complications occur in still others.

Those who oppose routine head MRI scanning point to the uncertain clinical significance of features such as UBOs, the cost of such imaging, and the requirement for sedation in small children. Although clinical management should not be affected by the presence of intracranial lesions such as UBOs or optic nerve thickening in asymptomatic individuals with NF1, finding such lesions may result in regularly repeating the MRI for reassurance despite the continued absence of related symptoms, adding further to the cost as well as to the anxiety of the individual and family, without any benefit.

To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the following evaluations are recommended:

Renal ultrasound examination (particularly when CT or MRI of the abdomen is unavailable) can be helpful to determine the severity of disease. Ultrasound can provide an estimate of size and distribution of cysts and of overall kidney size, but CT or MRI is more sensitive and allows for better quantification of the disease severity (see following).

CT or MRI of the abdomen with and without contrast enhancement to help determine the extent of cystic disease in the kidneys and liver, as well as to estimate the prognosis. CT, but not MRI, can detect stones and parenchymal calcifications. CT or MR angiography (MRA) can be used when visualization of the renal arteries is necessary. MRI can be used when administration of iodinated contrast material is contraindicated.

Standardized blood pressure screening per the recommendations of the American Heart Association to detect early stages of hypertension. When "white coat" hypertension (i.e., blood pressure that is elevated when measured in the clinic, but normal when measured outside of the clinic) is suspected, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is appropriate.

Measurement of blood lipid concentrations because hyperlipidemia is a correctable risk factor for progressive renal disease, including ADPKD

Urine studies to detect the presence of microalbuminuria or proteinuria, which in the presence of severe renal cystic disease indicates an increased likelihood of disease progression and mandates strict control of the blood pressure

Echocardiography in persons with heart murmurs or systolic clicks possibly resulting from valvular heart disease, mitral valve prolapse, or congenital cardiac abnormalities

Echocardiography or cardiac MRI to screen persons at high risk because of a family history of thoracic aortic dissections

Head MRA or CT angiography to screen persons at high risk because of a family history of intracranial aneurysms. Note: Screening for intracranial aneurysms in individuals without a family history of intracranial aneurysms is not recommended [Irazabal et al 2011].

Serum electrolyte concentrations to identify electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hyperkalemia)

Urinalysis to assess for the urinary concentration and proteinuria. Clinical assessment of intravascular volume status for possible volume depletion or overload.

Note: White blood cells are commonly present in the urine of children with ARPKD and may not represent infection. If there is a clinical suspicion of urinary tract infection, a urine culture should be obtained before initiating treatment.

Renal ultrasonography (consider high-resolution technology when available)

Measurement of blood pressure. If elevated, home blood pressure monitoring can be helpful in distinguishing fixed hypertension from “white coat” hypertension (i.e., high blood pressure that occurs during medical examinations).

Assessment of feeding, weight gain, and linear growth with formal nutrition consultation as appropriate

Measurement of liver transaminases, serum bile acids, hepatic synthetic function (e.g., by assessing serum albumin concentration, 25-OH vitamin D levels, vitamin E levels and coagulation studies), fat-soluble vitamin levels, complete blood counts, physical examination for hepatomegaly/splenomegaly, and abdominal ultrasonography to assess the clinical extent of liver involvement

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Blood phenylalanine concentration and estimation of phenylalanine tolerance [Kayaalp et al 1997, Guldberg et al 1998]. Because the PAH genotype may not always predict phenotype (see Genotype-Phenotype Correlations), the individual's diet should be tailored to the estimated phenylalanine tolerance irrespective of genotype.

Neuropsychological investigation, including IQ, attention span, visuospatial abilities, and recall

If not performed at the time of diagnosis, ophthalmologic assessment, including visual acuity, visual field testing, fundoscopy, and optic coherence tomography (OCT) [Synofzik et al 2015]. OCT can detect thinning of the retina, loss of layered retinal architecture, and effacement of the choriocapillaris and choroidal vessels. Autofluorescence photographs and fluorescein angiography provide supplementary diagnostic information by revealing hyper- and hypofluorescent regions of abnormal retinal pigment epithelium and the choriocapillaris.

If not performed at the time of diagnosis, endocrinologic assessment for evidence of hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is detected by decreased rise of gonadotropin levels (LH, FSH) in response to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH).

For an individual diagnosed with a DICER1-related disorder, the two considerations for evaluations following initial diagnosis are:

The extent of disease spread (staging) for malignant or potentially malignant DICER1-related disorders;

The presence of other synchronous DICER1-related conditions.

Extent of Disease Spread (Staging)

Pleuropulmonary blastoma types I and IR. No metastatic potential is associated with this type; thus, the only additional evaluation is for synchronous DICER1-related disorders (see Surveillance).

Pleuropulmonary blastoma types II and III

Brain MRI to evaluate for metastatic disease

Radionuclide bone scan to evaluate for metastatic disease, followed by plain radiographs for areas of concern

PET scan for diagnosis of solid or cystic and solid tumors, response to therapy, and follow-up. Note, however, that its use has not been validated in PPB.

Echocardiography as needed to define intracardiac extension of tumor, tumor thrombi, or pericardial effusion

Rarely, spine MRI for a paraspinal or intraspinal extension

In the event of systemic embolization and any suggestion of vascular involvement (facial plethora, vena cava syndrome, cardiac murmur): investigation with vascular ultrasound examination

CT of the abdomen to assess for liver metastases

Note: Bone marrow evaluation is almost never performed, as bone marrow involvement is extremely rare.

Ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors

Intraoperative staging should be performed according to FIGO staging criteria and should include peritoneal cytology and assessment of preoperative or intraoperative rupture. Care should be taken to avoid rupturing the tumor if possible.

Spread of ovarian stromal tumors to the chest without extensive abdominopelvic disease is unlikely; however, baseline evaluation with chest CT is reasonable given the concern for synchronous conditions.

Ciliary body medulloepithelioma. Staging includes brain MRI to evaluate for direct intracranial extension and metastatic disease.

Medical genetics consultation
Because of the increased incidence of a second thrombophilic defect among symptomatic individuals with inherited thrombophilia [Emmerich et al 2001], individuals heterozygous or homozygous for the F2

20210G>A allele should be tested for other inherited and acquired thrombophilic disorders in order to evaluate the risk for thrombosis. Testing should include:

An activated protein C resistance or DNA assay for factor V Leiden;

Serologic assays for anticardiolipin antibodies and anti-beta 2 glycoprotein 1 antibodies;

Multiple phospholipid-dependent coagulation assays for a lupus inhibitor.

Note: Testing for antiphospholipid antibodies should include assays for all three antibodies (anticardiolipin antibodies, anti-beta2 glycoprotein 1 antibodies, and lupus inhibitors) since only 50% of individuals with the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome have more than one type of antibody.

Evaluation of high-risk individuals (i.e., those with a history of recurrent VTE especially at a young age, or those with strong family history of VTE at a young age), should also include assays of:

Protein C activity;

Antithrombin activity;

Protein S activity or free protein S antigen.

Note: In an evaluation for thrombophilia: (1) Measurement of plasma concentration of homocysteine is no longer recommended because no data support the use of vitamin supplementation or modification of the duration of anticoagulation in individuals with hyperhomocysteinemia and a history of VTE [den Heijer et al 2007]; (2) there is no clinical rationale for DNA testing for MTHFR variants; and (3) routine measurement of factor VIII and other clotting factor levels is not recommended; however, such testing may be useful in certain instances [Bauer 2010, Jenkins et al 2012]

To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Rb, the following evaluations are recommended:

Prior to the planning of therapy, the extent of the tumor within and outside the eye should be determined. Each affected eye is assigned a classification, depending on the extent of disease and the risk that the cancer has spread outside the eye. Extent of the tumor is estimated by clinical examination under anesthetic and ultrasound or MRI, particularly focusing on the tumor-optic nerve relationship. Head MRI is also useful to evaluate for a pinealoblastoma, indicating trilateral retinoblastoma.

For very large tumors with risk factors for extraocular disease, bone marrow aspiration and examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may also be performed at diagnosis, or performed when pathologic examination of the enucleated eye reveals optic nerve invasion or significant risks for extraocular extension.

If Rb has spread outside the eye, the stage of cancer will need to be evaluated to determine the most appropriate care of the child.

In those individuals with a family history of Rb, and in uncommon circumstances in which the child presents with strabismus or poor vision, the retinal tumors may be small and detected on clinical examination under anesthesia.

Individuals with a QTc interval >500 ms are at higher risk for an event; individuals with QTc interval >600 ms are at extremely high risk [Priori et al 2003, Goldenberg et al 2008] Overt T-wave alternans, especially when present despite proper beta-blocker therapy, is also associated with a higher risk of cardiac events [Priori et al 2013]. Individuals with a pathogenic variant who have a normal QTc interval are at low risk [Priori et al 2013].

Medical history. Individuals with syncope or cardiac arrest in the first year of life [Schwartz et al 2009, Spazzolini et al 2009] or younger than age seven years [Priori et al 2004] are at higher risk. These individuals may not be fully protected by pharmacologic treatment. Individuals with arrhythmic events while on proper pharmacologic treatment are also at higher risk [Priori et al 2013]. Asymptomatic individuals with pathogenic variants or individuals with prolonged QT intervals who have been asymptomatic at a young age (age <40 years) are at low risk for events later in life, although females remain at risk after age 40 years [Locati et al 1998].

Whether neuropsychological testing should be performed to assess the cognitive impairment frequently reported in individuals with SPG4 remains unclear. So far, no consensus exists on the type of tests that should be performed, the timing of the tests, and the purpose. Considering that cognitive impairment is often absent or is detectable only by neuropsychological testing, one should be wary of increasing the burden of individuals with SPG4, and probably only recommend further testing when required by the affected individual.

Electrophysiologic investigations may be advisable in case of pain and/or edema in the lower limbs to evaluate for associated neuropathy. Neuropathy (not a feature of SPG4 per se) may occur in individuals with SPG4 for other reasons and should be investigated and adequately treated. Because of the underlying HSP the neuropathy may remain undiagnosed if routine investigations are not conducted.

Spinal MRI examination to exclude any additional degenerative disorder can be considered if unusual symptoms or pain are present.

A thorough examination for associated restless legs syndrome (RLS) also appears to be warranted [Sperfeld et al 2007].
