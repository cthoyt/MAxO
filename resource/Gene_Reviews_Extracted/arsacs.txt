Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with ARSACS (autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay), the following evaluations are recommended: Neurologic examination Brain MRI Retinal examination EMG Clinical genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations

 Curative therapy is not available. Physical therapy and use of oral medications such as baclofen to control spasticity in the early phase of the disease may prevent tendon shortening and joint contractures. These measures may help to postpone major functional disabilities until severe muscle weakness or cerebellar ataxia occur. Urinary urgency and incontinence may be controlled with low doses of amitryptiline or oxybutynin. During school years, speech therapy and psychological support may help enhance academic performance.

Surveillance

 Surveillance should include annual neurologic examination.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Therapies Under Investigation

 Gene therapy may possibly be considered in the long term once transgenic models provide more specific clues on the molecular cascades of partially deleted or truncated sacsin and their effects on neuronal survival and functions that lead to the ARSACS phenotype. Search ClinicalTrials.gov for access to information on clinical studies for a wide range of diseases and conditions.
