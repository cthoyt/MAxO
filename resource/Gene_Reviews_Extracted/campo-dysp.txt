Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with campomelic dysplasia (CD), the following investigations are recommended: Karyotype analysis to identify abnormalities involving the SOX9 locus on 17q24.3-q25.1 and especially in phenotypic females to identify those with a 46,XY karyotype Full skeletal survey including views of the cervical spine to identify cervical vertebral abnormalities Hearing screening Medical genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations

 In children with CD and cleft palate, care by a craniofacial team and surgical closure are recommended. In individuals with a 46,XY karyotype and female genitalia, gonadectomy is recommended because of the increased risk of gonadoblastoma. (No data regarding the appropriate age for this procedure are available.)  Most survivors with CD require orthopedic care. Club feet require surgical correction. The hips should be checked for luxation. Cervical fusion surgery is sometimes needed for cervical vertebral instability resulting from vertebral malformations. Surgery is often required in childhood for progressive cervico-thoracic kyphoscoliosis that compromises lung function [Thomas et al 1997]. Bracing is usually not helpful.

Prevention of Secondary Complications

 Risk associated with use of anesthesia prior to imaging or surgery. If a cervical spine abnormality is identified, special care should be exercised for any surgical procedure.

Surveillance

 Most long-term survivors require annual monitoring of growth and spinal curvature by clinical and radiographic measurements.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk
