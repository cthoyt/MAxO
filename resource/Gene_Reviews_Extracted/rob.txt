Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with ROR2-related Robinow syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended: Orofacial assessment to determine the need for plastic surgery (presence of cleft lip and/or cleft palate ) Dental assessment for misaligned, crowded teeth Clinical and radiographic evaluation of the spine and rib cage to assess the severity of kyphoscoliosis and vertebral and rib anomalies, as these can lead to postural and respiratory complications [Wilcox et al 1997] Radiographic documentation of the forearm shortening and hand anomalies Assessment of micropenis for reconstructive surgery if due to penoscrotal transposition Endocrine investigation to explore possible: (1) gonadotropin and testosterone deficiencies amenable to treatment in males with micropenis; and (2) growth hormone deficiency Renal ultrasound examination Echocardiogram to evaluate for structural heart defects

Treatment of Manifestations

 Corrective surgeries may be required for the following: Syndactyly repair Severe scoliosis secondary to hemivertebrae and rib abnormalities Cleft lip and cleft palate repair Although it was not possible to detach the abnormal insertion of the penile crura, which can cause a normal-sized penis to be buried in the scrotum and thus appear small (see Clinical Description), Wilcox et al [1997] improved the cosmetic appearance by transposing the scrotum downward. Injection of human chorionic gonadotropin and testosterone therapy improved penile length and testicular volume in three boys with severe micropenis [Soliman et al 1998]. Hormone therapy should be monitored by a pediatric endocrinologist. Orthodontic treatment is usually required Growth hormone deficiency in children with Robinow syndrome responds to growth hormone therapy [Castells et al 1999].

Prevention of Secondary Complications

 The perioperative management of individuals with Robinow syndrome should include [MacDonald & Dearlove 1995, Lirk et al 2003, Sleesman & Tobias 2003]: Preoperative radiologic assessment of the vertebrae and ribs because of the risk for respiratory complications; Preoperative cardiac evaluation for the presence of congenital heart defects; Awareness that endotracheal intubation may be difficult as a result of the midface hypoplasia. Because growth hormone therapy can exacerbate scoliosis, progression of the spinal curve needs to be monitored during the course of therapy.

Surveillance

 The following are appropriate: Scoliosis surveillance in childhood and through adolescence, until growth is completed Surveillance of growth in childhood for evidence of growth hormone deficiency
