Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with adult polyglucosan body disease (APBD), the following evaluations are recommended: MRI of the brain and spinal column to exclude other treatable causes of gait spasticity and neurogenic bladder Assessment of post-void residual and consultation with a urologist to identify and manage complications of a neurogenic bladder Bedside or formal neuropsychometric analysis to assess for early signs of cognitive impairment Clinical genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations

 Optimally, care is provided by a team that includes specialists in physical medicine rehabilitation, urology, and behavioral neurology or psychology (i.e., behavioralists) who can provide the following: Gait safety devices including canes and wheel chairs Consideration of antispasmodic bladder medications and in-and-out bladder catheterization vs indwelling bladder catheter depending on urologic findings Behavioral modification and cognitive aids as needed

Prevention of Secondary Complications

 Gait aids and urologic management of neurogenic bladder may prevent falls and urosepsis, respectively.

Surveillance

 Periodic assessment of the following: Bladder function Gait Sensation in the distal lower extremities Cognition (e.g., executive function)

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Therapies Under Investigation

 A randomized controlled trial of trihepatnoin for APBD is ongoing. See Author Notes. Search ClinicalTrials.gov for access to information on clinical studies for a wide range of diseases and conditions.
