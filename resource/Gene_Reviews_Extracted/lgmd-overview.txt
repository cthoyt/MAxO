Management



Treatment of Manifestations

 No definitive treatments for the limb-girdle muscular dystrophies exist. Management should be tailored as much as possible to each individual and each specific LGMD type. A general approach to appropriate management can prolong survival and improve quality of life. This general approach is based on the typical progression and complications of individuals with LGMD as described by McDonald et al [1995] and Bushby [1999]. Weight control to avoid obesity Physical therapy and stretching exercises to promote mobility and prevent contractures Use of mechanical aids such as canes, walkers, orthotics, and wheelchairs as needed to help ambulation and mobility Surgical intervention as needed for orthopedic complications such as foot deformity and scoliosis Use of respiratory aids when indicated Referral to a cardiologist for standard supportive treatment of cardiomyopathy Social and emotional support and stimulation to maximize a sense of social involvement and productivity and to reduce the sense of social isolation common in these disorders [Eggers & Zatz 1998] Clinical genetics consultation

Surveillance

 The following are appropriate: Monitoring for orthopedic complications such as foot deformity and scoliosis Monitoring of respiratory function Monitoring for evidence of cardiomyopathy in those LGMD types known to have cardiac involvement

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid

 Weight should be controlled to avoid obesity.
