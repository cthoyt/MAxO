Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA), the following evaluations are recommended: Echocardiogram Musculoskeletal examination for the presence of contractures and kyphosis/scoliosis Clinical genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations

 
            Classic CCA Physical therapy for joint contractures helps increase joint mobility and ameliorate the effects of muscle hypoplasia (usually calf muscles). This type of therapy is best instituted in childhood. As affected individuals age, spontaneous improvement in camptodactyly is frequently observed. Surgical release of contractures may be necessary. The kyphoscoliosis tends to be progressive, requiring bracing and/or surgical correction. Consultation with an orthopedist is encouraged. Aortic root dilation, if present, is managed in a standard manner. Severe/lethal CCA. no general recommendations exist; findings need to be managed in a standard manner as they arise.

Surveillance

 The following are appropriate: Echocardiogram every two years until it is clear that the aorta is not involved At least annual physical examination for evidence of kyphosis/scoliosis

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 Establishing the diagnosis of CCA early in at-risk relatives may permit more careful surveillance of affected individuals (see Surveillance). See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
