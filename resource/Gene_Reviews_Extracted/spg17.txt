Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with BSCL2-related neurologic disorders, the following evaluations are recommended: Physical examination to determine extent of weakness and atrophy, pes cavus, gait stability, and deep tendon reflex  EMG with NCV  Complete family history  Molecular genetic testing Genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations

 Treatment remains symptomatic and affected individuals are often evaluated and managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes neurologists, physiatrists, orthopedic surgeons, medical geneticists, and physical and occupational therapists. Physiotherapy is appropriate. Orthopedic treatment includes orthopedic shoes and calipers (polypropylene devices that fit between the thighs and hold the legs and hips in a balanced position for standing, used in conjunction with crutches or a walker) to stabilize gait. Foot deformities are corrected by surgical treatment.

Prevention of Primary Manifestations

 Currently, no treatment for BSCL2-related neurologic disorders that reverses or slows the natural disease process exists.

Prevention of Secondary Complications

 Early regular physiotherapy can prevent contractures to a certain extent.

Surveillance

 Annual neurologic evaluation of gait, strength, muscular atrophy, and deep tendon reflexes by a neurologist is appropriate.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
