Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS), the following evaluations are recommended: Complete medical history and family history Physical examination with particular attention to skin, mucous membranes, thyroid, breasts In children: consideration of neurodevelopmental evaluation Urinalysis with cytospin Baseline thyroid ultrasound examination* (on identification of a PTEN pathogenic variant) For women age ≥30 years at diagnosis*: Breast screening (at minimum mammogram; MRI may also be incorporated) Transvaginal ultrasound or endometrial biopsy For men and women age ≥35 years at diagnosis*: colonoscopy For men and women age ≥40 years at diagnosis*: renal imaging (CT or MRI preferred) Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor * For individuals with a family history of a particular cancer type at an early age, screening may be considered five to ten years prior to the youngest diagnosis in the family.

Treatment of Manifestations

 The mucocutaneous manifestations of Cowden syndrome are rarely life threatening: If asymptomatic, observation alone is prudent. Cutaneous lesions should be excised only if malignancy is suspected or symptoms (e.g., pain, deformity, increased scarring) are significant.When symptomatic, topical agents (e.g., 5-fluorouracil), curettage, cryosurgery, or laser ablation may provide only temporary relief [Hildenbrand et al 2001]. Surgical excision is sometimes complicated by cheloid formation and recurrence (often rapid) of the lesions [Eng, unpublished data]. Treatment for the benign and malignant manifestations of PHTS is the same as for their sporadic counterparts.

Prevention of Primary Manifestations

 Some women at increased risk for breast cancer consider prophylactic mastectomy, especially if breast tissue is dense or if repeated breast biopsies have been necessary. Prophylactic mastectomy reduces the risk of breast cancer by 90% in women at high risk [Hartmann et al 1999]. Note: The recommendation of prophylactic mastectomy is a generalization for women at increased risk for breast cancer from a variety of causes, not just from PHTS. No direct evidence supports the routine use of agents such as tamoxifen or raloxifene in individuals with PHTS to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer. Physicians should discuss the limitations of the evidence and the risks and benefits of chemoprophylaxis with each individual. In addition, the clinician must discuss the increased risk of endometrial cancer associated with tamoxifen use in a population already at increased risk for endometrial cancer.

Surveillance

 The most serious consequences of PHTS relate to the increased risk of cancers including breast, thyroid, endometrial, and to a lesser extent, renal. In this regard, the most important aspect of management of any individual with a PTEN pathogenic variant is increased cancer surveillance to detect any tumors at the earliest, most treatable stages. Current suggested screening by age follows:

Cowden Syndrome

 
              Pediatric (age <18 years)
             Yearly thyroid ultrasound examination** (on identification of a PTEN pathogenic variant) Yearly skin check with physical examination 
              Adult
             Yearly thyroid ultrasound** and dermatologic evaluation Women beginning at age 30 years: Monthly breast self-examination** Yearly breast screening (at minimum mammogram); MRI may also be incorporated.** Yearly transvaginal ultrasound or endometrial biopsy** For men and women: Colonoscopy beginning at age 35 years**; frequency dependent on degree of polyposis identified Biennial renal imaging (CT or MRI preferred) beginning at age 40 years** ** For those with a family history of a particular cancer type at an early age screening may be initiated five to ten years prior to the youngest diagnosis in the family. For example, in a woman whose mother developed breast cancer at age 30 years breast surveillance may begin at age 25-30 years. Note: Although the NCCN Guidelines removed endometrial surveillance after 2007 (without expert PHTS input), it is prudent to ensure the minimal surveillance for endometrial cancer as detailed if family history is positive for endometrial cancer.

Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba Syndrome

 Screening recommendations have not been established for BRRS. Given recent molecular epidemiologic studies, however, individuals with BRRS and a germline PTEN pathogenic variant should undergo the same surveillance as individuals with CS. Individuals with BRRS should also be monitored for complications related to gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyposis, which can be more severe than in CS.

Proteus Syndrome/Proteus-Like Syndrome

 Although the observation of germline PTEN pathogenic variants in a minority of individuals who meet the clinical diagnostic criteria for Proteus syndrome and Proteus-like syndrome is relatively new, clinicians should consider instituting the CS surveillance recommendations for individuals with these disorders who have germline PTEN pathogenic variants.

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid

 Because of the propensity for rapid tissue regrowth and the propensity to form keloid tissue, it is recommended that cutaneous lesions be excised only if malignancy is suspected or symptoms (e.g., pain, deformity) are significant.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 When a PTEN pathogenic variant has been identified in a proband, testing of asymptomatic at-risk relatives can identify those who have the family-specific pathogenic variant and, therefore, have PHTS. These individuals are in need of initial evaluation and ongoing surveillance. Molecular testing is appropriate for at-risk individuals younger than age 18 years, given the possible early disease presentation in individuals with BRRS and Proteus syndrome. In individuals with PHTS, the earliest documented breast cancer and thyroid cancer are at age 17 years and before age nine years, respectively. Relatives who have not inherited the PTEN pathogenic variant found in an affected relative do not have PHTS or its associated cancer risks. See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Therapies Under Investigation

 Although mTOR inhibitors show promise for treatment of malignancies in individuals who have a germline PTEN pathogenic variant, use should be limited to clinical trials. A clinical trial specifically directed at PHTS recently concluded; results have not been published at the time of this GeneReview update. An mTOR inhibitor trial will open shortly for pediatric, adolescent, and young adult patients with germline PTEN pathogenic variants and autism spectrum disorder.
