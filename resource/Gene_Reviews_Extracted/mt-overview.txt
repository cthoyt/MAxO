Management



Treatment of Manifestations

 The management of mitochondrial disease is largely supportive [Chinnery & Turnbull 2001]. The clinician must have a thorough knowledge of the potential complications of mitochondrial disorders to prevent unnecessary morbidity and mortality. Management issues may include early diagnosis and treatment of diabetes mellitus, cardiac pacing, ptosis correction, intraocular lens replacement for cataracts, and cochlear implantation for sensorineural hearing loss. A variety of vitamins and co-factors have been used in individuals with mitochondrial disorders, although a Cochrane systematic review has shown that evidence supporting their use is lacking [Chinnery et al 2006]. Food supplements such as ubiquinone (coenzyme Q10, ubidecarenone) are generally well tolerated and some individuals report a subjective benefit on treatment. Individuals with complex I and/or complex II deficiency may benefit from oral administration of riboflavin. The role of exercise therapy in mitochondrial myopathy is currently being evaluated [Taivassalo et al 2001, Taivassalo et al 2006, Murphy et al 2008]. Coenzyme Q10 is specifically indicated in persons with defects of CoQ10 biosynthesis. Idebenone shows promise for the treatment of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. Some secondary causes of mitochondrial dysfunction, such as ethylmalonic aciduria, may have specific treatments [Tiranti et al 2009]. Those with mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) may benefit from hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Prevention Strategies Under Investigation

 The possibility of nuclear transfer as a means of preventing transmission of pathogenic mtDNA variants is currently being explored [Craven et al 2010].
