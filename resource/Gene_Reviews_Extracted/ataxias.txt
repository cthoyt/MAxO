Management



Treatment of Manifestations

 Management of ataxias is usually directed at providing assistance for coordination problems through established methods of rehabilitation medicine and occupational and physical therapy. Canes, walkers, and wheelchairs are useful for gait ataxia. Special devices are available to assist with handwriting, buttoning, and use of eating utensils. Speech therapy may benefit persons with dysarthria. Computer devices are available to assist persons with severe speech deficits.

Prevention of Primary Manifestations

 With the exception of AVED, Refsum syndrome, CTX and CoQ10 deficiency, no specific treatments exist for hereditary ataxia.
