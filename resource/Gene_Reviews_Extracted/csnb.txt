Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with X-linked congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB), the following evaluations are recommended: Ophthalmologic examination Electroretinography Family history Dark adaptation (optional) Clinical genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations

 Coincident high myopia or hyperopia can be managed with glasses or contact lenses. In some cases, conventional strabismus surgery may be required to improve binocularity or head posture.

Prevention of Secondary Complications

 Occasionally, a boy with X-linked CSNB may adopt a cosmetically unacceptable or functionally awkward head posture to dampen the degree of nystagmus in a particular position of gaze (the so-called "null point"). In some instances the position of gaze for the null point may be shifted to a better functional range by carefully planned strabismus surgery.

Surveillance

 Regular (yearly) eye examinations are recommended with refraction at a young age to monitor for the development of myopia.

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid

 Reduced visual acuity and difficulties seeing at night may preclude driving a car or restrict the class of driving license.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 For infants identified with high myopia, unusual head posture or nystagmus and a family history of CSNB, ophthalmic examination and molecular genetic testing may confirm the diagnosis of CSNB, obviating the need for neuroimaging or clinical electrophysiologic testing under sedation or general anesthesia. See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
