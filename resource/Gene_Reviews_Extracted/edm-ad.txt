Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis



To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED), the following evaluations are recommended:

Elicitation of pain history

Assessment of joint mobility

Radiographs to determine the extent and severity of joint involvement

Consultation with a medical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Treatment of Manifestations



For pain control, a combination of analgesics and physiotherapy including hydrotherapy is helpful to many affected individuals; however, pain can be difficult to control. Referral to a rheumatologist or pain specialist may be indicated.

Limitation of joint destruction and the development of osteoarthritis is a goal. Consultation with an orthopedic surgeon can determine if realignment osteotomy and/or acetabular osteotomy may be helpful in slowing the progression of symptoms.

In some individuals, total joint arthroplasty may be required if the degenerative hip changes are causing too much pain or dysfunction.

Psychosocial support addressing issues of short stature, chronic pain, disability, and employment is appropriate.

Surveillance



Evaluation by an orthopedic surgeon is recommended if the affected individual has chronic pain or limb deformities (genu varum, genu valgum).

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid



The following should be avoided:

Obesity, which increases stress on joints

Exercise that causes repetitive strain on affected joints

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk



See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
