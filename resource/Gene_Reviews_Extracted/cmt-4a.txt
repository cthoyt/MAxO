Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with a GDAP1-related hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (GDAP1-HMSN), the following evaluations are recommended: Neurologic examination to determine extent of weakness and atrophy, pes cavus, gait stability, and sensory loss Physical therapy and occupational therapy assessments regarding muscle weakness and gait and need for ankle foot orthoses, walking aids, and/or a wheelchair [Kennedy et al 2016] Speech therapy assessment if hoarseness is present or vocal cord paresis is suspected Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Treatment of Manifestations

Individuals with GDAP1-HMSN are often evaluated and managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes neurologists, physiatrists, orthopedic surgeons, and physical and occupational therapists [Corrado et al 2016, McCorquodale et al 2016]. Treatment is symptomatic and may include the following [Mathis et al [2015]: Daily heel cord stretching exercises to prevent Achilles tendon shortening. Exercise within the affected individual's capability Note: (1) Fatigue may improve with exercise; (2) unconfirmed anecdotal observations suggest benefit from the stimulant modafinil [Carter et al 2006, Ramdharry et al 2012]. Ankle/foot orthoses (AFOs) to correct foot drop and aid walking [Guillebastre et al 2011, Phillips et al 2012] Orthopedic surgery to correct severe pes cavus deformity [Boffeli & Tabatt 2015, Faldini et al 2015, Ferraro et al 2017] Forearm crutches or canes for gait stability Wheelchair for mobility because of gait instability Treatment of musculoskeletal pain with acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) [Kroenke et al 2009] Treatment of neuropathic pain with tricyclic antidepressants or drugs such as carbamazepine or gabapentin [Shy 2006, Bril et al 2011, Ribiere et al 2012, Jeong et al 2013] Weight control to avoid obesity, which has a negative effect on gait and balance Career and employment counseling because of persistent weakness of hands and/or feet Individual psychotherapy, group therapy, and/or antidepressant medication for depression [Cordeiro et al 2014] Treatment may require involvement of specialists to evaluate and manage potential complications, including the following: Lower urinary tract involvement [Krhut et al 2014] Obstructive sleep apnea and restless legs [Boentert et al 2014] Pulmonary compromise and/or phrenic nerve involvement [Aboussouan et al 2007] Vocal cord paresis Hip dysplasia [Bamford et al 2009, Novais et al 2014] Note: No special diet (including supplements with essential fatty acids, vitamin E, or creatine) has been shown to be beneficial [Mathis et al 2015].

Surveillance

Regular evaluations to determine: Neurologic status and need for treatment (or change in treatment) for musculoskeletal and/or neuropathic pain; Functional disability and need for change in physical therapy regime and/or augmentative devices for activities of daily living and mobility; Need for change in diet to control weight; Need to involve specialists to evaluate and treat potential complications.

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid

The following should be avoided: Obesity because of its negative effect on gait and balance Medications that are toxic or potentially toxic to persons with HMSN (CMT) ranging from definite high risk to negligible risk. Click here (pdf) for an up-to-date list.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic at-risk relatives in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and knowledge about agents/circumstances to avoid. See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Therapies Under Investigation

Mathis et al [2015] discuss more speculative possible future therapies for HMSN including neurotrophic factors, targeting transport defects, enhancement of autophagy-lysosomal pathways, and neuroregeneration.
