Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with microphthalmia with linear skin lesions (MLS) syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended: Ophthalmologic examination Dermatologic evaluation to look for skin lesions Brain MRI with and without contrast to evaluate for corpus callosum dysgenesis and other neurologic abnormalities Developmental assessment, with further evaluation if significant delays are identified Hearing evaluation Cardiac examination Consideration of abdominal MRI and standard protocols for management of diaphragmatic hernia Genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations

 The following are appropriate: Use of a prosthesis in severe microphthalmia and anophthalmia. In some cases ophthalmologic surgery can be considered to expand the palpebral fissures and orbit by fitting the infant with prostheses of progressively increasing size. Considerations for surgical intervention in severe microphthalmia and anophthalmia are best made after age six months, when postnatal growth of the orbit can be assessed. Regular care of a dermatologist for individuals with significant skin lesions Referral to a pediatric neurologist for evaluation and treatment if microcephaly, seizures, and/or other neurologic abnormalities are present Appropriate developmental stimulation and special education as indicated for developmental delay Routine care for diaphragmatic hernia, cardiomyopathy, congenital heart defects, and other malformations, when present

Surveillance

 Monitoring and follow up with ophthalmologist, dermatologist, pediatric neurologist, or other professionals as needed is appropriate. For those with cardiomyopathy, complete and periodic cardiac evaluation by a cardiologist experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of heart failure is needed.
