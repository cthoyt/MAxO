Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with recessive multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (EDM4/rMED), the following evaluations are recommended: Height measurement Radiographs of the entire spine (AP and lateral), pelvis (AP), and knees (AP and lateral) Clinical genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations

 Symptomatic individuals should be seen by a physical therapist and an orthopedist in order to assess the possibility of treatment (physiotherapy for muscular strengthening and maintaining mobility, cautious use of analgesic medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) and the optimal time for surgery (joint replacement), if indicated. Career counseling is recommended.

Prevention of Secondary Complications

 Intensive physiotherapy may help in delaying joint contractures and in maintaining mobility.

Surveillance

 Radiographic surveillance by an orthopedist is appropriate.

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid

 Sports involving joint overload are to be avoided.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 Presymptomatic testing of at-risk relatives is not indicated because no preventive measures or therapeutic interventions to reduce morbidity are available See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

 Women affected by EDM4/rMED may suffer from chronic joint pain which may be increased during pregnancy due to maternal weight gain. Appropriate pain management should be offered and physical therapy should be intensified.

Therapies Under Investigation

 Search ClinicalTrials.gov for access to information on clinical studies for a wide range of diseases and conditions. Note: There may not be clinical trials for this disorder.
