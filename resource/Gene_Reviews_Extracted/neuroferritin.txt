Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with neuroferritinopathy, the following evaluations are recommended: Psychometric assessment Physiotherapy assessment Speech therapy assessment Dietary assessment

Treatment of Manifestations

The movement disorder is particularly resistant to conventional therapy, but some response has been recorded with levodopa, tetrabenazine, orphenadrine, benzhexol, sulpiride, diazepam, clonazepam, and deanol in standard doses [Chinnery et al 2007, Ondo et al 2010] Botulinum toxin is helpful for painful focal dystonia.

Prevention of Secondary Complications

Dietary assessment is helpful; affected individuals should maintain caloric intake. Physiotherapy helps to maintain mobility and prevent contractures.

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid

Iron supplements are not recommended for affected individuals and those at risk. This recommendation is empiric [Chinnery et al 2007] Iron replacement therapy with careful monitoring may be required if affected individuals develop coincidental iron deficiency anemia.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Therapies Under Investigation

Current treatments under evaluation: Venesection Iron chelation with deferiprone Coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone); the therapeutic role is being evaluated based on evidence of mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction in neuroferritinopathy [Caparros-Lefebvre et al 1997, Chinnery et al 2003].
