At-risk sibs should be tested either prenatally or in the newborn period as they will benefit from early intervention (see Treatment of Manifestations). Molecular genetic testing is possible if both pathogenic variants have been identified in the family.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
The sibs of a proband should be evaluated as soon as possible after birth to determine if they have HbH disease so that appropriate monitoring can be instituted. Evaluations can include:

Evaluation of red blood cell indices, red blood cell supravital stain for HbH inclusions and hemoglobin analysis by HPLC

Targeted molecular analysis if the pathogenic variants in the family are known

Molecular genetic analysis (according to the frequency of α-globin gene pathogenic variants in each geographic area) if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

During pregnancy several complications have been reported in women with HbH disease, including worsening of anemia (with occasional need of red cell transfusions), preeclampsia, congestive heart failure, and threatened miscarriage [Origa et al 2007]. Monitoring for these possible complications is recommended.
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures. Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known;

Urinary steroid profiling using gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GC/MS) can be done if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known. The characteristic urinary steroid profile:

Increased coancentration of metabolites of pregnenolone (pregnenediol) and progesterone (pregnanediol)

Significantly elevated metabolites associated with:

Deficiency of 17α-hydroxylase (5 α-tetrahydrocorticosterone, tetrahydrocorticosterone, and 11 dehydrometabolites)

Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase (17 α-hydroxypregnanolone, pregnanetriol, and pregnanetriolone)

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Fertility may be a concern. No reports describe reproduction in individuals with PORD; thus, the prevalence of infertility among individuals with PORD remains uncertain.

Hepatic drug metabolism. NADPH--cytochrome P450 reductase (POR) plays an important role in the metabolism of various drugs and endogenous metabolites/hormones by hepatic microsomal (type 2) P450 cytochromes. Initial studies using bacterially expressed POR pathogenic variants and two hepatic P450 enzymes suggest that pathogenic variants in POR may alter drug metabolism [Miller et al 2009]. In these studies different pathogenic variants resulted in different effects, ranging from no apparent activity to elevated activity of the hepatic P450 enzymes; these activities were not correlated with their activity in CYP17A1 assays.

In vitro activity assays on major drug-metabolizing enzymes and in vivo investigations to assess the impact of various pathogenic and non-pathogenic variants of POR have been performed by various groups [Agrawal et al 2008, Hart & Zhong 2008, Kranendonk et al 2008, Gomes et al 2009, Oneda et al 2009, Agrawal et al 2010, Flück et al 2010, Tomalik-Scharte et al 2010]. For comprehensive reviews on the pharmacogenetics of POR see Pandey & Sproll [2014] and Burkhard et al [2017].

In brief, the different pathogenic variations have different effects on microsomal P450 drug metabolizing enzymes. The common pathogenic variant p.Ala287Pro reduces the activity of the major P450 cytochrome CYP3A4 (which metabolizes ~50% of clinically used drugs) by more than 75% [Nicolo et al 2010]. In vivo cocktail phenotyping in an individual homozygous for the p.Ala287Pro pathogenic variant confirmed altered hepatic detoxification of a variety of drugs due to impaired activity of various hepatic CYP enzymes, including CYP3A4, CYP1A1, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6; the heterozygous mother of this individual also showed impaired activities of CYP1A1 and CYP2C9 [Tomalik-Scharte et al 2010]. In addition, in vitro assays suggest that some variants cause a substrate-specific modulation of CYP3A4 [Agrawal et al 2010].See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Cephalo-pelvic disproportion may necessitate delivery by caesarean section when the pregnant woman is of average stature and the fetus has achondroplasia.

Pregnant women with achondroplasia must always be delivered by caesarean section because of the small size of the pelvis.
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of a proband (starting at age 15 years) in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from surveillance and initiation of treatment. However, the proper preventive approach for asymptomatic sibs is unknown:

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known;

Monitoring of serum concentrations of hemoglobin and hemoglobin A1c as anemia and diabetes may precede neurologic symptoms (see also Surveillance).

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures:

If the pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, detailed neurologic and cardiologic evaluation, 12-lead ECG, and 24-hour Holter monitoring can be used to clarify the disease status of at-risk relatives.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

The rarity of ATS and the paucity of reports pertaining to pregnancy in women with ATS make an evidence-based approach to pregnancy management difficult to formulate. One case study reported an uneventful pregnancy, with increased episodes of weakness but reduced ventricular ectopy compared to the pre-pregnancy period [Subbiah et al 2008]. However, as data are limited, a multidisciplinary approach to individual care and anticipation of increased risk (as can be seen in those with long QT syndrome) seems reasonable.
Using molecular genetic testing for the ACTG2 pathogenic variant identified in an affected family member, it is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk as early diagnosis may help prevent unnecessary surgery for symptoms of intestinal obstruction and may allow early evaluation of bladder and renal function, and the urinary tract for evidence of dilation.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

When a fetus at risk for an ACTG2-related disorder has evidence of bladder distention on prenatal ultrasound examination, consultation with a maternal fetal medicine specialist is recommended. Of note, in some fetuses with prenatal detection of megacystis, vesicoamniotic shunts have been performed. The rationale for this has been questioned [Tuzovic et al 2014].

Among the limited number of mothers with an ACTG2-related disorder reported, some instances of poor labor progression and weak uterine contractions have been noted [Klar et al 2015].
It is appropriate to evaluate newborn sibs of a proband so that morbidity and mortality can be reduced by early diagnosis and treatment. Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known;

Assay of ADA catalytic activity if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and/or surveillance for cardiovascular and/or neurologic manifestations.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known;

Examination by a clinical geneticist if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Sibs of a proband with an ADAMTSL4-related eye disorder should undergo complete ophthalmologic evaluation (determination of visual acuity, measurement of intraocular pressure, slit lamp examination, and ophthalmoscopy) to allow early diagnosis and treatment of findings, primarily to prevent amblyopia.

If the pathogenic variants in a family are known, molecular genetic testing is likely to be more helpful that clinical examination in clarifying the genetic status of at-risk sibs, given the wide phenotypic variability even within the same family.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Potential teratogenic effects of medications given for treatment of ADCY5-related dyskinesia should be discussed with affected women of childbearing age, ideally prior to conception.
It is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, a medical history to seek evidence of affected status should be elicited from relatives at risk.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic at-risk relatives of an affected individual by molecular genetic testing of the TP63 pathogenic variant in the family in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

If the genetic status of an at-risk male relative has not been established during pregnancy, genetic testing should be performed as soon as possible after birth to clarify genetic status so that glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid hormone replacement therapy can be initiated without delay and adrenal crises can be avoided. Biochemical testing after birth should be undertaken if the genetic status of an at-risk male is unknown and the child should be closely monitored in the first few days of life. A salt-losing crisis usually takes at least seven days to manifest, during which the child is continuing to lose sodium. Initial biochemical tests of electrolytes and basal cortisol may be within normal ranges but may gradually change. The aim is to avoid a clinical salt-losing crisis.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to genetic counseling of relatives at risk.
If the HMBS pathogenic variant is known in a family, at-risk relatives can benefit from molecular genetic testing to clarify their genetic status, so that those at increased risk of developing acute attacks of AIP can be identified early and counseled about preventive measures.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

The majority of women with AIP have completely normal pregnancies with no clinical problems relating to the porphyria [Marsden & Rees 2010]. However, there is a small chance that pregnancy could initiate or worsen porphyria symptoms.

When a woman with AIP experiences abdominal pain, hypertension, and tachycardia during pregnancy, complications of pregnancy should be excluded before the findings are attributed to an acute attack.

Symptomatic treatment of an acute attack that occurs during pregnancy should take into account drug safety with respect to teratogenicity and precipitating/exacerbating an acute attack of porphyria.

Intravenous human hemin (both available preparations) has been used for the treatment of acute attacks in pregnancy and appears to be safe [Anderson et al 2005, Marsden & Rees 2010]. Several women in the UK and France have received regular heme arginate infusions during pregnancy without any obvious adverse effects on mother or child [Badminton & Deybach 2006].

Prolonged fasting should be avoided during labor and delivery as should the use of unsafe drugs, for example, ergometrine.

Note: In an obstetric emergency, no drug should be restricted if it is likely to be of major clinical benefit or is required in a life-threatening situation.

Stress should be minimized by providing good analgesia. Regional anesthesia, in the form of spinal or epidural anesthesia using bupivacaine, has been safely used.
Given the medical problems of this condition and their variability, it is appropriate to assess first-degree relatives for manifestations of the disorder.

If a JAG1 or NOTCH2 pathogenic variant has been identified in a proband, at-risk relatives can be evaluated using genetic testing.

If no JAG1 or NOTCH2 pathogenic variant has been identified, at-risk relatives can be assessed with measurement of liver enzymes, cardiac examination, eye examination, skeletal x-rays, and evaluation of facial features.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to test relatives at risk* for the ALK pathogenic variant found in the proband to identify those at high risk for neuroblastoma, for whom early detection of neuroblastoma and initiation of therapy would likely improve quality of life and may affect outcome (if therapy is started prior to end organ damage).

*Sibs who are younger than age ten years at the time of diagnosis of the proband, as well as sibs born subsequently.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from preventive measures. Those found to have alkaptonuria should be counseled to avoid high-impact and contact sports. Career considerations include avoidance of occupations involving heavy physical labor. Instruction on joint strengthening and flexibility exercises, in conjunction with appropriate physical activity, can help preserve overall joint mobility and function.

Evaluations can include:

Biochemical testing for the presence of elevated urinary homogentisic acid (HGA).

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
The ATS/ERS guidelines recommend evaluation of older and younger sibs of an individual with severe AATD (Table 2) in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from institution of treatment and preventive measures.

The ATS/ERS guidelines also recommend testing for parents and children of individuals with severe AATD.

Extended pedigree analysis beyond first-degree relatives may be indicated in selected instances. For example, the presence of an AATD-associated condition (e.g., COPD, liver disease, panniculitis) in a more distant family member would justify extensive family testing (i.e., of family members beyond parents, sibs, and offspring).

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Management of women with AATD during pregnancy should be guided by usual care principles, both for women without clinical disease and for those with liver disease. As noted, emphysema, especially in non-smokers, would not commonly be expected during the usual childbearing age range.
It is appropriate to evaluate family members at risk for Alport syndrome or thin basement membrane nephropathy in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

Urinalysis

Males. A single urinalysis is sufficient in a male.

Females. Several urinalyses should be performed in females before concluding that hematuria is absent.

Molecular genetic testing. If the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk family members. Molecular genetic testing is necessary to exclude heterozygosity in an at-risk female who does not have hematuria.

Relatives found to have proteinuria, hypertension, and/or a pathogenic variant should be referred to a nephrologist for further evaluation. In the absence of proteinuria or hypertension, relatives at risk should, at a minimum, have an annual urinalysis and measurement of blood pressure if molecular genetic testing is not available.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to perform molecular genetic testing on relatives at risk for ALPS-FAS, ALPS-FASLG, or ALPS-CASP10 if the pathogenic variant has been identified in the proband.

Relatives who have the family-specific pathogenic variant should:

Be advised of their increased risk for ALPS if the type and location of the ALPS-related pathogenic variant is predicted to have a high penetrance for clinical ALPS;

Undergo ALPS-specific evaluations at initial diagnosis (e.g., enumeration of α/β-DNT cells, detection of autoantibodies, IL-10/soluble FasL measurement) (see Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis);

Be advised that ALPS-specific evaluations or other assessments may need to be repeated at regular intervals, particularly if the family member is young and/or if new health-related issues consistent with ALPS or ALPS-related complications (e.g., lymphoma) become apparent (see Surveillance).

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

In addition to the risks and benefits to a woman with ALPS associated with treatment with corticosteroids, mycophenylate mofitil, or sirolimus during pregnancy, the potential teratogenic risks of these exposures to the fetus must also be weighed.

See MotherToBaby for further information on medication use during pregnancy.

Early evaluation and/or molecular genetic testing (if the two pathogenic allelic variants in a family are known) of at-risk sibs allows for early diagnosis and early treatment of manifestations.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

There are no data to guide the management of a pregnancy should it occur in a female with Alström syndrome. Potential maternal complications during pregnancy could include development or worsening of cardiac, renal, or hepatic failure; severe dyslipidemia; and hyperglycemia. The fetus could be affected by placental dysfunction resulting from maternal diabetes and cardiorenal disease. Intensive multidisciplinary surveillance of any pregnancy would be mandatory.

It is appropriate to evaluate the apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from institution of treatment and preventive measures.

Evaluations can include karyotype in sibs who have normal external female genitalia but have not yet undergone menarche.

Molecular genetic testing can be pursued next if a phenotypic female is found to have a 46,XY karyotype and if the AR variant in the family is known.

Androgen binding assays may be considered if an AR variant has not been identified in the family.

It is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk of inheriting the APOE p.Leu167del variant in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from preventive measures and surveillance.

Molecular genetic testing can be used to determine if a family member has inherited the APOE p.Leu167del variant.

If the APOE p.Leu167del variant is found, testing for the presence of an APOE e2 allele (see Diagnosis) is recommended.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to molecular genetic testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

A woman with the APOE p.Leu167del variant should have triglyceride levels measured when pregnancy is identified and at least one to two times later in pregnancy as severe hypertriglyceridemia (>500 mg/dL) in pregnancy increases the risk for pancreatitis and fetal and maternal death. Of note, hypercholesterolemia alone does not present a risk in pregnancy.

Treatment of hypertriglyceridemia in pregnant women is similar to that for nonpregnant individuals. The goal of therapy is to achieve fasting triglyceride levels below 500 mg/dL (see Treatment of Manifestations regarding dietary advice to lower triglycerides).

If acceptable triglyceride levels are not achieved in a pregnant woman with dietary changes alone, medical therapy may be required.

Medical management in pregnancy usually consists of fibrates (pregnancy category C). Prior to taking a medication during pregnancy, a pregnant woman should discuss with her physician the risks and benefits of the specific medication being prescribed.

Due to theoretic concerns regarding the role of cholesterol in embryonic development and the fact that hypercholesterolemia alone does not present a risk in pregnancy, statin therapy is contraindicated during pregnancy. Women who are taking a statin should discontinue the use of this medication prior to conception, if possible, or as soon as the pregnancy is recognized. However, inadvertent exposure early in gestation is unlikely to lead to a significantly increased risk for adverse fetal outcomes [Pollack et al 2005].

Fish oil could be considered, but could alter prostaglandin metabolism in the fetus.

Severe hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis can require apheresis and use of intravenous insulin and glucose. In these circumstances, consultation with a lipid specialist is recommended.
Once the pathogenic variants in a family have been identified, it is recommended that sibs of an affected individual undergo molecular genetic testing or APRT enzyme activity measurements to allow early diagnosis and treatment in order to improve long-term outcome. Further investigations, including assessment of renal function and urinalysis, are warranted in individuals with biallelic pathogenic variants.

Note: Approximately 15% of individuals with APRT deficiency may be asymptomatic [Edvardsson et al 2001, Bollée et al 2010]; they are usually identified during family screening.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

The safety of allopurinol in human pregnancy has not been systematically studied.

Animal studies using high doses of allopurinol have revealed evidence of adverse fetal effects in mice but not in rats or rabbits; it is not clear if these effects are a result of direct fetal toxicity or maternal toxicity. Thus, allopurinol should only be prescribed during pregnancy when the benefit of treatment is believed to outweigh the risk. Treatment with allopurinol during pregnancy should be considered in women with APRT deficiency who have CKD with reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or who have undergone kidney transplantation.

Some post-transplantation immunosuppressive therapies can also have adverse effects on the developing fetus.

A thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of maternal medication use during pregnancy should ideally take place with an appropriate health care provider prior to conception.
Because the age of onset of arginase deficiency is delayed beyond the newborn period and the manifestations can vary, the genetic status of all sibs of a proband (especially the younger ones) should be clarified so that morbidity can be reduced by early diagnosis and treatment in those who are affected. Testing methods can include any one of the following:

Plasma quantitative amino acid analysis

Molecular genetic testing (if the family-specific ARG1 pathogenic variants are known)

Analysis of enzymatic activity in red blood cells

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

The authors are not aware of any instance in which pregnancy has been reported in a woman with arginase deficiency; therefore, no inference can be drawn about the safety of pregnancy for the mother or the fetus.
Evaluation of at-risk sibs (either by molecular genetic testing if the family-specific pathogenic variants are known or by biochemical testing) shortly after birth can reduce morbidity by permitting early diagnosis and treatment of those who are affected.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

It is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband with ATS in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from institution of surveillance and preventive measures.

If the SLC2A10 pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known, at-risk sibs should be evaluated for signs of the disorder (clinically and with echocardiography or more elaborative vascular imaging, as clinical symptoms may be very subtle) to clarify their genetic status.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Data on the management of women with arterial tortuosity syndrome during pregnancy and delivery are limited with only three pregnancies reported (in 2 women) to date. All pregnancies had a good outcome; however, one woman experienced pelvic organ prolapse following the vaginal delivery of her first child [Castori et al 2012]. The other woman, who delivered without complications at 34 weeks’ gestation by elective cesarean section, was started on acetylsalicylic acid to prevent thromboembolic events eight days post partum [Allen et al 2009].

Preconception counseling should include possible pregnancy-associated risks to the mother and medication-associated risks to the fetus.

The risks to the mother are mainly those of aortic root dilatation and dissection. As is common practice in management in Marfan syndrome, elective aortic repair using a valve-sparing procedure (if possible) could be performed prior to conception when the aortic root diameter reaches 45 mm.

Currently, no data are available on a possible risk for pregnancy-associated uterine rupture (as is seen in Loeys-Dietz syndrome and EDS, vascular type). Prenatal and postnatal physiotherapy can minimize the risk for pelvic organ prolapse.

Peripartum intensive monitoring is advised. Pregnancies should be followed by a high-risk obstetrician and a cardiologist familiar with this or related conditions.

Increased surveillance of the aortic root and previously detected aneurysms during pregnancy and following delivery is recommended because of the increased risk for progressive dilatation. Echocardiography is suggested every two to three months from conception until six months post partum.

Delivery should be planned in a center with experience with this or related conditions. It is currently unclear whether caesarean section or vaginal delivery is preferable.

Medication-associated risks to the fetus. The effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) on the fetus in the first trimester of pregnancy are incompletely understood; however, use in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can lead to fetal death and damage. Angiotensin II receptor 1 antagonists (ATIIR1) such as losartan are thought to lead to similar fetal effects as ACE-I, including fetal damage, oligohydramnios, and fetal death, if taken during the second and/or third trimesters of pregnancy.

Ideally, women with ATS who are planning a pregnancy should transition to a different antihypertensive medication (e.g., a beta-blocker) prior to conception.

Women with ATS who become pregnant while taking an ACE-I or an ATIIR1 should be transitioned to a different antihypertensive medication as soon as the pregnancy is recognized.

Women undergoing a non-valve sparing aortic root replacement before pregnancy should be advised of the risk associated with anticoagulant therapy during pregnancy.
Females at risk of being carriers should be evaluated for the family-specific PRPS1 pathogenic variant because clinical manifestations observed in carriers may only become apparent at a later age.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to offer molecular genetic testing to relatives at risk for ARVC (even those age <18 years) if the pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member so that morbidity and mortality can be reduced by early diagnosis and treatment. Predictive testing should be offered in the context of formal genetic counseling.

Note: The initial molecular testing in the proband should encompass ARVC-related genes as a gene panel because of the high rate of digenic heterozygosity (a heterozygous pathogenic variant in two different genes) and to increase the yield of genetic testing [Barahona-Dussault et al 2010, Bauce et al 2010, Christensen et al 2010, Xu et al 2010, Nakajima et al 2012]. Once one (or more) family-specific variant(s) have been identified, targeted variant testing is performed in relatives.

Guidelines exist for screening for cardiac involvement in asymptomatic first-degree relatives at risk for ARVC [Hershberger et al 2009, Charron et al 2010]:

If the family-specific pathogenic variant has been identified in the asymptomatic at-risk relative, screening for cardiac involvement is recommended yearly between ages ten and 50 years.

If genetic testing has not been performed or did not identify a pathogenic variant in an affected family member, screening for cardiac involvement is recommended for asymptomatic at-risk first-degree relatives every three to five years after age ten years.

Screening for cardiac involvement comprises the following [Hershberger et al 2009, Charron et al 2010]:

Medical history with attention to heart failure symptoms, arrhythmia, presyncope, and syncope

ECG, with consideration of signal-averaged electrocardiogram

Echocardiogram

Holter monitoring

Cardiac MRI

At-risk first-degree relatives with any abnormal clinical screening tests for cardiac involvement should be considered for repeat clinical screening in one year [Hershberger et al 2009].

Children younger than age ten are not usually screened, as ARVC features are not usually seen in children before this age. See Hamilton & Fidler [2009] for a review of screening for ARVC in the young. A recent MRI study of ARVC in the young suggested that MRI increases sensitivity but that it was still unusual, even with this more sensitive modality, to see ARVC in children before age ten years [Etoom et al 2015].

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Case reports describe successful outcomes in women with ARVC who are pregnant and give birth [Agir et al 2014, Cozzolino et al 2014]. Specific guidelines for managing ARVC in pregnancy have not been developed, but affected individuals need to be monitored by a multidisciplinary team.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Predictive testing should be offered to all sibs of a proband, as timely treatment with vitamin E supplementation may completely avert the clinical manifestations of the disease.

All relatives at risk, especially younger sibs of a proband, should be evaluated for vitamin E deficiency.

If plasma vitamin E concentration is low, the person should be tested for presence of the TTPA pathogenic variants found in the proband so that individuals with biallelic pathogenic variants can be treated promptly with vitamin E supplementation.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Reduced vitamin E levels are associated with low fertility and embryo resorption in mice [Traber & Manor 2012] and α-tocopherol transfer protein is highly expressed in the human placenta [Müller-Schmehl et al 2004]; therefore, it is advisable to keep vitamin E levels in the high normal range during pregnancy.
It is appropriate to evaluate older and younger sibs of a proband as early as possible. Early detection of anemia, the primary manifestation of β-thalassemia, allows prompt, appropriate treatment and monitoring.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known, hematologic testing can be used to clarify the disease status of at-risk sibs.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Provided that a multidisciplinary team is available, pregnancy is possible and safe, and usually has a favorable outcome in women with β-thalassemia. An increasing number of women with thalassemia major and thalassemia intermedia may, therefore, have children. Although hypogonadotropic hypogonadism remains a common condition in thalassemia major, gonadal function is usually intact and fertility is usually retrievable.

Pregnancy also appears to be safe in most women with thalassemia intermedia, although larger and more detailed studies are needed. Indeed, an increased risk for certain complications cannot yet be excluded. For example, women with thalassemia intermedia who had never previously received a blood transfusion or who had received a minimal quantity of blood are reported to be at risk for severe alloimmune anemia if blood transfusions are required during pregnancy [Origa et al 2010].
It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual by molecular genetic testing for the BAP1 pathogenic variant in the family in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of screening and preventive measures.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger brothers of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

If the TAZ pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk male sibs.

If the TAZ pathogenic variant in the family is not known, testing by means of MLCL:CL ratio (if available) can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk male sibs.

If MLCL:CL ratio is not available, a combination of urine organic acid analysis, complete blood count with differential, and echocardiogram may be able to clarify the genetic status of at-risk male sibs. However, such testing cannot completely exclude a diagnosis of Barth syndrome.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Given that Barth syndrome has been variably associated with different prenatal complications including intrauterine growth restriction, oligohydramnios, intrauterine ventricular dysfunction, and hydrops fetalis [Cardonick et al 1997, Steward et al 2010], it seems prudent to recommend that pregnancies of male fetuses known to have Barth syndrome be managed by a high-risk maternal fetal obstetrician. Of note, there are no specific recommendations regarding mode, timing, or location of delivery.
Sibs or relatives who have clinical features similar to those of the individual with BBS warrant genetic consultation. If the relative is deemed affected, molecular genetic testing, consultation with an ophthalmologist, and a renal sonogram to evaluate for structural renal malformations are recommended.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Expectant mothers affected with BBS require close monitoring for any deterioration in renal function or pregnancy-related complications due to structural abnormalities of the reproductive tract.
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives, including children, of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from surveillance (see Surveillance) for complications of NBCCS (most notably medulloblastoma in children and jaw cysts and BCCs in adults) and the need to avoid x-rays and sun exposure (see Agents/Circumstances to Avoid).

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant in the family is known;

Clinical examination and x-rays of the skull for calcification if the pathogenic variant in the family is not known; these may be less likely to clarify the genetic status in a very young child because of the age-related features of NBCCS.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Since individuals with NBCCS have a large head circumference, a woman who is carrying an affected fetus should be assessed for the need for either early induction of labor or caesarean section delivery due to cephalopelvic disproportion.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

For a pregnant woman with a collagen VI-related disorder, no specific pregnancy management issues exist; however, prenatal physiotherapy may be indicated.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

The pregnancy management of a woman with a KCNQ2 pathogenic variant and epilepsy does not differ from that of any other pregnant woman with a seizure disorder.

A fetus with a KCNQ2 pathogenic variant may have neonatal seizures in the first few days of life. Therefore, a woman who is carrying a fetus at risk of inheriting a KCNQ2-related disorder should consider delivering in a hospital with a neonatal intensive care unit.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
If the pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, perform molecular genetic testing on at-risk relatives (e.g., sibs of the proband) in order to begin biotin and thiamine therapy as soon as possible in all individuals with biallelic SLC19A3 pathogenic variants, even those who are asymptomatic.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Affected women should continue biotin and thiamine therapy during pregnancy. No information regarding risk to the fetus of an affected mother is available.
When the family-specific pathogenic variant is known, use of molecular genetic testing for early identification of at-risk family members improves diagnostic certainty and reduces costly screening procedures in at-risk members who have not inherited the pathogenic variant.

Early recognition of clinical manifestations may allow timely intervention and improve outcome. Therefore, clinical surveillance of asymptomatic at-risk relatives for early detection is appropriate.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
A newborn with an older sib with biotinidase deficiency should be treated at birth with biotin pending results of the definitive biotinidase enzyme activity assay and/or molecular genetic testing (if the BTD pathogenic variants in the family are known).

The genetic status of older sibs (even if asymptomatic) of a child with biotinidase deficiency should be clarified by assay of biotinidase enzyme activity or molecular genetic testing (if the BTD pathogenic variants in the family are known) so that biotin therapy can be instituted in a timely manner.

The genetic status of any relative with symptoms consistent with biotinidase deficiency should be clarified by assay of biotinidase enzyme activity or molecular genetic testing (if the BTD pathogenic variants in the family are known) so that biotin therapy can be instituted in a timely manner.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

The only special pregnancy management considerations for a woman who is carrying a baby with biotinidase deficiency or is at risk of having a baby with biotinidase deficiency is consideration of biotin supplementation of the mother. An optimal prenatal dose has not been determined.
It is appropriate to evaluate sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from avoidance of sun exposure to the face and early surveillance for cancer (see Surveillance).

Molecular genetic testing can be used to evaluate sibs if the BLM pathogenic variants in the family are known.

An unusually low birth weight followed by short stature throughout childhood is typically present in affected sibs; sibs of normal stature are likely unaffected and may not need further testing.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to the testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic relatives at risk for BOR/BOS to determine if a treatable and/or possibly progressive otologic and/or renal abnormality is present.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant in the family is known;

Comprehensive physical examination (to include hearing evaluation and renal imaging and function studies) if the pathogenic variant in the family is not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Because women with mild manifestations of BPAN could potentially reproduce, the potential for teratogenic effects of medication taken during pregnancy needs to be considered.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Once a cancer-predisposing BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline variant has been identified in a family, testing of at-risk relatives can identify those family members who also have the familial variant and thus need increased surveillance and early intervention when a cancer is identified.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
If the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, molecular genetic testing of at-risk relatives is appropriate because:

ECG changes have low sensitivity in establishing the diagnosis [Priori et al 2003];

Identification of individuals at risk allows preventive measures such as avoidance of medications that can induce ventricular arrhythmias;

Surveillance can then be limited to family members who have the identified pathogenic variant [Benito et al 2009, Escárcega et al 2009, Nunn et al 2010].

If the pathogenic variant has not been identified in the family, relatives should be screened with an ECG. If a type I ECG is identified, further investigation is warranted.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Hormonal changes during pregnancy can precipitate arrhythmic events in women with Brugada syndrome. Recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmia can be inhibited and the electrocardiographic pattern can normalize following IV infusion of low-dose isoproterenol followed by oral quinidine [Sharif-Kazemi et al 2011].

Quinidine is not known to be teratogenic to the developing fetus and is a preferred drug to treat arrhythmia in pregnancy. For more information about medication use during pregnancy, visit www.mothertobaby.org.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Affected pregnant women should be followed in a high-risk pregnancy care unit by a multidisciplinary team including a specialist in fetal medicine and an expert in diabetic management. Pregnancy may increase the risk of diabetic decompensation. Babies born to women with diabetes are at an increased risk for fetal anomalies and postnatal complications compared to babies born to women without diabetes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate the newborn sib of an individual with BWS in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of preventive measures.

Evaluations can include:

Genetic testing if a maternal CDKN1C pathogenic variant or familial duplication, deletion, or cytogenetically visible alteration of 11p15 is known;

Monitoring of an at-risk newborn sib for hypoglycemia, even in the absence of obvious clinical findings on prenatal investigation;

Strong consideration of tumor surveillance for the apparently unaffected twin of monozygotic twins who are discordant for BWS, given the possibility of shared fetal circulation and resulting somatic mosaicism.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
When both CA5A pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, it is appropriate to evaluate all sibs in order to identify those who would benefit from prompt treatment when symptoms appear.

Of note, in some families, asymptomatic (older) sibs were found to have biallelic CA5A pathogenic variants through family screening [van Karnebeek et al 2014b]. This finding suggests a possible “susceptibility period” during childhood after which individuals with biallelic CA5A pathogenic variants may no longer be at risk of developing signs of CA-VA deficiency.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management 

For an affected mother. No pregnancy manaagement issues are known.

For an affected child

No special management is required during pregnancy.

Delivery in hospital is indicated with monitoring for several days (including physical examination and measurement of plasma ammonia, serum lactate, serum glucose, blood gases, plasma amino acids, and urine organic acids).
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Although no formal studies have been performed, no evidence from clinical practice suggests that fetuses affected with CADASIL are at an increased risk for intrauterine complications or complications during/after delivery.

Women with a NOTCH3 pathogenic variant have been described as at increased risk for neurologic events in pregnancy during and shortly after delivery (puerperium) [Roine et al 2005]. However, it should be noted that this study was performed retrospectively. In the authors’ experience, most women with CADASIL have an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery, but transient neurologic events are sometimes reported (mostly consistent with migraine aura) [Lesnik Oberstein, unpublished observation based on clinical practice].
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

No special recommendations for management of either a fetus known to be heterozygous for the disease-defining pathogenic variant or a mother known to have had Caffey disease in childhood.
If prenatal testing for 21-OHD CAH has not been performed, it is appropriate to evaluate newborn sibs of a proband in order to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment.

Serum 17-OHP concentration should be measured in addition to newborn screening.

Molecular genetic testing is indicated if the pathogenic variants in the family are known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnant females with classic 21-OHD CAH. Pregnant females who have classic salt-wasting 21-OHD CAH need to be monitored closely by an endocrinologist during pregnancy. Maintenance doses of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid usually need to be increased because adrenal androgens tend to increase during pregnancy. Despite excess production of maternal adrenal androgens, the genitalia of their female fetuses are not virilized [Lo et al 1999].
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
If the pathogenic ABCC9 or KCNJ8 variant in an affected family member is known, relatives at risk who are suspected of having Cantú syndrome can be offered molecular genetic testing to clarify their genetic status. Family members who are affected should be evaluated (see Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis and Surveillance).

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy of a fetus with Cantú syndrome warrants monitoring for:

Polyhydramnios. The cause of polyhydramnios is unknown. In some instances, severe polyhydramnios has required serial amniotic fluid reductions and has led to premature labor and delivery.

Macrosomia. It is unknown if fetal size warrants special consideration at the time of delivery.
It has been speculated that hypertension or smoking may influence the age of onset and frequency of stroke episodes in individuals with CARASIL; smoking may result in earlier disease onset [Singhal et al 2004] and smoking or hypertension may increase the frequency of stroke episodes in individuals with CADASIL [Samii et al 2010]. Therefore, it is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures such as oral administration of anti-hypertensive drugs and abstinence from smoking.

If the HTRA1 pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known, brain MRI can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

No special management is necessary in pregnancy for individual with CARASIL.
It is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures (see Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis and Surveillance).

If the PRKAR1A pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate the sibs of a proband with DIS in infancy or early childhood in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early support and management of hearing loss. Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing for the causative contiguous gene deletion;

Otologic examination and audiologic assessment.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, at-risk sibs may be tested prenatally to allow initiation of treatment as soon as possible after birth.

If the newborn sibling of an affected individual has not undergone prenatal testing, the infant can be tested in the first week of life by urine organic acids, plasma amino acids, measurement of total plasma homocysteine, and acylcarnitine profile analysis for the purpose of early diagnosis and treatment. If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to confirm the diagnosis.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

A good pregnancy outcome was reported in a woman with cblC treated with OHCbl 1.0 mg IM, folic acid 5.0 mg per day, aspirin 80 mg per day, levocarnitine, and low-protein diet [Brunel-Guitton et al 2010].

Prenatal therapy of an affected fetus by administration of intramuscular OHCbl to the mother may decrease developmental abnormalities and improve neurocognitive outcome [Huemer et al 2005, Trefz et al 2012] but does not appear to affect the ophthalmologic outcome [Patton et al 2000]. The dose and frequency of administration of IM OHCbl has not been established. Favorable outcomes of prenatal treatment have been reported by using dosages between 1 to 10 mg per day, 2-3 times a week, starting as early as 15 weeks’ gestational age [Huemer et al 2005, Trefz et al 2012].
Using the CLCN2 pathogenic variants identified in the proband, it is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify those who would benefit from early diagnosis and routine surveillance for motor, cognitive, vision, and hearing impairment.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

No pregnancy complications have been identified in affected women to date [Author, personal observation].
Establishing the diagnosis of CCA early in at-risk relatives may permit more careful surveillance of affected individuals (see Surveillance).

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management 

Pregnant women with CCD should be monitored closely for cephalopelvic disproportion, which may require delivery by cesarean section.
It is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

If the CTDP1 pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known careful monitoring of at-risk sibs for the early disease manifestations (ocular, delayed motor milestones, early signs of peripheral neuropathy) will ensure timely diagnosis of those affected.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Experience is very limited, as only three females with CCFDN are known to have given birth [Tournev et al 2001, Walter et al 2014]. The pregnancies are reported as uneventful and were carried to term. Normal pregnancy and delivery have also been reported by mothers of children with CCFDN.
It is appropriate to evaluate both symptomatic and apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of screening and preventive measures.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant in the family is known.

Brain and/or spinal cord MRI imaging including GRE or SWI if the pathogenic variant in the family is not known

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnant women with FCCM who have had recent brain or spinal cord hemorrhage, epilepsy, or migraine will require closer observation during pregnancy. Baseline MRI one year prior to delivery is recommended to determine lesion locations [De Jong et al 2012, Witiw et al 2012, Yamada et al 2013].

Simonazzi et al [2014] reported six women with CCM who had symptoms such as seizure or focal neurologic deficit during pregnancy or within six weeks post-delivery. Reviewing the literature they found ten further cases in which pregnancy outcome was published. Of the 16 women, hemorrhage occured in ten. Preterm delivery occurred in four of six cases, one because of neurologic symptoms at 30 weeks. Cæsarean (C-)section was performed in nine cases, eight of which were for concern over CCM.

Affected women and obstetricians are frequently concerned that the risk of increased blood pressure and intrathoracic pressure during stage 3 labor (pushing phase) could lead to CCM hemorrhage. However, in a study of 168 pregnancies (64 women), 28 with sporadic CCM and 36 with FCCM, only five symptomatic cerebral hemorrhages were reported, most commonly manifesting as seizures. Nineteen deliveries in this study were by C-section, mostly due to fear of possible intracranial hemorrhage. The risk of CCM hemorrhage was higher in the familial cases (3.6% compared with 1.8% in sporadic cases) [Kalani & Zabramski 2013].

In general, women with epilepsy or a seizure disorder from any cause are at greater risk for mortality during pregnancy than pregnant women without a seizure disorder; use of antiepileptic medication during pregnancy reduces this risk. However, exposure to antiepileptic medication may increase the risk for adverse fetal outcome (depending on the drug used, the dose, and the stage of pregnancy at which medication is taken). Nevertheless, the risk of an adverse outcome to the fetus from medication exposure is often less than that associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Therefore, use of antiepileptic medication during pregnancy is typically recommended. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given antiepileptic drug during pregnancy should ideally take place prior to conception. Transitioning to a lower-risk medication prior to pregnancy may be possible [Sarma et al 2016].

To access further information on medication use during pregnancy, visit MotherToBaby.
Because CCD is associated with an increased risk for MH susceptibility, it is appropriate to test at-risk relatives of a proband (whether symptomatic or not) for the RYR1 pathogenic variant identified in the proband in order to caution those with the pathogenic variant about potential risks of inhalational anesthetics and succinylcholine. See Malignant Hyperthermia Susceptibility for more details.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Because all patients with CCD are considered to be at risk for malignant hyperthermia, inhalational anesthetics and succinylcholine should be avoided while considering general or regional anesthesia for delivery. Similar to most neuromuscular disorders, clinical progression of disease can be expected in CCD [Sax & Rosenbaum 2006].
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Evaluation of the younger sibs of a proband for early manifestations of CDA I is recommended so that monitoring of hemoglobin and ferritin levels and treatment can begin as soon as necessary in those who are affected.

Evaluation of at-risk family members should include CBC to identify macrocytic anemia as well as typical findings on blood smear including macrocytosis, elliptocytes, and basophilic stippling.

The diagnosis can be confirmed by molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family have been identified.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Anemia places pregnancies of affected women at high risk for delivery-related and outcome complications [Shalev et al 2008].
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment (in the treatable forms of N-linked CDG) and those who require developmental monitoring and medical management.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known;

Serum transferrin analysis if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are not known and transferrin was abnormal in the proband.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to evaluation of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger at-risk relatives of an individual with CDPX1 in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early screening for hearing loss. If the ARSE pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to evaluation of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Sibs of affected individuals should be tested by measuring plasma carnitine concentrations. If the carnitine levels are low, further evaluation for CDSP is recommended by molecular genetic testing if the SLC22A5 pathogenic variants have been identified in the family or fibroblast carnitine transport assay.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy is a metabolically challenging state because energy consumption significantly increases. In addition, plasma carnitine levels are physiologically lower during pregnancy than those of non-pregnant controls. Affected women can have decreased stamina or worsening of cardiac arrhythmia during pregnancy, suggesting that CDSP may manifest or exacerbate during pregnancy [Schimmenti et al 2007, El-Hattab et al 2010]. Therefore, all pregnant women with CDSP, including those who are asymptomatic, require close monitoring of plasma carnitine levels and increased carnitine supplementation as needed to maintain normal plasma carnitine levels.
If the pathogenic variants are known in a family, it is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of at-risk infants to allow early diagnosis and appropriate management and surveillance, particularly for respiratory complications, renal and liver disease, and visual impairment.

If the pathogenic variants are not known in a family, the following is recommended for at-risk children:

In the newborn period: physical examination by a pediatrician, and consultation with a clinical geneticist as determined by the clinical findings

Age 0-3 months: kidney and liver evaluation, including ultrasound examination and measurement of blood pressure, serum creatinine concentration, and liver enzymes

At six-month intervals: repeat the kidney and liver evaluations.

Parents should be alerted to the signs of CED and advised to contact their child’s healthcare provider if suspicious symptoms, such as polydipsia and/or jaundice, appear.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
To date, all individuals with germline pathogenic CEBPA variants have presented with overt AML without any preceding blood count abnormalities or myelodysplasia, this in contrast with other familial leukemia syndromes such as those associated with germline RUNX1 or GATA2 pathogenic variants [Nickels et al 2013].

The decision to test for an inherited pathogenic variant is ultimately governed by personal choice, the reassurance of regular clinical follow up, and provision of genetic counseling. It is noteworthy that clinical monitoring may enable earlier diagnosis (and treatment) of AML, hence minimizing the risks associated with delayed presentation (e.g., severe anemia, neutropenic sepsis, and severe hemorrhage), providing further rationale for molecular evaluation of at-risk relatives. There are currently no preemptive treatments available for asymptomatic carriers of a germline CEBPA pathogenic variant.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk in order to identify the diagnosis as early as possible, avoid potential misdiagnosis, and provide appropriate treatment for extremity pain.

If the TGFB1 pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, radiographic evaluation for hyperostosis can be used to clarify the disease status of at-risk relatives.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Molecular genetic testing of first-degree relatives of individuals with celiac disease can identify those who are susceptible to developing celiac disease and who would benefit from serologic testing to screen for celiac disease or silent celiac disease. Of note, first-degree relatives do not need to be symptomatic to consider molecular genetic testing. (See Testing Strategies, In a Symptomatic Individual who is on a Gluten-Free Diet, Molecular genetic testing.)

Early diagnosis of celiac disease and treatment with a gluten-free diet can prevent secondary complications.

Individuals who do not have the celiac disease-associated HLA alleles DQ2 and DQ8 do not need to undergo serologic screening for celiac disease.

Individuals who have celiac disease-associated HLA alleles (Table 3) are followed by celiac disease-associated antibody testing at three- to five-year intervals.

Small-bowel biopsy is recommended when celiac disease-associated antibody testing is positive.

A definitive diagnosis of celiac disease is made in a person with a positive small-bowel biopsy and clinical and/or histologic improvement on a gluten-free diet.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate at-risk sibs as newborns or infants in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early intervention (no phototherapy, strict sun protection) and future monitoring for signs of hemolytic anemia. Evaluations include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known;

Biochemical testing for urinary or erythrocyte uroporphyrin I and coproporphyrin I isomer elevation if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Successful pregnancies in women with CEP resulting in healthy and unaffected children have been described [Hallai et al 2007, Katugampola et al 2012b].

Protective filters for artificial lights should be used in the delivery/operating room to prevent phototoxic damage to the mother during delivery [Wahlin et al 2008].
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of a proband/at-risk relatives in order to identify as early as possible those who should be referred to a cystic fibrosis center for initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known;

Sweat chloride testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancies are well tolerated with improved nutrition, improved pulmonary treatment, aggressive management of infections, and a multidisciplinary care team, especially in women with mild to moderate disease. Pregnancy is not associated with an increased risk of death [Goss et al 2003]. In all studies published to date, the most important predictors of pregnancy outcome are the severity of maternal pulmonary impairment and nutritional status; deterioration during pregnancy may precipitate preterm delivery.

Females with CF of reproductive age should receive preconception counseling and take steps to optimize health prior to pregnancy.

The management of pregnancy and the immediate post-partum period for a woman with CF requires a dietician, members of the CF team, and a maternal fetal medicine specialist.

Maternal nutritional status and weight gain should be monitored and optimized aggressively and pulmonary exacerbations should be treated early.

Traditional screening paradigms for gestational diabetes mellitus may not be useful in pregnancies of women with CF; therefore, screening at each trimester of pregnancy has been suggested to improve the detection of diabetes mellitus.

As in pregnancies of women with other forms of diabetes mellitus, fetal outcome is optimized when glycemic control is achieved prior to pregnancy.

Mode of delivery is based on usual obstetric indications.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

A pregnant female suspected of having CFC syndrome warrants obstetric care from a trained maternal-fetal-medicine physician due to possible polyhydramnios, cardiac issues, and/or hypertension.
It is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

If the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

If the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are not known, clinical ophthalmologic exam can be used to clarify the disease status of at-risk relatives.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy has not been specifically studied in women or fetuses with CFTD. Women with congenital myopathies generally do not experience significant complications during pregnancy or delivery; however, gestation may lead to an increase in symptoms in some women with CFTD and other congenital myopathies, including exacerbation of fatigue and muscle weakness [Rudnik-Schöneborn et al 1997, Sobrido et al 2005].

The pregnancy of a fetus with a congenital myopathy is at an increased risk for complications such as polyhydramnios and reduced fetal movements and the delivery is at an increased risk for breech presentation, fetal distress, failure to progress, and/or prematurity [North & Goebel 2003, North 2004].
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic at-risk relatives in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

Evaluations can include the following:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known

Routine DHR testing of peripheral blood, which will detect the CGD disease state (except for p40phox deficiency) if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are not known

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

The major concern during the pregnancy of a woman known to have CGD is continued use of prophylactic antimicrobials.

Trimethoprim, a folic acid antagonist, is usually avoided in pregnancy

Sulfamethoxazole is not known to increase the risk of birth defects in humans; however, it is typically administered in conjunction with trimethoprim for prophylaxis in affected non-pregnant women.

Data regarding teratogenicity of itraconazole are limited. Although case reports of birth defects in infants born to women taking itraconazole during pregnancy have been published, this observation is not supported by larger case series. Given the lack of adequate data on the use of itraconazole during pregnancy, some practitioners suggest that it should be avoided during pregnancy until such data become available.

The authors’ practice for women with CGD who are or are planning to become pregnant is to use antibacterial prophylaxis (e.g., penicillin- or cephalosporin-based therapies) for which more data on safety during pregnancy exist [Author, personal communication]. Although no antifungal prophylactic medications known to be completely safe during pregnancy are currently available, the risks and benefits of antifungal treatment must be weighed case by case. Interferon gamma is held during pregnancy and restarted after breastfeeding has ceased.

It is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband as early as possible. Early diagnosis may provide the opportunity to perform HSCT prior to the development of the accelerated phase.

If the family-specific pathogenic variants are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known, examination of peripheral blood for the presence of giant inclusions within white blood cells can be used to clarify the disease status of at-risk sibs.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

In the limited cases of pregnancy in females with CHS reported in the literature [Price et al 1992, Weisfeld-Adams et al 2013], presence of the disease had no impact on the pregnancy, labor, or delivery. The infants were normal. The pregnancy also did not appear to affect the course of disease in the affected mothers.
At-risk relatives could be offered clinical and radiographic evaluations given that manifestations may not be evident in all affected individuals. When the disease-causing mutation is known in the proband, molecular genetic testing can be used to evaluate relatives at risk for the disorder. This may allow mildly affected relatives to benefit from early surveillance and intervention.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Early diagnosis of relatives (i.e., sibs) at risk for CHH-AD spectrum disorders is important for early recognition and management of manifestations that can be associated with significant morbidity (e.g., infections, immunization with live vaccines, malignancies). Relatives at risk should be tested if clinical features, especially short stature, are present; completely asymptomatic individuals need not be tested.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known;

Radiographic evaluation and RMRP sequence analysis if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

Pregnancy Management

Females with CISS may conceive normally. No complications during pregnancy have been reported to date.

Treatments for cold-induced sweating (clonidine, amitriptyline, moxonidine) should be discontinued during pregnancy, as the potential for teratogenic effects on the fetus is not well studied and remains possible. The prescription of clonidine should not be discontinued abruptly; the drug should be phased out over four to six days.
It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of at-risk asymptomatic sibs of a proband for citrin deficiency so that appropriate dietary management of infants (discontinuation of breast feeding and introduction of lactose-free and/or MCT-enriched formulas) can be instituted before symptoms occur.

Because asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals with citrin deficiency do not always show biochemical abnormalities, definitive diagnosis of at-risk relatives (e.g., sibs) would depend heavily on SLC25A13 molecular genetic findings in the proband:

If both SLC25A13 pathogenic variants in the index case have been identified, molecular genetic testing can be used reliably.

If only one SLC25A13 pathogenic variant is ascertained in the index case, it may not be feasible to definitively exclude the diagnosis in at-risk relatives who have the one identified pathogenic variant. In such cases, serial clinical and biochemical assessment will be needed over time to confirm or rule out the diagnosis.

If no SLC25A13 pathogenic variant is ascertained in the index case, molecular testing of at-risk individuals will not be helpful. In such cases, serial clinical and biochemical assessment will be needed over time to confirm or rule out the diagnosis

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of an affected individual by molecular genetic testing of the CLCN7 pathogenic variant(s) in the family in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic at-risk relatives of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures, especially newborns or young children, who could benefit from early treatment to prevent sudden respiratory failure.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant in the family is known;

Neurologic/neuropediatric examination, electrophysiologic testing (repetitive nerve stimulation) if the pathogenic variant in the family is not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Data on pregnancies in CMS are limited. Seventeen pregnancies were reported in eight French patients with CMS [Servais et al 2013]. According to these data pregnancy was a frequent cause of clinical exacerbation but the vast majority of patients recovered their pre-pregnancy clinical status six months after delivery. The children’s outcome was excellent, except for one newborn who developed a severe, neonatal (autosomal dominant) slow-channel CMS. Pregnant patients should be closely followed by neurologists during the course of pregnancy. Careful respiratory and cardiac surveillance should be initiated in consultation with obstetric specialists.
It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic at-risk relatives in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and knowledge about agents/circumstances to avoid.

Pregnancy Management

Although no systemic studies have been done concerning pregnancy in women with DI-CMTB, there are reports of an increased occurrence of abnormal fetal presentation and maternal postpartum bleeding in women with CMT in general [Hoff et al 2005]. The early miscarriage rate is not increased in women with CMT [Argov & de Visser 2009].
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Rudnik-Schöneborn et al [1993] evaluated 45 pregnancies in 21 women with CMT1. Worsening of the CMT1 symptoms during or after gestation was reported in about half of pregnancies. A follow-up study of 63 pregnancies in 33 women with CMT showed no serious complications but 20% of women reported a worsening of symptoms during pregnancy [Awater et al 2012]. In a study of affected pregnant women in Norway, deliveries involved a higher occurrence of presentation anomalies, use of forceps, and operative delivery; the women also experienced increased post-partum bleeding [Hoff et al 2005].
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

A German study reviewed 63 pregnancies in 33 women with CMT and found no increase in the frequency of cesarean sections, forceps deliveries, premature births, or neonatal problems [Awater et al 2012].

Argov & de Visser [2009] reviewed pregnancy issues in hereditary neuromuscular disorders including CMT.

Greenwood & Scott [2007] have described the obstetric approach to women with mild and severe forms of CMT.

A Norway study found a higher than average rate of operative deliveries among women with CMT [Hoff et al 2005].

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

There is no registry or data regarding the frequency or outcome of pregnancies in women with a TRPV4-related disorder; however, the following general information may be reasonable to consider.

Ideally a woman with a TRPV4-associated disorder would seek consultation from a high-risk OB/GYN or maternal-fetal-medicine specialist to evaluate her risks for pregnancy and delivery.

TRPV4-associated neuromuscular disorders.

Argov & de Visser [2009] reviewed pregnancy issues in hereditary neuromuscular disorders including CMTs.

About 50% of women with CMT described increased weakness during pregnancy that usually resolved post partum [Rudnik-Schoneborn et al 1993].

Operative deliveries were reported more commonly in women with CMT in Norway [Hoff et al 2005]. Greenwood & Scott [2007] described the obstetric approach to women with mild and severe forms of CMT.

A recent German study reviewed 63 pregnancies in 33 women with CMT [Awater et al 2012] and found no increase in the frequency of Cesarean section, forceps delivery, premature birth, or neonatal problems. About one third of mothers felt a worsening of CMT symptoms during pregnancy; in one fifth of mothers the changes were felt to be persistent.

TRPV4-associated skeletal dysplasias. In TRPV4-associated skeletal dysplasias, the degree of pulmonary compromise (from the short trunk and decreased lung capacity) may affect the ability to carry a pregnancy to term. Thus, it is unlikely a woman with metatropic dysplasia could carry a pregnancy.

A pregnant woman with a TRPV4-assocaited skeletal dysplasia generally undergo cæsarean section delivery because of the small size of the pelvis.

Pregnancy Management

No specific pregnancy management recommendations have been published. However, weight gain during pregnancy may produce additional gait disability.
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of preventive measures. Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known;

Consideration of motor nerve conduction velocities and nerve biopsy if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

CMT appears to be an independent risk factor for complications during pregnancy and delivery.

The symptoms of CMT can worsen during pregnancy; in particular: cramps, subjective sensitivity (e.g., paresthesias), difficulty walking, and fatigue.

In rare cases, crises occurring during pregnancy do not subside post partum.

A retrospective study in Norway between 1967 and 2002 comparing 108 births to mothers with CMT with 2.1 million births to mothers without CMT determined that mothers with CMT more frequently needed interventions during delivery [Hoff et al 2005]. Bleeding post partum was also more common in mothers with CMT.

It has been postulated that fetal presentation tends to be abnormal because of the combination of CMT in the mother and fetus [Rayl et al 1996, Hoff et al 2005].

Because the segmental demyelination in patients with CMT4J is similar to that observed in acquired demyelinating neuropathies, a few patients have been treated with intravenous immunoglobin [Cottenie et al 2013]. No obvious effect has been observed.See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

In pregnant women affected with CS, the limited size of the pelvis and abdomen is the major obstacle to the growth of the fetus and the major threat to the outcome of the pregnancy. Prevention of premature labor and caesarean section under spinal anesthesia are usually needed [Lahiri & Davies 2003, Rawlinson & Webster 2003].
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

As no females with CSS have been reported to reproduce, potential complications of pregnancy are unknown.

Pregnancy Management

Cesarean delivery for pregnancies in which the fetus is at risk for a COL4A1-related disorder is recommended to prevent brain vascular injury attributable to birth trauma in newborns [Gould et al 2006].
Given the importance of early CoQ10 supplementation, it is appropriate to evaluate the sibs of a proband who has primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency in order to identify as early as possible those sibs who would benefit from early initiation of treatment.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known and the diagnosis has been established by biochemical findings, one can consider measuring CoQ10 levels in skin fibroblasts of at-risk sibs [Desbats et al 2015b].

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Because presentation in later childhood is possible, it is appropriate to evaluate each sib of a proband, regardless of age, in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of preventive measures.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the CPT1A pathogenic variants in the family are known.

Enzyme analysis in cultured skin fibroblasts if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Although data are limited, it is prudent to counsel unaffected female carriers regarding the risk for obstetric complications.

Women who have had one child with CPT1A deficiency following an uneventful pregnancy remain at risk for acute fatty liver of pregnancy in subsequent pregnancies with an affected fetus.

Pregnant females who are heterozygous for a CPT1A pathogenic variant should be monitored for acute fatty liver of pregnancy. In any pregnancies that follow identification of a child with CPT1A deficiency, liver function testing should be performed at each prenatal visit during the first two trimesters and more frequently during the third trimester when the risk for acute fatty liver of pregnancy is greatest. Management by a team comprising a maternal-fetal medicine specialist and a medical/biochemical geneticist is highly recommended.
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic at-risk relatives so that morbidity and mortality can be reduced by early diagnosis and treatment. In addition, predictive testing for at-risk asymptomatic family members may be advisable before general anesthesia. Complications of general anesthesia (including rhabdomyolysis and suxamethonium hypersensitivity in individuals with a variety of neuromuscular diseases and renal post-anesthetic failure in individuals with CPT II deficiency in particular) have been observed [Katsuya et al 1988, Wieser et al 2008].

Molecular genetic testing is appropriate if the pathogenic variants in the family are known.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known, screening for alterations in acylcarnitines may be of use to identify other affected family members.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

While a variety of maternal complications have been observed in association with other fatty acid oxidation disorders (severe preeclampsia; acute fatty liver of pregnancy; maternal liver disease; and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets), none of these complications has been associated with CPT II deficiency [Preece & Green 2002, Shekhawat et al 2005].
It is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures. Early diagnosis of at-risk relatives may be beneficial for management of complications from progressive hyperostosis.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, clinical evaluation and cranial and long bone radiographs can be used to clarify the disease status of at-risk relatives.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
At-risk relatives should be evaluated by clinical and radiographic criteria given that manifestations may not be readily evident in all affected individuals. When the pathogenic variant is known in the family, molecular genetic testing can be used to evaluate relatives for the disorder. Early diagnosis may allow mildly affected relatives to benefit from early surveillance and intervention.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate neonates at-risk for GAMT deficiency or AGAT deficiency to allow for early diagnosis and treatment.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known;

Biochemical genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to evaluation of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
In families with known CSCD, at-risk children should be seen by an ophthalmologist within a few months after birth to determine if they have the condition. Alternatively, if the DCN pathogenic variant in the family has been identified, molecular genetic testing of at-risk children can be pursued.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
For infants identified with high myopia, unusual head posture or nystagmus and a family history of CSNB, ophthalmic examination and molecular genetic testing may confirm the diagnosis of CSNB, obviating the need for neuroimaging or clinical electrophysiologic testing under sedation or general anesthesia.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Because the long-term prognosis for individuals with citrullinemia type I depends on initial and peak plasma ammonia concentration, it is important that at-risk sibs be identified as soon as possible.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known; in utero diagnosis (which permits appropriate oral therapy beginning with first feeds), if possible, is preferred.

Measurement of plasma concentrations of ammonia and citrulline on day one of life. Elevation of either above acceptable levels (ammonia >100 µmol/L or plasma citrulline >~100 µmol/L) is sufficient evidence to initiate treatment.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Because women with onset of severe symptoms during pregnancy or in the postpartum period have been reported, scrupulous attention needs to be paid to diet and medication during these periods.
It is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk (e.g., newborn sibs of a proband) in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early treatment to prevent life-threatening complications of cystinosis.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known;

Biochemical testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancies in women with cystinosis are at increased risk for premature delivery and must be monitored closely [Ramappa & Pyatt 2010]. For women who are post-transplantation, the abdominal renal allograft creates mechanical issues. For women who have not undergone transplantation, fluid and electrolyte status require careful management.
It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of an affected individual by molecular genetic testing of the CYP27A1 pathogenic variants in the family in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment. If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known, biochemical testing of at-risk individuals can be pursued.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid should not be interrupted during pregnancy.
It is appropriate to test older and younger sibs for presence of the ATP6V0A2 pathogenic variants found in the proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from institution of treatment and preventive measures.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Because treatment and surveillance are available to reduce morbidity and mortality, first-degree relatives should be offered clinical work up and molecular genetic testing if the family-specific pathogenic allelic variant(s) are known. Indeed, the availability of effective preventive therapies can reduce the number of fatal arrhythmic events if individuals with pathogenic variants are diagnosed early.

If the family-specific pathogenic variant(s) are not known, all first-degree relatives of an affected individual should be evaluated with resting ECG, Holter monitoring, and – most importantly – exercise stress testing.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Beta-blockers (preferentially nadolol or propranolol) should be administered throughout pregnancy in affected women.
Evaluation of at-risk relatives can help identify those with mild or moderately severe disease who may benefit from treatment. If the family-specific ELANE pathogenic variant is known, molecular genetic testing can be used; otherwise serial ANCs can be evaluated.

Note: Complete blood counts (CBCs) obtained weekly for a month until an ANC lower than 0.2 x 109/L is documented in more than one sample confirms the diagnosis. A similar series of counts not showing neutropenia rules out this diagnosis.

Treatment of these individuals with G-CSF or any other modality should be based on medical history and the severity of symptoms. It is not yet clear if there are specific risks (i.e., osteoporosis, myelodysplasia, or leukemia) associated with administering G-CSF to such individuals, but conservative management is recommended.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes

Pregnancy Management 

Pregnancies in women with severe chronic neutropenia are at substantial risk for miscarriage.

A review of the records of 88 women (183 pregnancies) with congenital, cyclic, idiopathic or autoimmune neutropenia compared outcomes in those on G-CSF therapy during pregnancy with those not on G-CSF therapy during pregnancy [Boxer et al 2010]. In general the health of all the infants was equivalent for the two groups. Other findings included:

Reduced risk of fetal loss in the women treated during pregnancy.

Eleven complications (one premature rupture of membranes, two life-threatening infections, two minor infections, and six premature labors) in 55 women (123 pregnancies) not treated with G-CSF during pregnancy.

No life-threatening infections, no premature labors, five minor infections, and one patient who developed severe thrombocytopenia in 41 women (60 pregnancies) treated with G-CSF during pregnancy.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

At least two affected women have successfully given birth [Scurrah et al 2002] following uncomplicated deliveries. Based on these experiences, it is recommended that affected pregnant women have their blood pressure monitored regularly throughout the pregnancy and delivery so that the droxidopa dose can be modified as needed. One or two extra doses of droxidopa should be available to be taken as needed at the time of delivery. Dose adjustment may also be required post partum. The effects of maternal droxidopa therapy on the developing fetus have not been studied in humans; however, studies on pregnant animals do not suggest an increased risk for malformations in offspring.
Heterozygous females need to be identified for the purpose of cardiac surveillance (see Surveillance). Therefore, genetic counseling and molecular genetic testing (if the family-specific pathogenic variant is known) should be offered to females who are the sisters or maternal female relatives of an affected male and to females who are a first-degree relative of a known or possible carrier female.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management for Heterozygous Females

Symptomatic heterozygous women should undergo an evaluation for dilated cardiomyopathy ideally prior to conceiving a pregnancy or as soon as the pregnancy is recognized. Asymptomatic heterozygous women should consider undergoing a cardiac evaluation prior to conception or when a pregnancy is recognized. Those with evidence of dilated cardiomyopathy should be treated and/or monitored by a cardiologist and a high-risk obstetrician.
When the LMNA pathogenic variant has been identified in a family, molecular genetic testing can be offered to relatives at risk in order to facilitate prompt diagnosis, surveillance, and treatment in those in whom the LMNA pathogenic variant has been detected.

If molecular genetic testing is not possible, the first-degree relatives of a proband with LMNA-related DCM should be evaluated annually by medical history, physical examination, echocardiogram, and ECG to determine if any have detectable DCM and/or conduction system disease.

Note: Because the age of onset is variable and penetrance is reduced, a normal baseline echocardiogram and ECG in a first-degree relative who has not undergone molecular genetic testing does not rule out LMNA-related DCM in that individual, and the recommendations set forth in Surveillance should be followed.

Any abnormal cardiovascular test results in a relative of a proband with a known LMNA pathogenic variant should be followed up with a full cardiovascular assessment to evaluate for any acquired causes of disease (e.g., coronary artery disease). Results on screening tests that do not meet criteria for DCM but do show some abnormality (e.g., left ventricular enlargement but normal function; decreased ejection fraction but normal-sized left ventricle) may reflect variable expression of LMNA-related DCM in that relative. Targeted genetic testing to clarify the diagnosis as well as close surveillance (e.g., cardiovascular testing every 1-2 years) for progression of cardiovascular disease is recommended for such individuals.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy is contraindicated in women with DCM because of the significantly increased mortality with pregnancy in DCM. Women with DCM who become pregnant should be followed by a high-risk obstetrician. At-risk women with unknown genetic status should undergo a cardiovascular evaluation and be offered genetic counseling prior to pregnancy.
Using the strategy outlined in Evaluation of First-Degree Relatives of a Proband for Dilated Cardiomyopathy, it is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from surveillance and preventive measures.

When the pathogenic variant(s) are known, relatives may be offered genetic testing to help clarify risk. However, the absence of a likely pathogenic variant in an unaffected relative should be interpreted with caution, as it is possible that some families may have two or more pathogenic variants.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

In most cases, pregnancy is contraindicated in DCM.

Pregnant women with IDC or FDC should be followed by a high-risk obstetrician.

Asymptomatic women with a family history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy may be at risk for peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) and pregnancy-associated cardiomyopathy (PACM). Although PPCM and PACM have traditionally been thought to have an etiology separate from familial dilated cardiomyopathy, evidence supporting a genetic basis is emerging [Elkayam et al 2005, Morales et al 2010, van Spaendonck-Zwarts et al 2010]. Healthcare providers must, therefore, be aware of the possibility of an underlying genetic cause for PPCM/PACM and follow guidelines for the evaluation of DCM (see Evaluation Strategy). Reproductive genetic counseling and genetic testing should be considered in these cases.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Determining in infancy or early childhood whether a relative of a person with DFNA2 nonsyndromic hearing loss has inherited the KCNQ4 deafness-related variant allows for early support and management of the child and the family.

Evaluations may include:

Molecular genetic testing if the deafness-related KCNQ4 variant in the family is known.

Audiometry and sequence analysis of KCNQ4, or a multi-gene panel [Kothiyal et al 2010, Shearer et al 2010, Shearer & Smith 2015] that includes KCNQ4 if the deafness-related variant in the family is not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
If a GJB2 or GJB6 pathogenic variant has been identified in the proband, it is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs shortly after birth so that appropriate early support and management can be provided to the child and family.

It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual to allow early diagnosis and appropriate monitoring for bone marrow failure, physical abnormalities, and related cancers.

Evaluations include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant in the family is known;

Consideration of other testing (e.g., mean corpuscular volume, eADA, and/or fetal hemoglobin concentration) if the pathogenic variant in the family is not known – especially of relatives being considered as bone marrow donors [Vlachos et al 2008].

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Management of pregnancy in marrow failure disorders requires obstetricians with expertise in high-risk pregnancies and hematologists with experience with marrow failure syndromes [Alter et al 1999].

During pregnancy the maternal hemoglobin level must be monitored.

Use of low-dose aspirin up to 37 weeks’ gestation may help prevent vasculo-placental complications in women with a history of a previous problematic pregnancy [Faivre et al 2006].

A study that surveyed 64 pregnancies in women with DBA found a high incidence of complications in both mothers and children. Risks include the following [Faivre et al 2006]:

Intrauterine growth retardation

Preeclampsia

Retroplacental hematoma

In utero fetal death

Preterm delivery
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Although not specific to DTD, women with severe kyphoscoliosis may experience complications related to thoracic compression in later stages of pregnancy and need to be monitored closely. Kyphoscoliosis can also complicate the use of spinal anaesthetics and consultation with an anaesthesiologist prior to delivery would be advisable.
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

Evaluations can include:

Telomere length testing;

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Individuals with DC who become pregnant may develop pancytopenia or existing cytopenias may worsen. They should be followed closely by a perinatologist.
If the DLD pathogenic variants in an affected relative are known, at-risk sibs should undergo molecular genetic testing as soon as possible after birth so that those who have inherited both pathogenic variants can receive appropriate treatment and avoid risk factors that may precipitate an acute event. In some instances, families choose to perform prenatal testing so that treatment can begin shortly after birth for those who have inherited both pathogenic variants.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

The management of pregnant women with PNDM should conform to the guidelines for treatment of other forms of diabetes during gestation [American Diabetes Association 2016b]. Glycemic control during gestation is not only important to prevent complications in the mother, but also to prevent fetal overgrowth (due to fetal hyperinsulinemia triggered by the excess of maternal glucose crossing the placenta) and associated complications. Referral to a maternal-fetal medicine specialist should be considered. In addition, high resolution ultrasonography and fetal echocardiography should be offered during pregnancy to screen for congenital anomalies in the fetus.

Until recently, insulin was the mainstay of therapy of diabetes during pregnancy; however, emerging data support the safety and efficacy of glyburide in the treatment of diabetes during pregnancy [Moretti et al 2008]. Thus, in women with PNDM treated with glyburide before pregnancy, it is reasonable to continue this treatment if appropriate glycemic control can be achieved.
Recommendations vary by underlying genetic mechanism:

When the proband is identified as having TNDM caused by an inherited paternal 6q24 duplication, the sibs and offspring of the proband are at increased risk of inheriting the duplication. Screening for diabetes mellitus is appropriate for those infants who have inherited the paternal 6q24 duplication.

For 6q24-TNDM caused by ZFP57 pathogenic variants, sibs are at a 25% risk for the same condition, although the clinical findings can be variable.

Although individuals reported to have 6q24-TNDM as the result of an imprinting center epimutation have been simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family), it is not clear if all cases are de novo (see also Genetic Counseling).

Screening the mother and sibs of these individuals for diabetes mellitus may be appropriate.

Offspring of female probands with 6q24-TNDM caused by a hypomethylation of the maternal PLAGL1/HYMAI differentially methylated region (DMR) may be at risk of having 6q24-TNDM or of developing diabetes mellitus later in life and should be offered testing.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

There are no specific guidelines on pregnancy management for women with a history of 6q24-TNDM. However, it is important to inform health professionals during the pregnancy of a susceptibility to diabetes. Rarely some affected women with classic 6q24-TNDM genetic aberrations (e.g., duplication of 6q24, paternal UPD 6, methylation mutations) will develop gestational diabetes; therefore, pregnancy is thought to be a risk factor for recurrence of diabetes.

If prenatal diagnosis identifies an affected fetus, fetal growth is anticipated to lag during the third trimester.

It is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives; however, molecular genetic testing cannot predict the occurrence of symptoms, or if they do occur, the age of onset, severity and type of symptoms, or rate of disease progression.

Pregnancy Management

In 20 pregnancies reported in 12 affected individuals, levodopa was continued without adverse effect in most. Two woman experienced remission resulting in a reduction or cessation of therapy. Two women reported mild deterioration of dystonia; an increase in dose was required in one. No fetal abnormalities were identified [Trender-Gerhard et al 2009].
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

In general, women with epilepsy or a seizure disorder from any cause are at greater risk for mortality during pregnancy than pregnant women without a seizure disorder; use of antiepileptic medication during pregnancy reduces this risk. However, exposure to antiepileptic medication may increase the risk for adverse fetal outcome (depending on the drug used, the dose, and the stage of pregnancy at which the medication is taken). Nevertheless, the risk of an adverse outcome to the fetus from medication exposure is often less than that associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Therefore, use of antiepileptic medication during pregnancy is typically recommended. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given antiepileptic drug during pregnancy should ideally take place prior to conception. Transitioning to a lower-risk medication prior to pregnancy may be possible [Sarma et al 2016].

The use of riluzole during pregnancy has not been well studied in humans. One woman took riluzole throughout her pregnancy and delivered a healthy term infant whereas another woman delivered an infant with growth restriction [Kawamichi et al 2010, Scalco et al 2012].

See mothertobaby.org for further information on medication use during pregnancy.
Although reduced penetrance does not appear to be associated with most SALL4 pathogenic variants, unaffected persons may consider molecular genetic testing prior to family planning. Children of affected persons who are themselves not obviously affected may be tested for the pathogenic variant present in the family because individuals with the pathogenic variant should undergo clinical evaluation for hearing problems, renal disease, eye disease, and heart defects.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Ophthalmologic examination within the first year of life is appropriate in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures. If the CHN1 pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Some families with one child with Duarte variant galactosemia wish to evaluate their other children for Duarte variant galactosemia; however, it has not been established that avoidance of all sources of milk and dairy products is warranted in any siblings who test positive for Duarte variant galactosemia.

If the GALT genotype of the proband is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs: sibs can be tested for the presence of the D2 allele and the specific GALT pathogenic variant identified in the proband.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

There are no known additional risks associated with pregnancy for a woman with Duarte variant galactosemia or for a fetus with Duarte variant galactosemia.
Consider genetic testing of sibs of a proband who is known to have an inherited maternal interstitial 15q11.2-q13.1 duplication in order to refer sibs with an interstitial duplication promptly for developmental evaluation and early intervention services

Pregnancy Management

Data on the use of the oral medications typically used for treatment of dystonia during pregnancy are limited. Isolated case reports of treatment with trihexyphenidyl or carbidopa/levodopa for various conditions (including certain forms of dystonia) during pregnancy have not found adverse effects on either the affected mother or the fetus [Watanabe et al 2009, Mendhekar & Andrade 2011, Robottom & Reich 2011, Serikawa et al 2011, Watanabe & Matsubara 2012, Dostal et al 2013].

No adverse fetal or maternal outcomes were reported in two series of women, including four women with DYT1 dystonia, who were treated with DBS implantation prior to pregnancy. [Scelzo et al 2015, Ziman et al 2016].
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic relatives at risk in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from behavioral measures and avoidance of caffeine intake. If the pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

No published literature addresses management of the pregnancy of an affected mother or the effect of maternal EA1 on a fetus. However, affected women should be made aware that pregnancy may trigger attacks [Graves et al 2014] and the possible loss of balance and fall could endanger the fetus’s life. Moreover, several stressors that trigger attacks may cause breathing difficulties, thus, delivery by C-section should be considered.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

There is limited published literature addressing the management of the pregnancy of an affected woman or the effect of maternal EA2 on a fetus. However, because physical exertion can trigger attacks, it would be prudent for a pregnant woman to be followed closely by her obstetrician and at term to undergo a trial of labor with the intent to proceed to delivery by C-section should the labor trigger an EA2 attack [Spacey 2012].
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Cesarean section is recommended by some obstetricians to reduce trauma to the skin of an affected fetus during delivery.
Evaluating an at-risk newborn for evidence of blistering is appropriate so that trauma to the skin can be avoided as much as possible.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Presymptomatic testing of at-risk relatives is not indicated because no preventive measures or therapeutic interventions to reduce morbidity are available

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Women affected by EDM4/rMED may suffer from chronic joint pain which may be increased during pregnancy due to maternal weight gain. Appropriate pain management should be offered and physical therapy should be intensified.
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic at-risk sibs, parents, and relatives of individuals with EDMD because of the high risk for cardiac complications (including sudden death) associated with LMNA, EMD, and FLH1 pathogenic variants. Evaluation may allow early identification of family members who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures [Manilal et al 1998, Bécane et al 2000, Canki-Klain et al 2000, Vytopil et al 2002, Boriani et al 2003, Taylor et al 2003, Gueneau et al 2009, Knoblauch et al 2010, Jimenez-Escrig et al 2012]. Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the LMNA, EMD, or FHL1 pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known;

Cardiac evaluation if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

In a woman with EDMD, pregnancy complications may include the development of cardiomyopathy or progression of preexisting cardiomyopathy, preterm delivery, respiratory involvement, cephalopelvic disproportion, and delivery of a low birth-weight infant. Pregnancy management is challenging, with very limited literature addressing the issue. Caesarean section delivery may be required. Referral of an affected pregnant woman to a specialized obstetric unit in close collaboration with a cardiologist is recommended for optimal pregnancy outcome.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes

Pregnancy Management

Because of the increased risk of skin lacerations, postpartum hemorrhages, and prolapse of the uterus and/or bladder, monitoring of women throughout pregnancy and in the postpartum period is recommended.

Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) may reduce easy bruising (see Prevention of Primary Manifestations). In general, a dose of two grams per day is recommended for adults; however, no strict guidelines exist regarding recommended dose during the third trimester of pregnancy.

Monitoring of pregnant women for preterm labor is warranted during the third trimester when the risk of premature rupture of the membranes is increased.
All first-degree relatives are at a 50% risk of having EDS, hypermobility type, and may wish to undergo formal clinical assessment. Those without significant clinical manifestations may not benefit directly from knowing that they are affected, but may benefit from knowing that their children are at risk. Evaluation of children under age ten years (and especially under age 5 years) is difficult because of the normal joint laxity in that age group.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Labor and delivery may progress very rapidly. Even in primigravid women, any perception of labor should be taken seriously and she should promptly report to her intended place of delivery.

There is no clear advantage to vaginal vs. cesarean delivery. Cesarean delivery may reduce the risk of hip dislocation [Volkov et al 2007, Dutta et al 2011], but carries the same risk for surgical complications as in the general population.

There is no increase in risk for cervical incompetence, and no evidence to support use of prophylactic cerclage [Volkov et al 2007].

Pregnant women with known aortic dilation should have an echocardiogram in each trimester. Echocardiography is not needed if the aortic root is normal prior to pregnancy.
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who could benefit from surveillance, awareness of treatment for potential complications, and appropriate restriction of high-impact sports. Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant in the family is known;

Clinical evaluation and physical examination if the pathogenic variant in the family is not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

It is prudent to follow pregnant women with vEDS in a high-risk obstetrical program.

It is not known if elective caesarian section or pre-term delivery decreases the risk of mortality.

Educating the pregnant woman as to possible complications and the need for close monitoring is recommended.

Experience with use of assisted reproductive technologies for women with vEDS is limited [Bergeron et al 2014].
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Affected pregnant women may be at increased risk for spontaneous abortions, premature rupture of membranes, and rupture of arteries [Esaka et al 2009]. Two affected women had a total of seven pregnancies resulting in three miscarriages and four healthy children, three of whom were born vaginally at term and one of whom was born at 24 weeks; there were no maternal complications [Steinmann, unpublished]. Delivery should be performed in a medical center.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

No experience with pregnancy in an affected proband has been reported.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to perform laboratory evaluation of the phenotype (CBC and reticulocyte count, blood smear, osmotic fragility or ektacytometry) and clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of an affected individual by molecular genetic testing of the EPB42 pathogenic variants in the family in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

Neonates require monitoring of serum bilirubin concentration during the first week of life so that treatment for hyperbilirubinemia can be instituted promptly to avoid complications such as kernicterus.

Infants require monitoring in the first two to four months of life for significant anemia, which may require RBC transfusion and initiation of folate supplementation

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Folic acid supplementation (800-1000 µg daily) is necessary in pregnant women with chronic hemolytic anemias such as EPB42-HS.

Monitoring for exacerbation of anemia with CBC and reticulocyte count is recommended in pregnant women with HS, as hemolytic crisis and persistent anemia have been reported during pregnancy, especially in women who have not undergone splenectomy [Pajor et al 1993].
It is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from institution of treatment and preventive measures. If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate at-risk family members as newborns or infants in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early intervention (sun protection) and future monitoring for signs of liver dysfunction.

Evaluations can include the following:

Molecular genetic testing if both FECH pathogenic variants in the family are known

Biochemical testing to detect markedly increased free erythrocyte protoporphyrin if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy is not complicated by EPP. There may be some improvement in photosensitivity during pregnancy as well as a reduction in protoporphyrin levels [Poh-Fitzpatrick 1997, Heerfordt & Wulf 2016].
If the ALAS2 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, at-risk relatives can be tested as newborns or infants so that those with the pathogenic variant can benefit from early intervention (sun protection) and future monitoring for signs of liver dysfunction.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

There is no information on pregnancy management in XLP. Based on experience with EPP pregnancy is unlikely to be complicated by XLP [Poh-Fitzpatrick 1997].
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Potential teratogenic effects of medications given for treatment of erythromelalgia should be discussed with affected women of childbearing age. The ideal time to discuss this is prior to conception.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Presymptomatic testing is not warranted because the clinical diagnosis is evident at an early age and because no precipitants, protective strategies, or specific nonsurgical interventions are known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate all sibs of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from appropriate monitoring for physical abnormalities, bone marrow failure, and related cancers.

DEB/MMC testing can be used to clarify the disease status of at-risk sibs.

If the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy is possible in females with FA, whether or not they have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [Dalle et al 2004, Nabhan et al 2010].

Pregnancy needs to be managed by a high-risk maternal fetal obstetrician along with a hematologist.
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk male and female relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment (ERT) and preventive measures.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant in the family is known.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known:

Males. Measure α-Gal A enzyme activity.

Females. Measurement of α-Gal A enzyme activity is unreliable in females although demonstration of decreased α-Gal A enzyme activity is diagnostic of the heterozygous state. Ophthalmologic examination for the characteristic whorl-like corneal opacities by slit-lamp microscopy can be considered if enzyme analysis is uninformative. However, only 80%-90% of heterozygous females have the corneal lesions.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
The genetic status of asymptomatic at-risk family members can be established using molecular genetic testing; however, the indications for family testing are unresolved. In the absence of evidence that early diagnosis of factor V Leiden reduces morbidity or mortality, decisions regarding testing should be made on an individual basis.

Clarification of factor V Leiden allele status may be useful in women considering hormonal contraception or pregnancy or in families with a strong history of recurrent venous thrombosis at a young age.

Asymptomatic factor V Leiden heterozygotes and homozygotes should be aware of the signs and symptoms of venous thromboembolism that require immediate medical attention and the potential need for prophylactic anticoagulation in high-risk circumstances. They should be informed that although a factor V allele is an established risk factor, it does not predict thrombosis with certainty because the clinical course is variable, even within the same family.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Recommended genetic testing for at-risk family members. Early recognition of APC-associated polyposis conditions may allow for timely intervention and improved final outcome; thus, surveillance of asymptomatic at-risk children for early manifestations is appropriate; see Syngal et al [2015] (full text), NCCN [2016].

Use of molecular genetic testing for early identification of at-risk family members (see Genetic Counseling) improves diagnostic certainty and reduces the need for costly screening procedures in those at-risk family members who have not inherited the pathogenic variant. A cost analysis comparing molecular genetic testing and sigmoidoscopy screening for individuals at risk for APC-associated polyposis conditions shows that genetic testing is more cost effective than sigmoidoscopy in determining who in the family is affected [Cromwell et al 1998]. Additionally, individuals diagnosed with APC-associated polyposis conditions as a result of having an affected relative have a significantly greater life expectancy than those individuals diagnosed on the basis of symptoms [Heiskanen et al 2000].

As colon screening for those at risk for FAP begins as early as age ten to 12 years, molecular genetic testing is generally offered to children at risk for FAP by age ten years. Genetic testing at birth may also be warranted, as some parents and pediatricians may consider hepatoblastoma screening from infancy to age five years in affected offspring. Colon screening for those with attenuated FAP begins in late teenage years; thus, molecular genetic testing may be delayed until that time.

Note: No evidence points to an optimal age at which to begin screening; thus, the ages at which testing is performed and screening initiated may vary by center, family history, hepatoblastoma screening, and/or the needs of the parents and/or child.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy/fertility/hormone use. Limited information is available on the effect of pregnancy on females with FAP. In one study of 58 Danish women with FAP including 16 who had undergone colonic surgery, the same frequency of fertility, pregnancy, and delivery was observed as in a control population [Johansen et al 1990]. A larger study of 162 women with FAP compared fertility rates before and after two types of colorectal surgery with a control population. Women with FAP who had not yet undergone surgery had the same fertility as a control population of normal women. Additionally, those women with FAP who had a colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA) had the same fertility as the control population. Fertility was significantly reduced in women with FAP who had a proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) compared to the control population [Olsen et al 2003].

In another study, the prevalence of self-reported fertility problems was similar among individuals with FAP who had undergone IRA, IPAA, or proctocolectomy with ileostomy [Nieuwenhuis et al 2010]. However, those who had their first surgical procedure at a younger age had more postoperative fertility problems [Nieuwenhuis et al 2010].

Little evidence supports an association between desmoid tumor development or growth and pregnancy [Sinha et al 2011].

Women who have undergone colectomy are considered to be at the same risk for obstetric complications as any other woman who has had major abdominal surgery and are more likely to be delivered by C-section than those without such surgery.

As anti-estrogen medications have been successfully used in the treatment of desmoid tumors, the development of desmoid tumors is thought to be affected by hormones important in pregnancy. However, one study has shown that women who had a previous pregnancy and developed a desmoid tumor had significantly fewer complications from the desmoid tumor than those who had never had a pregnancy [Church & McGannon 2000].

In a study of women with FAP at the time of their colectomy, no association was found between pregnancy history and colonic polyp severity; however, the proportion of parous women with severe duodenal disease was significantly higher than the proportion of nulliparous women [Suraweera et al 2007].

Some studies have suggested that female hormones protect against colorectal cancer development in the general population. In one woman, reduction in polyps after use of oral contraceptives was observed [Giardiello et al 2005].

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancies in women with FD are considered high risk because of abrupt changes in blood pressure.

High blood pressure secondary to FD is difficult to differentiate from toxemia or other causes of pregnancy-related high blood pressure.

Awareness of volume loss and low blood pressure is important because of the absence of reflex tachycardia to low blood pressure.

Visceral pain related to contractions during labor is perceived normally; therefor, analgesia should be provided. Epidural anesthesia is preferable due to blood pressure lability during general anesthesia or spinal block [Maayan et al 2000].
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Because of the risk for major congenital abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract, heart, and kidney, high-resolution ultrasound investigations (including fetal echocardiogram) are advised in any pregnancy in which one of the parents is known to be affected.
Relatives at risk benefit from fundus examination and, ideally, fundus fluorescein angiography to identify any characteristic lesions. Prophylaxis in the form of peripheral retinal ablation with laser photocoagulation or cryotherapy depends on the individual's age and the progression of the lesion.

If the pathogenic mutation has been identified in an affected family member, molecular genetic testing of at-risk family members may be useful: relatives who do not have the family-specific mutation do not need regular retinal examinations.

No specific pregnancy complications for the mother or the fetus have been observed in the two women with SRCAP pathogenic variants who had children with FHS.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management 

Delivery of an affected infant has the potential to be complicated by extended breech presentation due to dislocation of the hips and knees.
Molecular genetic testing should be offered to all first-degree relatives and other at-risk family members as early as possible whether or not they have symptoms. This is especially important when the p.Met694Val allele is present because other affected family members may not have inflammatory attacks, but nevertheless remain at risk for amyloidosis (FMF type 2) and thus need to be treated with colchicine (1.0 mg/day) to prevent the development of renal amyloidosis. Note: About 15% of individuals with autosomal dominant FMF develop amyloidosis and end-stage renal failure if untreated.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Ben-Chetrit et al [2010] conducted a survey to evaluate the outcome of 179 pregnancies of women taking colchicine to treat FMF. No differences were found between the treated group and the control group regarding early abortions, late abortions, or congenital malformations. Similar findings were reported by Diav-Citrin et al [2010]. Nevertheless, it is still important to discuss the option of amniocentesis for every pregnancy in mothers treated with colchicine.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

For affected women, management of pregnancy should be guided by standard obstetric principles taking into account potential complications of FDH. Skeletal abnormalities including scoliosis or diastasis pubis may be present in some affected women, and may affect delivery management. Women with significant scoliosis will benefit from evaluation of respiratory status and feasibility of epidural analgesia. Obstetricians should be aware that verrucous papillomas in genital areas in women with FDH are unlikely to be viral in origin and thus, there is no risk for transmission to the newborn during vaginal delivery.
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

Evaluations can include the following:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known. Molecular genetic testing of younger at-risk sibs who have not undergone prenatal testing should be performed immediately after birth. Those with biallelic SLC46A1 pathogenic variants should be treated with 5-formyltetrahydrofolate immediately.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known and genetic testing is not possible, assessment of blood and CSF folate levels and, if warranted, intestinal absorption of folate in at-risk sibs immediately after birth, or as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed in the proband

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

There is no systematic information on the outcome of pregnancy in women with HFM.

Although the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) is highly expressed in the placenta [Qiu et al 2006], a woman with homozygous pathogenic variants in SLC46A1 that resulted in no PCFT protein production had two normal pregnancies and delivered two healthy infants. The affected woman’s parenteral 5-formylTHF dose was increased when pregnancy was planned [Poncz et al 1981; Poncz & Cohen 1996; Min et al 2008; Goldman, personal communication to Author].

Women with HFM who wish to become pregnant should increase their dose of 5-formylTHF intake above the maintenance dose well in advance of attempting to conceive. Prenatal vitamins are available containing 5-methylTHF rather than folic acid.

Of note, infants with HFM do not appear to be at an increased risk for malformations (e.g., neural tube defects) typically associated with maternal folate deficiency during pregnancy.
It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic sibs of an affected individual by molecular genetic testing of the FOXP2 genetic alteration in the family to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt evaluation and initiation of treatment.

Pregnancy Management

Close cardiac monitoring is recommended in any woman with FRDA during pregnancy.
Testing of sibs at risk for Fryns syndrome requires an evaluation for physical anomalies (see Diagnosis and Management, Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis). If chromosome studies were not obtained on the proband, CMA to evaluate for the possibility of a chromosome disorder (see Differential Diagnosis) could be performed in the sib(s) at risk. A high index of suspicion for a chromosome aberration should prompt evaluation for deletions of the chromosomal loci associated with a Fryns syndrome-like phenotype.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancies are managed according to the malformations that have been diagnosed. One literature review concluded that fetoscopic endoluminal tracheal occlusion (FETO) used as a prenatal interventional strategy can increase survival in cases with severe CDH [Cundy et al 2014], although this technique has most frequently been used for isolated CDH rather than Fryns syndrome.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Outcome of 105 pregnancies in 38 women with FSHD was generally favorable [Ciafaloni et al 2006]. However, rates for low birth-weight infants, augmented extraction procedures such as forceps and vacuum assisted deliveries, delivery by Cesarean section, and anesthetic complications were higher than for the general population. Worsening of weakness occurred in 24% of the pregnancies, beginning during the pregnancy and generally not resolving after delivery.

Pregnancy Management 

Pregnancy needs to be managed by a high-risk maternal fetal obstetrician.

Bisphosphonates have been tried antenatally, with both unsuccessful [Stuart 1993] and successful results [Michael A Levine, personal communication].
When the pathogenic variants causing classic galactosemia or clinical variant galactosemia in the family are known, prenatal diagnosis of fetuses at risk may be performed via amniocentesis or CVS to allow for institution of treatment at birth.

If prenatal testing has not been performed, each at-risk newborn sib should be treated from birth and screened for classic galactosemia or clinical variant galactosemia using the erythrocyte GALT enzyme assay and/or genetic testing (if the familial pathogenic variants in the family are known) to allow for earliest possible diagnosis. Note: If there are concerns about the reliability of the prenatal testing, soy-based formula may be given while the diagnostic testing is being performed.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Both women with classic galactosemia and with clinical variant galactosemia should be on a lactose restricted diet during pregnancy.

There is no evidence that the outcome of children with classic galactosemia or clinical variant galactosemia is improved when their mothers (who are obligate carriers) were on a lactose-restricted diet during pregnancy. Therefore, unaffected pregnant women who are heterozygous for a pathogenic variant in GALT (carrier females) do NOT require a lactose-restricted diet during pregnancy.
If prenatal testing has not been performed (see Genetic Counseling), each at-risk newborn sib should be treated from birth until results of diagnostic testing are available. Diagnostic evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known;

Measurement of GALE enzyme activity in red blood cells if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known. Note: If there are concerns about the reliability of the prenatal testing, soy-based formula may be given while the diagnostic testing is being performed.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing for the familial GATA1 pathogenic variant;

A screening complete blood count to evaluate for thrombocytopenia, anemia, or neutropenia.

Note: Platelet, erythrocyte, and neutrophil counts can vary significantly in individuals with GATA1 pathogenic variants; normal results do not rule out the possibility that the relative has a GATA1 pathogenic variant.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to offer testing to asymptomatic at-risk relatives so that those with glucocerebrosidase enzyme deficiency or two disease-causing alleles can benefit from early diagnosis and treatment to reduce morbidity.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy may affect the course of GD both by exacerbating preexisting symptoms and by triggering new features such as bone pain. Women with severe thrombocytopenia and/or clotting abnormalities may have an increased risk of bleeding around the time of delivery [Elstein et al 2004b].
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

In addition to the considerations described in Genetic Counseling, other pregnancy-related considerations include the following:

Risk of major malformations (especially due to valproic acid exposure in utero [Samrén et al 1997]) and minor anomalies

Advantages and disadvantages of increasing maternal periconceptional folic acid supplementation to 4000 µg daily, particularly when women are taking valproic acid or carbamazepine during pregnancy

Effect of in utero exposure to anticonvulsants on future cognitive development [Meador et al 2009]

Effect of anticonvulsants on hormonal methods of birth control

Effects of anticonvulsants on conception; the risk for complications in mothers who are on anticonvulsants

Effect of pregnancy on anticonvulsant metabolism

Effect of pregnancy on maternal seizure control

Pregnancy, family planning, and contraception are issues that should be raised with every female near childbearing age who has epilepsy. These considerations are not unique to or (aside from medication selection) significantly influenced by the presence of an SCN1A-related seizure disorder.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Testing at-risk sibs in the neonatal period may be helpful in establishing the diagnosis of PCG early and in avoiding repeated examinations under anesthesia in at-risk young children.

Molecular genetic testing alone is appropriate in sibs of affected individuals in whom the pathogenic variant(s) have been identified.

If the PCG-related pathogenic variant(s) have not been identified in an affected family member (i.e., no definitive exclusion of the disease is possible by molecular genetic testing), screening including IOP measurements under anesthesia/sedation may be necessary.

Note: The literature is unclear as to timing of the onset of glaucoma, especially in families in whom pathogenic variants have been identified. In this high-risk group, it may be appropriate to perform yearly glaucoma screening into young adulthood.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate at-risk newborns, infants, and other relatives at risk in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures. Molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives if the pathogenic variant in the family is known.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnant women must be monitored medically, taking into account any preexisting conditions including congenital heart disease, scoliosis, and asthma. Additional surveillance should include calcium, thyroid, and platelet levels. In addition, changes in mental status/behavior should be referred for immediate evaluation by a mental health care provider.

A fetus at high risk of having the condition should undergo a level II ultrasound with fetal echocardiogram to evaluate for the following anomalies : congenital heart disease; airway, palate, swallowing, and gastrointestinal differences possibly leading to polyhydramnios (congenital diaphragmatic hernia, tracheoesophageal fistula, subglottic stenosis, vascular ring, laryngeal web, and cleft palate/cleft lip/palate); renal anomalies; skeletal differences such as club foot and craniosynostosis; and umbilical and inguinal hernia.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Early diagnosis of at-risk sibs allows for early orthopedic evaluation and measures to control the development of arthritis.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Management of pregnancy for affected women is identical to that for women with other forms of dwarfism or small stature, which is mainly to reduce the risk of premature birth.

When a fetus is diagnosed prenatally (usually as the result of molecular genetic testing of an at-risk sib), no special surveillance during the pregnancy is warranted and no special issues regarding delivery have been identified.
Using molecular genetic testing for the GRIN2A pathogenic variant found in an affected family member, it is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic at-risk relatives in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from institution of treatment. Of note, some individuals heterozygous for a GRIN2A pathogenic variant who have only relatively mild speech dysfunction may benefit from early evaluation and intervention by a speech and language pathologist.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Evaluation of sibs of a proband as early as possible allows for prompt diagnosis and treatment with much-improved outcome. Evaluations include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known;

Evaluation by a metabolic physician soon after birth for symptoms pertaining to GSDI if the family-specific pathogenic variants are not known or if molecular genetic testing is not available.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Although successful pregnancies have been reported in women with GSDI, certain precautions should be taken:

Pre-pregnancy counseling regarding diet to avoid low blood glucose and to stress the importance of blood glucose monitoring prior to and during pregnancy

Baseline ultrasound of liver and kidneys prior to pregnancy

Consideration of referral to high-risk obstetrician

Review of medications prior to conception to weigh risks and benefits:

Exposure to ACE inhibitors in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can cause fetal damage and death.

No data on the use of allopurinol during pregnancy in humans exist; however, high doses have been shown to interfere with embryo development in animal models.

Lipid-lowering drugs may also lead to adverse fetal effects and should be avoided during pregnancy.

Metabolic control should be followed closely throughout the pregnancy. Because carbohydrate requirements may increase with pregnancy, glucose levels should be monitored closely and treated accordingly [Martens et al 2008, Dagli et al 2010, Yamamoto et al 2010, Ferrecchia et al 2014].

Abdominal ultrasound should be performed every six to 12 weeks. Sechi et al [2013] reported an increase in the size of pre-existent adenomas and the development of new adenomas during pregnancy and recommended monitoring by imaging before, during, and after pregnancy. Resection of large (≥5 cm) or growing adenomas before pregnancy has been recommended [Terkivatan et al 2000].

Renal function should be followed closely, as this may worsen during pregnancy [Martens et al 2008, Dagli et al 2010, Yamamoto et al 2010]. Development of renal calculi has been reported in pregnant women with GSDIb [Dagli et al 2010].

Glucose infusion during labor has been used [Martens et al 2008, Dagli et al 2010, Ferrecchia et al 2014].

Platelet count, hemoglobin, and clotting studies should be performed because of the potential for increased bleeding at delivery [Lewis et al 2005].
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic sibs of a proband so that morbidity and mortality can be reduced by early diagnosis and treatment with ERT.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the GAA pathogenic variants in the family are known.

Testing of GAA enzyme activity if the GAA pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Most individuals with infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) have not reproduced.

Many adults with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) have reproduced. At least one woman treated with ERT during pregnancy and lactation with no adverse effects on the fetus has been reported [de Vries et al 2011]. As would be expected in a woman with a myopathy and respiratory insufficiency, the growing fetus may pose additional complications to the mother’s health. Close respiratory and cardiac surveillance should be initiated in consultation with maternal fetal medicine specialists.
Diagnosis of at-risk sibs at birth allows for early dietary intervention to prevent development of hypoglycemia associated with GSD III.

If the AGL pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing is the best way to determine the genetic status of an at-risk sib.

If the AGL pathogenic variants in the family are not known, diagnosis can be established by presence of fasting ketotic hypoglycemia.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Increased monitoring and support are required in pregnancy of women with GSD III as glucose needs will increase. The metabolic requirements will gradually increase throughout the second and third trimesters, and close monitoring of both glucose and ketones is critical to ensure optimal metabolic control. In the third trimester and close to term, it is imperative to maintain ketones within normal levels as ketosis can precipitate uterine contractions and preterm labor. During labor and in the postnatal period, intravenous glucose supplementation must be available at all times to prevent hypoglycemic episodes.
If the GBE1 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, at-risk relatives can be tested so that those with the pathogenic variants can be evaluated for involvement of the liver, skeletal muscle, and heart to allow early diagnosis and management of disease manifestations.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Early diagnosis of GSDV in relatives at risk may improve long-term outcome by heightening awareness of the need to avoid repetitive episodes of muscle damage that may lead to rhabdomyolysis and fixed weakness.

When the family-specific PYGM pathogenic variants are known, molecular genetic testing can be used.

When the family-specific PYGM pathogenic variants are not known, a reliable and accurate diagnosis of GSDV could be reached following the criteria described in Diagnosis.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management 

The condition does not appear to adversely affect pregnancy and childbirth outcomes [Quinlivan et al 2010, Lucia et al 2012].
If the family-specific pathogenic variants are known it is appropriate to offer molecular genetic testing to at-risk sibs so that early diagnosis can lead to early treatment and avoidance of factors that exacerbate disease.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Although clinical and biochemical abnormalities usually resolve with age and most adults are asymptomatic, hypoglycemia can occur during pregnancy.
Molecular genetic testing (if the family-specific variants are known) and/or evaluation by a metabolic physician during the first year of life (if the family-specific variants are not known) allows for early diagnosis and treatment for sibs at increased risk for liver PhK deficiency.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Ideally, women with PhK deficiency consult with their health care team and maintain optimal metabolic control before conception.

It is extremely important that euglycemia is maintained throughout pregnancy to avoid upregulation of counterregulatory hormones which would result in lipolysis and ketosis, with risk of fetal demise. The appropriate diet during pregnancy is unique to each individual. For some, this may only require following a regular healthy diet, but for many it may mean increasing snacks to include more complex carbohydrates and protein and/or adding or increasing the amount of corn starch. Blood glucose concentrations and ketones should also be measured during pregnancy on a regular basis to ensure euglycemia. Adequate amounts of protein are necessary to provide an alternate source of glucose via gluconeogenesis.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk for HCP in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from education regarding the risk factors associated with acute attacks.

If the CPOX pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

If the CPOX pathogenic variant in the family is not known, a first-degree relative with symptoms can be evaluated with biochemical tests (see Diagnosis). Note: Although some CPOX heterozygotes have a diagnostic biochemical profile of heme precursors in urine and feces (see Table 1, ‘Active’ columns), many have normal findings (see Table 1, ‘Asymptomatic’ columns) and can only be diagnosed by molecular genetic testing.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

The effect of pregnancy on inducing acute attacks is unpredictable. In general, serious problems during pregnancy are unusual. In fact, some women with recurrent symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle report improvement during pregnancy. Attacks, if they occur, are usually in the first trimester. The women most at risk are those with hyperemesis gravidarum and inadequate caloric intake [Aggarwal et al 2002]. Among antiemetics, ondansetron is not expected to precipitate or exacerbate acute attacks or to increase the risk for congenital anomalies in the fetus; however, metoclopramide should be avoided, as it may precipitate acute attacks [Shenhav et al 1997].

The experience with administration of hematin (or heme arginate, which is not available in the US) during pregnancy is limited. Badminton & Deybach [2006] published an anecdotal report of successful heme arginate treatment (without adverse fetal effect) in several women experiencing attacks of variegate porphyria or other acute porphyrias during pregnancy. Based on the absence of reported adverse effects, use of hematin to control exacerbations of acute intermittent porphyria during pregnancy has been recommended [Isenschmid et al 1992, Farfaras et al 2010].
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management 

There is no specific information available about disease management during pregnancy. Prudence suggests close attention to prevention of falls and monitoring for swallowing difficulties. Medications should be reviewed to assess their safety during pregnancy.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Identification of at-risk relatives. A thorough family history may identify other relatives who are at risk but have not been tested (particularly in families with mild hemophilia A).

Early determination of the genetic status of males at risk. Either assay of factor VIII clotting activity from a cord blood sample obtained by venipuncture of the umbilical vein (to avoid contamination by amniotic fluid or placenta tissue) or molecular genetic testing for the family-specific F8 pathogenic variant can establish or exclude the diagnosis of hemophilia A in newborn males at risk. Infants with a family history of hemophilia A should not be circumcised unless hemophilia A is either excluded or, if present, factor VIII concentrate is administered immediately before and after the procedure to prevent delayed oozing and poor wound healing.

Note: Ideally, the cord blood for factor VIII clotting activity assay should be drawn into a syringe containing one-tenth volume of sodium citrate to avoid clotting and to provide an optimal mixing of the sample with the anticoagulant. If not available a standard blue top tube can be used.

Determination of genetic status of females at risk. Approximately 30% of heterozygous females have factor VIII activity lower than 40% and may have abnormal bleeding. In a survey of Dutch heterozygous females, bleeding symptoms correlated with baseline factor clotting activity; there was suggestion of a very mild increase in bleeding even in those with 40% to 60% factor VIII activity [Plug et al 2006]. Therefore, all daughters and mothers of an affected male and other at-risk females should have a baseline factor VIII clotting activity assay to determine if they are at increased risk for bleeding (unless they are known to be non-carriers based on molecular genetic testing). Very occasionally, a female will have particularly low factor VIII clotting activity that may result from heterozygosity for an F8 pathogenic variant associated with skewed X-chromosome inactivation or, on rare occasion, compound heterozygosity for two F8 pathogenic variants [Pavlova et al 2009].

It is recommended that the carrier status of a female at risk be established prior to pregnancy or as early in a pregnancy as possible.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Obstetric issues. It is recommended that the carrier status of a female at risk be established prior to pregnancy or as early in a pregnancy as possible.

If the female is symptomatic (i.e., has baseline factor VIII clotting activity <40%), she will be somewhat protected by the natural rise of factor VIII clotting activity during pregnancy, which may even double by the end of the third trimester. The factor VIII level should be measured in the third trimester to confirm that the level is in the normal range, and if it is not, a plan for factor replacement therapy should be developed. Postpartum factor VIII clotting activity can return to baseline within 48 hours, and postpartum hemorrhage may ensue [Lee et al 2006].

Newborn males. Controversy remains as to indications for cesarean section versus vaginal delivery [James & Hoots 2010, Chalmers et al 2011]. In retrospective data analysis of 580 males age 0-2 years with hemophilia, 17 suffered intracranial hemorrhages with delivery, and all but one were delivered vaginally [Kulkarni et al 2009]. This finding supports the recommendation of cesarean section for hemophilic infants, however, 12 of the 17 were born to women not known to be carriers, suggesting that a planned delivery may mitigate risks. In anticipation of delivery, the relative risks of cesarean section versus vaginal delivery should be considered and discussed with the family and obstetrician in anticipation of delivery so that a coordinated plan can be developed.
Identification of at-risk relatives. A thorough family history may identify other male relatives who are at risk but have not been tested (particularly in families with mild hemophilia B).

Early determination of the genetic status of males at risk. Either assay of factor IX clotting activity from a cord blood sample obtained by venipuncture of the umbilical vein (to avoid contamination by amniotic fluid or placenta tissue) or molecular genetic testing for the family-specific F9 pathogenic variant can establish or exclude the diagnosis of hemophilia B in newborn males at risk. Infants with a family history of hemophilia B should not be circumcised unless hemophilia B is either excluded or, if present, factor IX concentrate is administered immediately before and after the procedure to prevent delayed oozing and poor wound healing.

Note: (1) The cord blood for factor IX clotting activity assay should be drawn into a syringe containing one-tenth volume of sodium citrate to avoid clotting and to provide an optimal mixing of the sample with the anticoagulant. (2) Factor IX clotting activity in cord blood in a normal-term newborn is lower than in adults (mean: ~30%; range: 15%-50%); thus, the diagnosis of hemophilia B can be established in an infant with activity lower than 1%, but is equivocal in an infant with moderately low (15%-20%) activity.

Determination of genetic status of females at risk. Approximately 30% of heterozygous females have factor IX clotting activity lower than 40% and may have abnormal bleeding. In a recent Dutch survey of heterozygous females, bleeding symptoms correlated with baseline factor clotting activity; there was suggestion of a very mild increase in bleeding even in those with 40% to 60% factor IX clotting activity [Plug et al 2006]. Joint range of motion in female carriers with factor VIII or factor IX activity lower than 40% was found to be significantly different from that measured in normal controls and inversely related to factor level [Sidonio et al 2014]. All daughters and mothers of an affected male and other at-risk females should have a baseline factor IX clotting activity assay to determine if they are at increased risk for bleeding (unless they are known to be non-carriers based on molecular genetic testing). Very occasionally, a female will have particularly low factor IX clotting activity that may result from heterozygosity for an F9 pathogenic variant associated with skewed X-chromosome inactivation or, on rare occasion, compound heterozygosity for two F9 pathogenic variants.

It is recommended that the carrier status of a female at risk be established prior to pregnancy or as early in a pregnancy as possible.

Pregnancy Management

Obstetric issues. It is recommended that the carrier status of a female at risk be established prior to pregnancy or as early in a pregnancy as possible.

Unlike for factor VIII (FVIII), maternal factor IX levels do not increase during pregnancy and carriers are more likely to need factor infusion support for delivery or to treat or prevent postpartum hemorrhage. In carriers, postpartum hemorrhage has been a prominent feature, despite the absence of heavy menstrual bleeding [Yang & Ragni 2004].

If the female has a baseline factor IX clotting activity below approximately 40%, she by definition has hemophilia and is at risk for excessive bleeding, particularly post partum, and may require therapy with factor IX concentrate [Yang & Ragni 2004].

Newborn males. Controversy remains as to indications for cesarean section versus vaginal delivery [James & Hoots 2010, Ljung 2010]. For elective deliveries, the relative risks of cesarean section versus vaginal delivery should be considered, especially if a male has been diagnosed with severe hemophilia B prenatally.

At birth or in the early neonatal period, intracranial hemorrhage is uncommon (<1%-2%), even in males with severe hemophilia B who are delivered vaginally.
It is appropriate to clarify the status of apparently asymptomatic adult sibs and offspring of individuals homozygous for p.Cys282Tyr in order to identify those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

The following strategy is appropriate:

Offer molecular genetic testing to the adult sibs of an individual homozygous for p.Cys282Tyr.

Perform iron studies (i.e., transferrin iron saturation and serum concentration of ferritin) on those sibs who are homozygous for p.Cys282Tyr.

Begin phlebotomy therapy if serum ferritin concentration is elevated above the upper limits of normal and if the proband has clinical HFE-HH. Note: Sibs of probands with clinical HFE-HH appear to have a higher prevalence of clinical HFE-HH than asymptomatic individuals detected through screening programs.

Note: Genotype-based testing has been found to be cost effective in most individuals because it has excellent negative predictive value. However, genotype-based testing has a low positive predictive value because many p.Cys282Tyr homozygotes and compound heterozygotes will not express the disease [El-Serag et al 2000, Beutler et al 2002].

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

No guidelines exist; common practice is to withhold phlebotomy during pregnancy.
If the family-specific UROD pathogenic variants are known, it is reasonable to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives so that those with biallelic UROD pathogenic variants can be counseled regarding sun protection and avoidance of known susceptibility factors.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Physical examination of relatives and HOXA13 sequence analysis will help identify those at risk of genitourinary and reproductive tract complications.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

In women with HFGS, premature pregnancy loss is possible secondary to uterine malformation. Consultation with an obstetrician before pregnancy is recommended and should include evaluation for and discussion of potential pregnancy complications. Affected fetuses are generally healthy, but could be at risk for premature birth secondary to maternal uterine malformation if the mother is also affected.
It may be appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs in order to identify individuals who would benefit from fructose restriction (see Prevention of Primary Manifestations). If the ALDOB pathogenic variants in the family are known, targeted molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk family members.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Few reports exist relating to management of pregnant women with HFI or pregnancy-related complications in HFI. In general, in familial reports in which pregnancies are not expressly discussed, it appears that HFI in a pregnant mother does not cause harm to the mother or the child provided that strict fructose avoidance is followed during the pregnancy.

In one family a woman with enzymatically documented HFI had three children (presumably from the same father), all of whom also had HFI [Marks et al 1989]. Most complications observed in these children seem to have resulted from their own poorly controlled HFI or comorbidities in early childhood, rather than maternal effects of HFI per se. The first child developed failure to thrive and cirrhosis and died at age six months of E. coli sepsis and pulmonary edema. The second child, who had HFI complicated by transfusion-acquired HIV infection, died at age five years from complications of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In her third pregnancy, which proceeded normally, the mother was maintained on a strict fructose-restricted diet. The child also had HFI but thrived on a fructose-restricted diet.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to offer molecular genetic testing to at-risk relatives if the CDH1 pathogenic variant is identified in an affected family member, so that morbidity and mortality can be reduced by early diagnosis and treatment. See Genetic Counseling, Testing of asymptomatic at-risk individuals younger than age 18 years for discussion of issues related to testing of this population.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Testing of Populations at Risk

In Japan, where the prevalence of gastric cancer is high, a mass population screening program allows for successful detection of early disease by endoscopy [Shiratori et al 1985]. In this program, all suspicious findings seen on endoscopy are biopsied and evaluated histologically. Suspicious findings include minute changes in the color of the mucosa, altered vascular pattern, roughened surface, flat lesions, and minor mucosal irregularities.

Pregnancy Management

Evidence shows that pregnancy after PTG can have healthy and normal outcomes. Kaurah et al [2010] discussed six healthy pregnancies and infants born to four women after total gastrectomy. However, it is important that women who have undergone PTG and are pregnant be followed closely by their physician and a dietician who is aware of the situation.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
If the pathogenic variants in a family are known, use molecular genetic testing to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives to allow for early diagnosis and treatment, perhaps even before symptoms occur. Note: Plasma concentrations of ornithine and urinary excretion of orotic acid and homocitrulline may be unreliable in asymptomatic persons.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy in a woman with HHH syndrome has not been published. Rebecca Mardach, MD (Kaiser Permanente, Los Angeles) provided information to the authors about a healthy boy born after an uneventful pregnancy to a clinically asymptomatic woman in her early 20s who had been diagnosed with HHH syndrome at age 13 years in the course of evaluation of her affected five-year-old sib [Camacho et al 2006]. During her pregnancy the mother was maintained on a protein and citrulline regimen that allowed normal fetal development and maternal health; plasma and urine amino acids, orotic acid, plasma ammonia, and urine organic acids were monitored.

There are no well-controlled epidemiologic studies of the fetal effects of sodium benzoate, phenylacetate, or phenylbutyrate during human pregnancy. However, sodium benzoate has been reported to lead to malformations and neurotoxicity/nephrotoxicity in zebrafish larvae [Tsay et al 2007] and to possible teratogenicity in rats [Minor & Becker 1971, Onodera et al 1978]. As a known differentiating agent, sodium phenylbutyrate also functions as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor with potential teratogenicity given its ability to alter gene expression in fetal mice [Di Renzo et al 2007].

The FDA has assigned sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate to pregnancy category C (“potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks”). Theoretically, the use of benzoate/phenylacetate and in particular sodium phenylbutyrate should be avoided during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester. The use of these medications should be carefully evaluated for each individual (benefit/risk ratio) in consultation with a metabolic genetics specialist. Despite the report of successful administration of sodium phenybutyrate to an OTC-deficient woman throughout her 11- to 33-week gestation period, caution is advised and the alternate use of sodium benzoate, if deemed necessary, is recommended [Redonnet-Vernhet et al 2000]. Mendez-Figueroa et al [2010] reported a small number of females with OTC deficiency who successfully completed their pregnancies without need of ammonia removal medications. This study also reported the use of sodium benzoate to manage a pregnant woman with OTC deficiency who developed mild hyperammonemia during induction of labor.

No specialized care for a fetus known to have HHH syndrome is warranted.
It is appropriate to evaluate at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from preventive measures (see Prevention of Primary Manifestations) and prompt initiation of treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is known, evaluate with molecular genetic testing.

If the familial pathogenic variant is not known and, consequently, HHT cannot been ruled out by molecular diagnosis, at-risk family members should follow the same protocol as is recommended for individuals in whom the diagnosis of HHT is definite (see Surveillance).

Individuals older than age 40 years should have a targeted medical history and clinical examination for features of HHT. The absence of mild but recurrent epistaxis and subtle telangiectases in characteristic locations on careful examination is reassuring.

In individuals age 40 years and younger, targeted medical history and clinical examination for features of HHT in addition to an evaluation for brain and pulmonary AVMs should be done initially, as features of HHT may not be identified by medical history and clinical examination in younger individuals.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnant women with HHT and untreated pulmonary AVMs are also at high risk for lung hemorrhage and cerebral complications of air embolism. Women with treated pulmonary AVMs appear to be at no higher risk during pregnancy than those without pulmonary AVMs.
Molecular genetic testing is appropriate in the sibs of affected individuals to identify those with the pathogenic variants known to be present in the family so that appropriate evaluation and treatment can be initiated before hypoglycemia occurs. Because of the severe neurologic consequences of delayed diagnosis and treatment, it is imperative that at-risk individuals be tested and a definitive diagnosis be made as rapidly as possible. Once the causative pathogenic variants have been identified in a proband, it is prudent to test all at-risk relatives. Depending on the findings, more extensive family investigations may be warranted. For further discussion of prenatal diagnosis, see Prenatal Testing.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Affected individuals who previously underwent near-total or sub-total pancreatectomy typically have insulin-requiring diabetes by the time they become pregnant. In this case, treatment is the same as for individuals with preexisting diabetes from any cause. There is little, if any, experience with pregnancy in individuals who were treated conservatively or who underwent limited pancreatectomy for focal FHI, as these treatments are relatively new. In this situation, close monitoring of glucose to detect both recurrent hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia is warranted. If hyperglycemia is documented, treatment should be instituted as for any woman with gestational diabetes. A fetus at risk for FHI should be monitored for size and weight. Excessive fetal weight gain during the last trimester of pregnancy increases the risk of obstetric complications and of cesarean delivery. In pregnant women with a history of FHI and gestational hyperglycemia due to prior surgical treatment, the fetus should be monitored as for any case of preexisting type 1, preexisting type 2, or gestational diabetes.
Molecular genetic testing of at-risk relatives of a proband with a known pathogenic variant allows for early diagnosis.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Cessation of prophylactic antimicrobials is often advised during pregnancy. This may increase the risk of infection and should be taken into consideration. There have been pregnancies without complication, but also instances in which lung disease has worsened after pregnancy, potentially from limited antimicrobial options, delayed radiographic diagnosis, and impaired pulmonary clearance.

Risks associated with pregnancy should be discussed with affected females who have pulmonary compromise, severe scoliosis, or other complications of AD-HIES.
Molecular genetic testing of at-risk sibs for the family-specific pathogenic variants is appropriate to identify those who are affected before symptoms occur for the purpose of early medical management and consideration of presymptomatic bone marrow transplantation.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

To date, pregnancy in a woman with primary FHL has not been described. Secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a rare complication of pregnancy and is beyond the scope of this review. Primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in the fetus is a (reportedly) rare but recognized entity which is typically characterized by nonimmune fetal hydrops [Malloy et al 2004, Nitta et al 2007, Woods et al 2009], preterm delivery [Woods et al 2009], and/or fetal demise. In utero chemotherapy followed by post-natal HCT has been described [Shah et al 2009].
It is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing of asymptomatic at-risk relatives improves diagnostic certainty, allows early surveillance and treatment in those with the family-specific pathogenic variant, and reduces costly screening procedures in those who have not inherited the pathogenic variant.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, fumarate hydratase enzyme assay can be used to clarify the disease status of at-risk relatives. Early recognition of clinical manifestations may allow timely intervention and improve outcome. Therefore, clinical surveillance of asymptomatic at-risk relatives for early detection is appropriate.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures. Chelation therapy and iron supplementation can potentially prevent primary disease manifestations in asymptomatic individuals.

Evaluations include:

Molecular genetic testing if the SLC30A10 pathogenic variants in the family are known;

Periodic monitoring of whole-blood manganese concentration and hemoglobin if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

For an affected fetus, no prenatal treatment is recommended as the disease does not manifest before early childhood.

For an affected mother, no data or information on pregnancy management are available.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Information is insufficient to determine if particular issues in HMERF relate to pregnancy. In general, onset of symptoms occurs after the age of childbearing. However, a pregnant woman with early manifestations of HMERF or at risk for HMERF should be considered high-risk because of the associated respiratory muscle weakness, and the increased physiologic demands of pregnancy. Consultation with a high-risk maternal-fetal medicine specialist is recommended when possible.

From the point of view of the fetus the authors are unaware of any specific issues relating to HMERF, since this is an adult-onset disorder.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Women with HNA should be monitored in the post-partum interval for the development of symptoms. Prompt treatment with corticosteroids or similar agents may ameliorate an HNA attack.
Early recognition of cancers associated with Lynch syndrome may allow for timely intervention and improved final outcome; thus, surveillance of asymptomatic at-risk relatives for early manifestations is appropriate.

When an MMR pathogenic variant has been identified in a family with Lynch syndrome, molecular genetic testing for the pathogenic variant should be offered to all first-degree relatives (parents, sibs, and children).

The sibs should be considered at risk even if the parents have not had cancer because most Lynch syndrome results from an inherited (not de novo) pathogenic variant.

If clinical history and family history cannot identify the parent from whom the proband inherited the MMR gene pathogenic variant, molecular genetic testing for the pathogenic variant should be offered to both parents to determine which has the MMR gene pathogenic variant.

In general, molecular genetic testing for Lynch syndrome is not recommended for at-risk individuals younger than age 18 years. However, because cancer has been diagnosed in individuals with Lynch syndrome at very young ages [Huang et al 2001], it is recommended that screening begin ten years before the earliest age of onset in the family. In such instances, it is appropriate to offer molecular genetic testing to children younger than age 18 years prior to initiating cancer screening.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Ideally cancer screening exams would be planned around a pregnancy. An affected woman would be encouraged to be current on her cancer screening before attempting to become pregnant. If an affected woman is diagnosed with cancer during pregnancy, she should be counseled about cancer treatment options and their potential implications for the fetus.
Relatives at risk may wish to clarify their genetic status by undergoing molecular genetic testing; if found to have the PMP22 pathogenic variant identified in an affected family member, they can choose to avoid the aforementioned agents and circumstances.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Plasma concentrations of total homocysteine and amino acids should be measured in at-risk sibs as soon as possible after birth so that morbidity and mortality can be reduced by early diagnosis and treatment.

If the CBS pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of sibs.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Because women with homocystinuria may be at greater than average risk for thromboembolism, especially post partum, prophylactic anticoagulation during the third trimester of pregnancy and post partum is recommended. The usual regimen is injection of low molecular-weight heparin during the last two weeks of pregnancy and the first six weeks post partum [Pierre et al 2006]. Aspirin in low doses has also been given throughout pregnancy.

Maternal homocystinuria, unlike maternal phenylketonuria (see Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Deficiency), does not appear to have major teratogenic potential requiring additional counseling or, with respect to the fetus, more stringent management [Levy et al 2002, Vilaseca et al 2004]. Nevertheless, treatment with pyridoxine or methionine-restricted diet or both should be continued during pregnancy [Morris et al 2017]. Betaine may also be continued and appears not to be teratogenic [Yap et al 2001b, Levy et al 2002, Vilaseca et al 2004, Pierre et al 2006].
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from appropriate cardiac management. Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the TBX5 pathogenic variant in the family is known;

Echocardiography, ECG, and hand x-rays (anterior/posterior view) if the pathogenic variant in the family is not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnant women with HOS who have a known history of a structural cardiac defect or cardiac conduction abnormality should be followed by a multidisciplinary team (including a cardiologist) during pregnancy. Affected women who have not undergone cardiac evaluation should do so prior to pregnancy if possible, or as soon as the pregnancy is recognized.
A careful family history by a clinical geneticist familiar with HPE is critical, as genetic changes associated with HPE, even in a mildly affected individual, would be considered a risk factor for manifestations such as developmental delay.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
When a pathogenic variant is identified in a proband, molecular genetic testing of at-risk, asymptomatic family members is appropriate because of the risk for unexpected acute paralysis and/or malignant hyperthermia.

When the results of presymptomatic testing are not known, the at-risk family members must be considered at risk for complications and precautions must be taken, particularly in the administration of anesthesia and avoidance of risk factors.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

While in utero acetazolamide exposure is reported to cause limb defects in rodents, acetazolamide therapy during human pregnancy does not appear to increase the risk for fetal malformations [Heinonen et al 1977].
In individuals with HPS-1 and HPS-4, the diagnosis of HPS will be apparent because the hypopigmentation and nystagmus are clinically evident.

In rare families with the milder types (HPS-3, HPS-5, or HPS-6), the evaluation of apparently unaffected sibs may yield a positive diagnosis:

If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known, platelet aggregation or platelet whole mount electron microscopy studies can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancies should proceed normally for an affected mother or an affected fetus. Delivery, however, carries risk for bleeding in a woman with HPS; surveillance and a hematology consultation for anticipation of bleeding complications during delivery should be initiated once pregnancy is confirmed.
If the family-specific CDC73 germline pathogenic variant has been identified, molecular genetic testing should be offered to at-risk relatives starting around age five to ten years in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and/or preventive measures.

When molecular testing for a CDC73 pathogenic variant is not possible or not informative, individuals at 50% risk (first-degree relatives of an individual with CDC73-related disorders) should undergo routine evaluation for primary hyperparathyroidism (see Surveillance).

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Primary hyperparathyroidism during pregnancy may pose increased risks to the mother (symptomatic hypercalcemia) and to the fetus (intrauterine growth retardation, preterm delivery, intrauterine fetal demise, and/or postpartum neonatal hypocalcemia). Conservative observation may be appropriate for mild asymptomatic hypercalcemia, but for symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism or evidence of adverse effects on the fetus, surgery (preferred in the second trimester) is required for definitive treatment. These women should be managed in conjunction with a maternal-fetal medicine specialist.
It is appropriate to evaluate at-risk sibs in early childhood in order to identify those who will develop sensory loss and would benefit from measures to prevent injury to limbs and/or self-mutilation. Molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs if the pathogenic variants in the family are known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
If the pathogenic variants in a family are known, molecular genetic testing may be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk infants so that those who are affected can be monitored to avoid:

Hyperpyrexia and its potential complications, including febrile seizures;

Injuries to the tongue, lips, and teeth when the primary teeth erupt.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known, monitor the body temperature of at-risk infants during the neonatal period (i.e., first 28 days of life).

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

HSP symptoms generally do not change significantly during pregnancy (although, if medications such as baclofen are reduced or discontinued during pregnancy, spasticity may be increased). In general, uncomplicated HSP does not pose increased risk for pregnancy, labor, or delivery. In general, having uncomplicated HSP does not increase risk associated with obstetric anesthesia.
Although clinical experience suggests that early diagnosis of at-risk males allows initiation of ERT before the onset of irreversible changes and often before significant disease progression [Muenzer 2014], it is unclear at present whether early diagnosis (either by newborn screening or testing of at-risk male relatives) is beneficial as no data are available on whether early ERT improves the outcome of the somatic disease in MPS II. ERT is not expected to benefit children with the CNS form of the disease.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Molecular genetic testing should be offered to at-risk family members of persons in whom a pathogenic variant(s) has been identified.

Note: Testing of family members needs to be done with caution because presence of the family-specific pathogenic variant(s) is predisposing rather than causative, and thus is only one of several risk factors required for development of aHUS. Predictions based on a single risk factor in unaffected individuals are unreliable (see Penetrance). Therefore, risk cannot be quantified for a given individual.

The following are appropriate for relatives in whom the family-specific pathogenic variant(s) have been identified:

Monitoring of hemoglobin, platelet count, and serum concentrations of creatinine, LDH, C3, C4, and haptoglobin) when exposed to potential triggering events such as severe infections, inflammation, and pregnancy (see Surveillance)

Avoidance of known precipitants of aHUS (see Clinical Description)

No monitoring is needed for:

Relatives in whom no family-specific pathogenic variant has been identified;

Relatives of persons in whom no pathogenic variant has been identified.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Women with a history of aHUS are at increased risk for aHUS flare during pregnancy and an even greater risk in the post-partum period. Pregnancy-associated aHUS (P-aHUS) occurred in 21 of 100 adult women with aHUS, with 79% presenting post partum [Fakhouri et al 2010]. Treatment consisted mainly of plasma exchange, and the outcomes were poor with 62% developing end-stage renal disease by one month after presentation and 76% by last follow up. The risk for P-aHUS was highest during a second pregnancy. Complement abnormalities were found in 18 of the 21 adult women with P-aHUS. Pregnancies in affected women with complement abnormalities were complicated by fetal loss (in 4.8%) and preeclampsia (7.7%).

On the basis of these results, women with complement dysregulation should be informed of the 20% risk for P-aHUS, and any pregnancy in these women should be closely monitored.

As for eculizumab, the experience gained from pregnant women with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria who had been treated with eculizumab suggest a risk-benefit balance in favor of eculizumab use [Kelly et al 2010]. Similarly, recent data showed that eculizumab can be successfully used for the treatment of aHUS during pregnancy [Ardissino et al 2013, Cañigral et al 2014, De Sousa Amorim et al 2015].
If the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, clarification of the genetic status of at-risk family members (see Figure 1) allows appropriate longitudinal evaluation of those who have the pathogenic variant (see Surveillance and Table 2).

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

The hemodynamic changes associated with pregnancy and delivery place women with familial HCM at increased risk for obstetric complications, particularly if significant obstructive physiology is present. Perinatal care with specialists experienced in cardiovascular medicine and high-risk obstetrics is highly recommended.
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic relatives of an affected individual by molecular genetic testing for the familial REN pathogenic variant in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures. Particularly important are:

Children because of their increased risk for anemia;

Adolescents because of their increased risk for gout, which can be prevented with allopurinol treatment;

Relatives interested in donating a kidney to an affected family member.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Successful pregnancies have been documented in women with a REN pathogenic variant. The rate of miscarriages or other adverse outcomes was not increased.
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of preventive measures, particularly those that would decrease the risk of unexpected acute paralysis or anesthetic events.

Molecular genetic testing can be pursued if the pathogenic variant in the family is known.

When the results of genetic testing or presymptomatic testing are not known, the related family members must be considered at risk for complications and precautions are indicated, particularly during anesthesia.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

More than 90% of affected women report an increase in attack frequency during pregnancy. While approximately 80% reported improved muscle weakness during attacks, 75% also reported worse muscle stiffness during attacks [Charles et al 2013].

Women who are chronically treated with a diuretic may continue treatment in pregnancy. Human data on prenatal exposure to acetazolamide have not demonstrated an increased risk of fetal malformations. Human data on the use of oral dichlorphenamide therapy during pregnancy – and whether it leads to an increased risk of malformations in exposed fetuses – are limited.
The CDC has classified FH as a Tier 1 condition indicating a significant benefit from performing family-based cascade screening using cholesterol testing with or without DNA analysis on relatives of affected persons with FH in order to identify previously unknown cases of FH and provide those people with life-saving treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment of relatives at risk for FH can reduce morbidity and mortality [Goldberg et al 2011, Ned & Sijbrands 2011, Reiner et al 2011].

The genetic status of at-risk family members can be clarified by EITHER of the following:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member

Measurement of LDL-C level. Table 4 provides age-specific total cholesterol and LDL-C levels [Williams et al 1993]. Note: Age-specific LDL cut-offs are also available based on more contemporary data from the United Kingdom [Starr et al 2008].

2. 

An uncle, aunt, nephew, niece, grandparent, grandchild, or half-sib. Second-degree relatives share about one quarter of their genes.

3. 

A first cousin, great-grandparent, or great-grandchild. Third-degree relatives share about one eighth of their genes.

A parent, sib, or child. First-degree relatives share about half of their genes.

An uncle, aunt, nephew, niece, grandparent, grandchild, or half-sib. Second-degree relatives share about one quarter of their genes.

A first cousin, great-grandparent, or great-grandchild. Third-degree relatives share about one eighth of their genes.

Of note, all national and international guidelines for FH call for “cascade testing” of relatives at risk (i.e., systematic testing of first- and second-degree relatives of the index case [proband]). Evidence supports the use of genetic testing in cascade testing algorithms to improve the detection of FH [DeMott et al 2008, Wierzbicki et al 2008, Wald et al 2016].

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Statins are contraindicated during pregnancy; women with FH who are considering a pregnancy should be counseled of this risk and statins should be discontinued prior to conception.

Pregnant women should incorporate all the other recommended lifestyle changes including low saturated and trans unsaturated fat intake, no smoking, and high dietary soluble fiber intake (see Agents/Circumstances to Avoid).

Pharmacologic treatment

during pregnancy

Statins are contraindicated in pregnancy due to concerns for teratogenicity. The use of statins during human pregnancy has not definitively been associated with adverse fetal outcome; however, the role of cholesterol in embryologic development has led to theoretic concerns about the effect of these medications on a developing fetus and a recommendation that alternative medications be considered during pregnancy and lactation. Nursing mothers should not take statins.

Bile acid binding resins (colesevelam, cholestyramine) are generally considered safe (Class B for pregnancy). Based primarily on animal studies, cholestyramine use during pregnancy has not been associated with an increased risk of fetal anomalies. However, use of cholestyramine could theoretically cause depletion of maternal fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin K.

LDL apheresis is also occasionally used.

Regarding other agents:

PCSK9 inhibitors. Use during pregnancy has not been well studied.

Ezetimibe. Use during human pregnancy has not been well studied.

Niacin. The use of pharmacologic doses of niacin, an essential vitamin, has not been studied in human pregnancy. The recommended upper limit of niacin intake during pregnancy is 30-35 mgs/day; higher doses have been associated with toxicity.

Pregnancy Management

There is a paucity of literature regarding pregnancy management in women with skeletal dysplasias. However, a number of women with hypochondroplasia have had unremarkable pregnancies and deliveries.

In comparison to women who have achondroplasia, vaginal deliveries are possible, although for each pregnancy, pelvic outlet capacity should be assessed in relation to fetal head size.

Epidural or spinal anesthetic can be utilized, but a consultation with an anesthesiologist prior to delivery is recommended to assess the spinal anatomy.

If present, spinal stenosis may be aggravated during pregnancy due to the normal physiologic changes to the shape of the spine that occur as gestation progresses.
It is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures (routine eye examinations).

If the pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, physical examination, including examination of the skin, teeth, hair, nails, retina and CNS, can be used to clarify the disease status of at-risk relatives.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management 

Overall pregnancy health and management usually does not vary from normal. The risk of spontaneous abortion is higher than population rates, but management of pregnancy loss is done in the standard manner. For women with retinal problems, delivery management to minimize or eliminate labor should be considered to avoid retinal detachment.

In a family with IIAE3 in which the disease-associated RANBP2 pathogenic variant has been identified, molecular genetic testing of at-risk first-degree relatives, especially children, is warranted so that those who have inherited the RANBP2 pathogenic variant can benefit from prompt intervention in the early stages of ANE (see Treatment of Manifestations).

The ability to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives also reduces unnecessary utilization of resources, such as emergency room visits, for those who have not inherited the RANBP2 pathogenic variant.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
If prenatal testing for IMAGe syndrome has not been performed, it is appropriate to evaluate newborn sibs of a proband to enable prompt diagnosis and management of adrenal insufficiency.

Molecular genetic testing is indicated if the CDKN1C pathogenic variant in the family is known;

If the CDKN1C pathogenic variant in the family is not known, family members can be screened for serum electrolyte abnormalities, elevated serum ACTH level, and skeletal features of IMAGe syndrome, including short stature and delayed bone age.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Risks to a mother with IMAGe syndrome during pregnancy include potential adrenal insufficiency; risks during delivery include cephalopelvic disproportion.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Women with the INAD and atypical NAD forms of PLAN have not been known to reproduce due to the relatively early onset and severity of disease.

Two women with PLA2G6-related dystonia-parkinsonism have been reported to reproduce [Paisán-Ruiz et al 2010, Virmani et al 2014]. Since onset of manifestations of PLAN has been reported as late as age 30 years, some women may become pregnant before onset of symptoms or early in the disease course. For those who may be symptomatic, the main issue is the potential for teratogenic effects of medications taken during pregnancy. It is not known whether pregnancy itself may have short- or long-term effects on the disease course for the affected pregnant woman.
It is appropriate to offer molecular genetic testing to at-risk relatives if the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member so that morbidity and mortality can be reduced by early diagnosis and treatment.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy may increase the size of a growth hormone-secreting adenoma or a prolactin-secreting adenoma (especially macroadenomas); thus, a pregnant woman with pituitary macroadenoma is at risk of developing visual field defects. In each trimester it is appropriate to inquire about headaches and perform visual field testing.
Molecular genetic testing of at-risk males in a family with a known pathogenic variant either prenatally or immediately after birth enables early diagnosis and BMT in affected males before significant organ damage occurs.

If the pathogenic variant is not known, monitoring at-risk males for early-onset diarrhea, diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, and autoimmune hematologic manifestations can allow early identification of affected males.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
No routine testing is recommended because adult presentations are unusual and no early interventions are available.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Once a diagnosis of JHH has been made in a family, all at-risk family members (i.e., sibs) should be tested for the pathogenic variants identified in the affected individual. Family members with two HJV or HAMP pathogenic variants should be followed from early childhood with annual measurement of serum ferritin concentration and transferrin iron saturation to monitor for the development of iron overload.

If a molecular diagnosis was not made or the genetic status of the sibs of an affected individual is unknown, the sibs should be followed from early childhood with annual measurement of serum ferritin concentration and transferrin iron saturation to monitor for the development of iron overload.

If juvenile hemochromatosis is detected before evidence of organ damage, either by molecular genetic testing in relatives at-risk or by biochemical testing (i.e., serum ferritin concentration and transferrin-iron saturation), treatment via phlebotomy can reverse or prevent many of the secondary complications resulting from organ damage.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

All pregnant women with JHH should be under the care of a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, an endocrinologist, and a cardiologist. Preferably women with JHH should be seen by these specialists prior to becoming pregnant.

Pregnancy in women with untreated JHH is high risk because the increased hemodynamic burden of pregnancy can precipitate cardiac failure in women with an underlying cardiomyopathy. Of note, it is critically important for specialists in endocrinology and infertility to be aware of JHH as a cause of infertility and to evaluate patients for iron overload prior to correcting the underlying hormonal imbalance. In a case report, a young woman who became pregnant following correction of her hypogonadotropic hypogonadism developed fatal cardiogenic shock; she was only identified as having JHH with severe iron overload at the time of presentation of her heart disease [Filali et al 2004].
It is appropriate to evaluate sibs and parents of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk family members.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known, ECG testing should be undertaken to evaluate for QT prolongation.

Standard newborn screening programs are sufficient to identify hearing loss in children with JLNS.

Because of the relationship between JLNS and long QT syndrome, ECG should be considered for relatives at risk for JLNS even if they have normal hearing.

If the JLNS-causing pathogenic variants in an affected family member are known, molecular genetic testing of a relative with congenital profound sensorineural hearing loss is recommended to confirm the diagnosis of JLNS.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Consideration should be given as to whether a mother who has a fetus affected with JLNS herself has long QT syndrome [Seth et al 2007].
Sibs or relatives who have clinical features similar to those of an individual with JS warrant genetic consultation. If the pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in a proband, testing symptomatic relatives for these pathogenic variants is appropriate.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy in women with Parkinson disease is a rare event. Only one case of a successful pregnancy in a woman with parkin type of early-onset Parkinson disease has been reported [Serikawa et al 2011]. The 27-year old woman successfully gave birth to spontaneously conceived dichorionic/diamnionic male twins. Exacerbation of her motor disabilities was noted during late pregnancy. She was treated with levodopa/carbidopa only during the period of organogenesis. Both babies were born healthy, without any evidence of psychomotor impairment two years after birth.

Worsening of parkinsonian symptoms could in part be explained by the reduction of dopaminergic replacement therapy. If possible, dopaminergic medication should be limited to levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitor to minimize the potential risk for teratogenicity at least over the course of the embryonic phase.
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

In families in which findings suggest JPS or families with a known BMPR1A pathogenic variant, evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing in the first to second decade of life if the pathogenic variant in the family is known;

If the familial pathogenic variant is not known, CBC and lower intestinal endoscopy in individuals age 15 years an older. Normal results do not rule out a diagnosis of JPS (see Surveillance for additional recommendations).

In families in which findings suggest JPS/HHT syndrome or families with a known SMAD4 pathogenic variant:

Molecular genetic testing before age 15 years for children at risk for an SMAD4 pathogenic variant should be offered because the surveillance for HHT-related findings begins earlier in childhood than the surveillance for polyps.

In families in which findings suggest JPS/HHT syndrome but the familial pathogenic variant is not known:

CBC and lower intestinal endoscopy in individuals age 15 years an older. Normal results do not rule out a diagnosis of JPS (see Surveillance for additional recommendations).

Individuals older than age 40 years, targeted medical history and clinical examination for features of HHT. The absence of mild but recurrent epistaxis and subtle telangiectases in characteristic locations on careful examination is reassuring (see Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia).

In individuals age 40 years and younger, targeted medical history and clinical examination for features of HHT as well as initial evaluation for brain and pulmonary AVMs, as features of HHT may not be identified by medical history and clinical examination in younger individuals.

Pregnancy Management

The management of a pregnant woman with a KCNQ3 pathogenic variant is the same as that of any other pregnant woman with a history of (or at risk for) epilepsy:

No medication is indicated if (a) the woman has been seizure free and is not taking medication or (b) the woman has no history of seizures.

Antiepileptic drug treatment may be continued for active epilepsy during pregnancy.

In general, women with epilepsy or a seizure disorder from any cause are at greater risk for mortality during pregnancy than pregnant women without a seizure disorder; use of antiepileptic medication during pregnancy reduces this risk. However, exposure to antiepileptic medication may increase the risk for adverse fetal outcome (depending on the drug used, the dose, and the stage of pregnancy at which medication is taken). Nevertheless, the risk of an adverse outcome to the fetus from antiepileptic medication exposure is often less than that associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Therefore, use of antiepileptic medication to treat a maternal seizure disorder during pregnancy is typically recommended. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given antiepileptic drug during pregnancy should ideally take place prior to conception. Transitioning to a lower-risk medication prior to pregnancy may be possible [Sarma et al 2016].

Pregnancy Management

Although the cutaneous manifestations of KS are not exacerbated by pregnancy, vaginal stenosis and labial synechiae have been reported; thus, obstetric planning, such as consideration of delivery by elective cesarean section, warrants consideration [Mansur et al 2007]. Of note, specialized perioperative cesarean section management is needed to protect vulnerable skin and mucosa.

Breast-feeding is not advised because of the risk of blistering the breasts [Hayashi et al 2007].
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from surveillance and prompt initiation of treatment.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known. However, a prepubertal child with a known pathogenic variant may progress through puberty in a normal fashion, delayed fashion, or not at all. Therefore, reevaluation of such individuals over time is important, and hormone treatment should be initiated only when IGD with impaired pubertal development is diagnosed.

If the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are not known, clinical review of at-risk relatives of pubertal age to assess clinical onset of signs of puberty and if delayed, to initiate appropriate therapy for pubertal induction.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
If the disease has been identified in an affected family member, it is appropriate to test siblings so that morbidity and mortality can be reduced by early diagnosis and treatment with HSCT using umbilical cord blood [Escolar et al 2005].

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to evaluation of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate the sibs of a proband in order to identify those who would benefit from early institution of treatment.

If the LIPA pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

If the LIPA pathogenic variants in the family are not known, assay of lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) enzyme activity can be used to assist in the identification of affected sibs.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

The authors are aware of several affected mothers who have had children. There do not appear to be specific risks for the mother or fetus other than the risk of recurrence of LBSL in the fetus (see Genetic Counseling).

Pregnancy Management

Edema may be exacerbated during pregnancy.
Using molecular genetic testing for the SPRED1 pathogenic variant found in the proband, it is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk (e.g., parents, younger and older sibs of a proband) with café au lait macules to identify as early as possible those who could benefit from institution of treatment and preventive measures.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

It is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

If the PTPN11, RAF1,

BRAF, or MAP2K1 pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, a thorough physical examination with particular attention to the features of NSML may clarify the disease status of at-risk relatives.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

For affected women, cardiac status should be monitored during pregnancy. Those with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or valve dysfunction may be at risk for the development or exacerbation of heart failure during pregnancy, especially during the second and third trimesters.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual by molecular genetic testing of the CAPN3 pathogenic variant in the family in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of evaluation and subsequent surveillance. With the associated intrafamilial phenotype variability, the possibility of calpainopathy should not be excluded in sibs on the basis of absence of symptoms alone.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Women with calpainopathy do not have impaired uterine smooth muscle strength or function and typically have uncomplicated pregnancies. A higher incidence of abnormal fetal presentation was reported in wheelchair-bound individuals with LGMD [Awater et al 2012]. Epidural blockade can be difficult in those with severe spine deformities and appropriate general anaesthesia may be necessary. About half of persons with LGMD reported deterioration of clinical symptoms in pregnancy [Awater et al 2012].
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Affected mothers are at no specific disease-related risks during pregnancy. Anecdotal improvement of the ichthyosis with return to baseline after delivery has been reported.
Once a TP53 pathogenic variant has been identified in a family, testing of at-risk relatives can identify those family members who also have the familial pathogenic variant and thus need increased surveillance and early intervention when a cancer is identified. However, families with LFS need to be cautioned that currently no definitive evidence demonstrates a benefit for increased surveillance or early intervention.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Women with LFS who are pregnant should bring any potential symptoms of cancer to the attention of their physicians. Women with LFS who are pregnant can continue to have clinical breast exams and/or breast imaging studies if indicated.

There are no special recommendations for screening a fetus identified as having a germlineTP53 pathogenic variant. Once the infant is born, he or she can be evaluated for signs of cancer.

Prenatal testing or testing of males at risk for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome immediately after birth enables prompt initiation of allopurinol therapy.

Some carrier females develop gout in later years; thus, establishing carrier status of female relatives through genetic testing may be valuable to their clinical management.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
If the causal TGFBR1,

TGFBR2, SMAD3, or TGFB2 pathogenic variant is identified in the proband, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify genetic status of family members at risk to identify those individuals who need regular cardiovascular follow-up screening to detect aortic aneurysm early and initiate appropriate medical or surgical intervention.

If the causal pathogenic variant is not known, relatives at risk should be evaluated for signs of the disorder. Echocardiography and extensive vascular imaging of relatives is indicated upon appreciation of any suspicious signs of LDS, and even in apparently unaffected individuals if findings are subtle in the index case.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy can be dangerous for women with LDS. Complications include aortic dissection/rupture or uterine rupture during pregnancy or delivery, or aortic dissection/rupture in the immediate postpartum period. Increased frequency of aortic imaging is recommended, both during pregnancy and in the weeks following delivery. However, with appropriate supervision and high-risk obstetrical management, women with Loeys-Dietz syndrome can tolerate pregnancy and delivery [Gutman et al 2009].
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
If the pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, it is appropriate to offer molecular genetic testing to at-risk sibs in order to reduce morbidity and mortality through early diagnosis and treatment.

When molecular testing is not available, early diagnosis of at-risk sibs relies on careful clinical evaluation and determination of plasma and urinary amino acid concentrations and orotic acid urinary excretion.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate at-risk sibs during infancy. Early diagnosis and implementation of dietary fat intake restriction can prevent symptoms and related medical complications.

Evaluations can include:

Measurement of plasma triglyceride concentration;

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to evaluation of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

During pregnancy in a woman with LPL deficiency, extreme dietary fat restriction to less than two grams per day during the second and third trimester with close monitoring of plasma triglyceride concentration can result in delivery of a normal infant with normal plasma concentrations of essential fatty acids [Al-Shali et al 2002].

One woman with LPL deficiency delivered a normal child following a one-gram per day fat diet and treatment with gemfibrozil (600 mg/day) [Tsai et al 2004]. Despite concerns about the possibility of essential fatty acid deficiency in the newborn, normal essential fatty acids were found in cord blood, as were normal levels of fibrate metabolites.

See MotherToBaby for further information on medication use during pregnancy.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes. In one family, recurrent spontaneous abortions have been noted.

Pregnancy Management

Affected mother. To date pregnancy has been observed in one affected female with an unaffected fetus. The pregnancy was uneventful, but delivery was induced because of elevated maternal blood pressure. Delivery was vaginal with normal healing and no signs of prolapse. Two years after delivery both the mother and her son were doing well.

Despite evidence for the possibility of relatively normal pregnancy, a risk of aggravation of cardiopulmonary manifestations, and increased risk of both uterine rupture and exacerbation of pelvic floor/organ insufficiency including uterine, bladder, and rectal prolapse cannot be excluded based on this single case. Therefore, it is recommended that follow up of pregnancy and the postnatal period be done in a high-risk obstetric care unit with experience in connective tissue disorders.

Affected fetus

Major complications, such as preterm premature rupture of membranes, have not been reported during pregnancy with affected fetuses.

Polyhydramnios has been described in two instances in association with esophageal tortuosity or diverticulosis [Callewaert et al 2013].
It is appropriate to evaluate the siblings of a patient with SHOX deficiency in order to identify as early as possible those who would also benefit from recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) treatment.

It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of an individual with genetically confirmed MAP by molecular genetic testing of the MUTYH pathogenic variants identified in the proband in order to reduce morbidity and mortality in those who would benefit from appropriate surveillance, early diagnosis, and treatment.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Relatives of an individual with Marfan syndrome should be evaluated for signs of the disorder. Molecular genetic evaluation of relatives at risk is possible if the FBN1 pathogenic variant has been identified in the proband.

Echocardiography of relatives is indicated upon appreciation of any suspicious signs of Marfan syndrome, and even in apparently unaffected individuals if findings are subtle in the index case. It is generally appropriate to delay echocardiography for infants and toddlers until they can cooperate with the examination without needing sedation. Exceptions include those with evidence of valve dysfunction and/or congestive heart failure.

Note: All first-degree relatives of an individual with apparent isolated aortic enlargement should be evaluated by echocardiography.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to evaluation of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy should only be considered after appropriate counseling from a clinical geneticist or cardiologist familiar with this condition, a genetic counselor, and a high-risk obstetrician because of the risk of more rapid dilation of the aorta or aortic dissection either during pregnancy or delivery, or in the immediate postpartum period. This is especially relevant to women who begin pregnancy with a maximal aortic dimension that exceeds 4.0 cm. Note: Some women with Marfan syndrome and aortic root dilatation opt for elective aortic repair with a valve-sparing procedure prior to reaching a conventional threshold for surgical intervention (i.e. at a root dimension <5.0cm) before becoming pregnant.

Pregnant women with Marfan syndrome should be followed by a high risk obstetrician both during pregnancy and through the immediate postpartum period.

In women with Marfan syndrome who anticipate pregnancy or become pregnant, beta blockers should be continued, but some other classes of medications such as ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers should be stopped because of the risk for fetal loss and birth defects.

Effort should be made to minimize cardiovascular stress through pregnancy and delivery.

Cardiovascular imaging with echocardiography should be performed every two to three months during pregnancy to monitor aortic root size and growth. Monitoring should continue in the immediate postpartum period due to an increased risk for aortic dissection.

The choice between a controlled vaginal delivery and cesarean section remains controversial.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs and parents of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from institution of treatment and preventive measures [Leydiker et al 2011].

If the ACADM pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

If the ACADM pathogenic variants in the family are not known, plasma acylcarnitine and urine acylglycine analysis can be used to clarify the disease status of at-risk sibs.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnant women who have MCAD deficiency must avoid catabolism. This is supported by several case reports describing carnitine deficiency, acute liver failure, and HELLP syndrome in pregnant women with MCAD deficiency [Nelson et al 2000, Santos et al 2007, Leydiker et al 2011].
Because FD/MAS is not inherited, relatives are not at increased risk and do not require evaluation.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management 

Although the effects of pregnancy on bone and endocrine disease in women with FD/MAS are not well studied, in the authors’ experience most women do not experience a worsening of disease during pregnancy.
For the purpose of early diagnosis and treatment. If the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives (parents, sibs, and offspring). Relatives found to have a pathogenic variant can be monitored with serum creatinine measurements to allow early diagnosis and treatment (see Related Genetic Counseling Issues for discussion of testing of children.)

For the purpose of kidney donation. If an MUC1 pathogenic variant is known to be present in an affected family member, any relative who is a potential kidney donor should undergo molecular genetic testing to clarify his/her genetic status so that only those without the pathogenic variant are evaluated further. Several individuals with what appeared to be clinically normal kidney function have donated kidneys and later been found to have ADTKD, MUC1.Thus, it is important to test even those family members with normal kidney function to be certain that they do not have a pathogenic variant.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic relatives of an affected individual by molecular genetic testing for the familial UMOD pathogenic variant in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures. Particularly important are:

Adolescents because of their increased risk for gout, which can be prevented with allopurinol treatment;

Relatives interested in donating a kidney to an affected family member.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

No pregnancy issues are particular to ADTKD-UMOD. However, in general, chronic kidney disease, depending on the stage, can affect pregnancy through increased hypertension and increased fetal loss.

Women of childbearing age who are taking medications such as allopurinol or an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor should discuss their medication regimen with their physician prior to conception.

A recent study has suggested that allopurinol use during pregnancy may be associated with fetal malformations. While the study included women who were on many other medications when they became pregnant, allopurinol should be discontinued in women who are pregnant or who may become pregnant [Hoeltzenbein et al 2013].

Similarly, the use of ACE inhibitors during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in fetal damage and death. Women who are taking ACE inhibitors prior to pregnancy or at the time of conception should be transitioned to another antihypertensive medication.

Ideally, women should not be taking either allopurinol or an ACE inhibitor during pregnancy.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

In female heterozygotes, the probability of manifestations of the McLeod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome in the reproductive period is presumably very low; thus, no particular recommendations can be made. Of note, transfusion reactions have to be considered in female carriers who have the McLeod blood group phenotype (see Prevention of Secondary Complications).

No prenatal or perinatal neurologic manifestations of MLS are known; however, severe anemia can be observed in Kell-positive newborns born to sensitized Kell-negative mothers [Lee et al 2000b, Jung et al 2007].
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Using genomic testing that will detect the 15q13.3 microdeletion found in the proband, it is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from close assessment/monitoring of developmental milestones in childhood.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

If a fetus is known to have 15q24 microdeletion syndrome, fetal echocardiogram and ultrasound examination with an attempt to visualize the palate and look for diaphragmatic hernia are recommended. Close monitoring for intrauterine growth retardation is warranted. Counseling with regard to the developmental outcomes and medical complications of the 15q24 microdeletion syndrome is appropriate. Delivery at a center with a good neonatal intensive care team is optimal, as respiratory complications and feeding difficulties may occur after delivery.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
If genomic testing detects the 17q12 recurrent deletion in one of the proband’s parents, it is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of older and younger sibs of the proband and other relatives at risk in order to identify those who would benefit from close assessment/monitoring for evidence of renal structural or functional defects, maturity-onset diabetes of the young, and developmental delays/intellectual disability.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Using genomic testing that will detect the 1q21.1 recurrent microdeletion found in the proband, it is appropriate to evaluate the sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from close assessment/monitoring of developmental milestones in childhood.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Parents and older and younger at-risk sibs of a proband should be tested for the 3q29 recurrent deletion. Parents or sibs may have the deletion, but with only mild or nonexistent developmental delay or intellectual disability. The average age at onset for schizophrenia is 20-25 years; thus, mildly affected individuals remain at risk for neuropsychiatric manifestations and would benefit from monitoring and clinical evaluation.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management 

Macrosomia and/or macrocephaly of prenatal onset is present in many individuals with 9q22.3 microdeletion. This may necessitate delivery by Cesarean section, including emergently, as has been reported for some individuals [Isidor et al 2013].
It is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from institution of treatment and preventive measures. If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

Molecular genetic testing of at-risk maternal relatives may reveal individuals who have high mutational loads and are thus at risk of developing symptoms. However, no proven disease-modifying intervention exists at present.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Infertility may preclude pregnancy in some affected individuals. Women with MELAS should receive genetic counseling prior to pregnancy. During pregnancy, affected or at-risk women should be monitored for diabetes mellitus and respiratory insufficiency, which may require therapeutic interventions [Díaz-Lobato et al 2005].
Molecular genetic testing should be offered to at-risk members of a family in which a germline MEN1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected relative [Lairmore et al 2004].

When molecular genetic testing for an MEN1 pathogenic variant is not possible or is not informative, individuals at 50% risk (i.e., first-degree relatives of an individual with MEN1 syndrome) should undergo routine evaluation (see Surveillance).

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures. The American Society of Clinical Oncologists (ASCO) identifies MEN 2 as a Group 1 disorder, i.e., a well-defined hereditary cancer syndrome for which genetic testing is considered part of the standard management for at-risk family members [American Society of Clinical Oncology 2003]. Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant in the family is known:

MEN 2A.

RET molecular genetic testing should be offered to at-risk children by age five years. The finding of MTC in the thyroid of a 12-month-old with a RET pathogenic variant suggests that molecular genetic testing should be performed even earlier when possible [Machens et al 2004].

FMTC. Recommendations for families with known FMTC are the same as for MEN 2A.

MEN 2B.

RET molecular genetic testing should be performed as soon as possible after birth in all children known to be at risk [Brandi et al 2001].

The following screening of at-risk family members if the pathogenic variant in the family is not known:

Neck ultrasound examination and basal and/or stimulated calcitonin measurements for MTC

Albumin-corrected calcium or ionized calcium for hyperparathyroidism

Measurement of plasma or 24-hour urine metanephrines and normetanephrines as appropriate [American Thyroid Association Guidelines Task Force 2009] for pheochromocytoma

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Women with MEN 2 should be screened for pheochromocytoma prior to a planned pregnancy, or as early as possible during an unplanned pregnancy [American Thyroid Association Guidelines Task Force 2009].
It is appropriate to test male relatives at risk for Menkes disease for the ATP7A pathogenic variant identified in the family before age ten days in order to promptly begin copper replacement treatment (see Prevention of Primary Manifestations).

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from institution of treatment and preventive measures.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

During pregnancy, affected or at-risk women should be monitored for diabetes mellitus and respiratory insufficiency, which may require therapeutic interventions.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Manifestations of MFDM in an affected fetus may include intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), polyhydramnios, increased nuchal translucency, and/or fetal structural anomalies (e.g., cardiac and renal defects). Management of an affected fetus should include a detailed (‘level II’) fetal ultrasound assessment, and consultation(s) with high-risk obstetrics and/or neonatology, as appropriate for the clinical situation.

The delivery room team should be aware of the possible need for intubation in the event of airway compromise.

Polyhydramnios, if present, should prompt urgent postnatal evaluation for esophageal atresia.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management 

Affected pregnant women may need assistance during delivery if they have significant weakness of their abdominal muscles.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
If a pathogenic variant has been identified in the family, molecular genetic testing of at-risk relatives is warranted to identify those who also have the pathogenic variant and thus will benefit from avoiding anesthetic agents that increase the risk for a malignant hyperthermia episode.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

If a pregnant woman with MHS requires non-emergent surgery during the pregnancy, a non-triggering anesthetic (local, nerve block, epidural, spinal anesthesia, or a total intravenous general anesthetic) should be administered. Standard American Society of Anesthesiologists mandated monitoring should be used, along with core temperature monitoring. Fetal monitoring should follow standard guidelines. Dantrolene should not be administered in preparation for surgery or labor and delivery.

Continuous epidural analgesia is highly recommended for labor and delivery. If a Cesarean delivery is indicated in a woman who does not have an epidural catheter in place, neuraxial (spinal, epidural, or combined spinal-epidural) anesthesia is recommended, if not otherwise contraindicated. If a general anesthetic is indicated, a total intravenous anesthetic technique should be administered, with an anesthesia machine that has been prepared for an MH-susceptible individual.

In the case of a fetus whose father is known to be MH susceptible but whose mother is not known to be MH susceptible, regional anesthesia or general anesthesia without trigger agents is recommended.

For further information regarding the management of pregnant women with MHS, see 2009 guidelines developed by the Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States.

Therapies Under Investigations

Preliminary investigation by Lanner et al [2012] has shown that 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) prevents heat-induced sudden death in a knock-out mouse model of MH. This finding is suggestive of possible effectiveness of AICAR in the prophylactic treatment of humans with enhanced susceptibility to exercise/ heat-induced sudden death associated with mutation of RYR1.

If the FLT4 pathogenic variant in a family is known, molecular genetic testing of at-risk relatives ensures identification of those who will benefit from treatment early in the disease course.

If the pathogenic variant in a family is not known, evaluation of relatives at risk by physical examination is appropriate in order to identify those who will benefit from treatment early in the course of the disease. The use of properly fitted compression hosiery and advice to reduce the risk of cellulitis of the legs and feet can be beneficial.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management 

Ultrasound scanning during pregnancy may indicate if a fetus is affected if swelling of the dorsum of the feet is noted in the second or third trimester. The fetus may have mild pleural effusions which frequently resolve before birth [S Mansour, personal communication]. Very rarely, the fetus may present with hydrops fetalis. If the mother is affected by Milroy disease there may be an increase in swelling during the pregnancy.

It is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known:

Sisters of females with MKS should have examination of the external genitalia for vaginal membranes or an imperforate vagina and of the hands and feet for polydactyly, and an echocardiogram for the congenital heart defects associated with MKS.

Brothers of affected females should have an examination of the external genitalia for hypospadias, cryptorchidism, and chordee and of the hands and feet for polydactyly, and an echocardiogram for cardiac manifestations of MKS.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Since individuals with ML II do not survive into adulthood, there have not been any reports of affected individuals who have become pregnant.

In women who have a fetus diagnosed prenatally with ML II, the fetus should be carefully monitored for intrauterine growth retardation and skeletal changes such as extraosseous calcifications and/or osteolytic lesions. Ultrasound abnormalities are not present in all affected pregnancies.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
If both pathogenic alleles have been identified in the family, testing of at-risk sibs can be pursued. Note, however, that early diagnosis of affected individuals does not delay or halt disease progression [Author, personal observation].

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Depending on the genotype and phenotype of the proband, evaluation of sibs at risk should be performed using biochemical testing with treatment instituted as soon as possible if a sib is affected. Molecular genetic testing (if the pathogenic variants in the family are known) or cellular enzymology typically can further confirm the results of biochemical studies. Prenatal diagnosis of at-risk sibs may allow for prompt treatment of affected newborns at the time of delivery.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Oral and intramuscular vitamin B12 has been administered to women pregnant with a fetus with vitamin B12-responsive MMA, resulting in decreased maternal MMA urine output [Ampola et al 1975, van der Meer et al 1990]. Despite these observations, maternal vitamin B12 supplementation for isolated MMA needs further study.

Despite high maternal MMA levels, fetal growth and development were normal for all reported pregnancies of women with MMA [Wasserstein et al 1999, Deodato et al 2002].

Complications observed in pregnancies of women with MMA can include acute decompensation or hyperammonemia, deterioration of renal function, and obstetric complications including preeclampsia, preterm delivery, and cæsarean section [Raval et al 2015].
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

In women with MmD, there is risk for malignant hyperthermia during delivery if inhalational anesthetic agents are used. A woman who has a fetus affected by MmD may develop polyhydramnios during pregnancy and may report a history of poor fetal movements. Abnormal presentation of an affected fetus may complicate delivery.
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the TYMP pathogenic variants in the family are known;

Measurements of thymidine phosphorylase enzyme (See Establishing the Diagnosis, thymidine phosphorylase enzyme) activity or plasma concentrations of thymidine and deoxyuridine (see Establishing the Diagnosis, Plasma concentrations of thymidine and deoxyuridine) if the TYMP pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

Pregnancy Management

No information on pregnancy management and outcomes is available.
Because the goal of management in familial monosomy 7 is early diagnosis for initiation of BMT prior to the emergence of a leukemic clone, it is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk including sibs and potentially maternal first cousins, based on kindreds described in Mode of Inheritance.

In sibs and cousins of individuals with a history of familial monosomy 7, signs and symptoms that cannot be accounted for otherwise should be evaluated by their physicians as potential early indications of the cytopenias and bone marrow dysplasia which appear prior to the development of AML or MDS.

To evaluate sibs at risk, perform cytogenetic studies/chromosomal microarray (CMA) on bone marrow or unstimulated peripheral blood (FISH and/or conventional cytogenetics), hematologic studies, and hemoglobin F assessment. If these are normal, repeat of hematologic studies on a yearly basis is reasonable, followed by chromosomal studies if abnormalities are detected.

If pathogenic variants in CFH have been identified in an affected individual, sibs can be offered molecular genetic testing to identify those who have the same variant(s) in order to facilitate early diagnosis and management of renal disease. Penetrance rates, however, are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Sibs of affected individuals should be identified either through molecular genetic testing of IDUA, if both pathogenic variants in the family are known, or assay of IDUA enzyme activity in order to initiate therapy as early in the course of disease as possible.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Key elements of the management of women with MPS I who become pregnant involve assessment and frequent monitoring of cardiorespiratory as well as spinal cord involvement.
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of ERT (see Treatment of Manifestations). Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known;

Analysis of N-acetylgalactosamine 6-sulfatase (GALNS) enzyme activity if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Early diagnosis of at-risk sibs of an affected individual may allow asymptomatic infants to be managed out of hospital by experienced providers.

Newborn at-risk sibs who have not undergone prenatal testing can be tested in one of two ways:

Plasma amino acid analysis of a sample obtained at approximately 24 hours of life. In some laboratories, samples obtained earlier can yield false negative results.

If the pathogenic variants have been identified in the family, a cord blood sample can be used for molecular genetic testing.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

With the advent of newborn screening and preventive care, more women with MSUD are surviving to child-bearing age. Successful delivery of a healthy baby is possible for women with classic MSUD. Reports include Van Calcar et al [1992] and Grünewald et al [1998].

Elevated maternal leucine plasma concentration, like elevated maternal phenylalanine plasma concentration, is likely teratogenic. If a woman with MSUD is planning a pregnancy, metabolic control should be maintained in a rigorous fashion preceding and throughout the gestation. Keeping the maternal plasma levels of the branched-chain amino acids between 100 and 300 μmol/L is compatible with delivery of a normal infant [Grünewald et al 1998].

During the development of the placenta and fetus, maternal BCAA and protein requirements increase, and frequent monitoring of plasma amino acid concentrations and fetal growth may be necessary to avoid essential amino acid deficiencies [Grünewald et al 1998].

The post-partum period is dangerous for the mother. Catabolic stress of labor, involutional changes of the uterus, and internal sequestration of blood are potential sources of metabolic decompensation [Chuang & Shih 2001]. Appropriate monitoring at a metabolic referral center is advised at the time of delivery.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

When large skull defects are identified prenatally, consideration should be given to delivery planning (e.g., indications to use scalp electrodes, forceps, or vacuum extraction could be reviewed). Elective Caesarian section may theoretically reduce the risk of traumatic birth injury.
In a family in which the mtDNA pathogenic variant is known, prospective molecular genetic testing of at-risk maternal relatives allows early detection of those who have inherited the mtDNA pathogenic variant and would benefit from avoiding aminoglycosides to prevent onset of hearing loss.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Use of aminoglycoside antibiotics during pregnancy in a mother who has the MT-RNR1 m.1555A>G pathogenic variant should be considered only in the absence of other treatment options, as these antibiotics exhibit incomplete placental transfer.

Of note, if the mother has the MT-RNR1 m.1555A>G pathogenic variant, she will pass it on to the fetus; hence, use of aminoglycosides should be avoided in the newborn.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from institution of treatment and preventive measures (particularly in individuals affected with craniosynostosis, hearing loss, developmental delay, and/or cognitive disability).

Evaluation includes targeted molecular genetic testing for the FGFR3 c.749C>G pathogenic variant.

It is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

Assessing platelet count and size in a newborn at risk for MYH9RD identifies those at risk for bleeding.

If the family-specific pathogenic variant is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to evaluate at-risk family members so that early diagnosis can inform treatment.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Deliveries should be managed as they are in women with other forms of thrombocytopenia (MYH9RD is not usually associated with defects of platelet function). As expected, pregnant women whose thrombocytopenia and bleeding history before pregnancy are more severe have a higher incidence of delivery-related bleeding. In general, a platelet count of ≥50 x 109/L is recommended for safe delivery. Vaginal deliveries in women with severe thrombocytopenia should be considered at increased risk for neonatal intracranial bleeding [Noris et al 2014b].

Because individuals with myotonia congenita may be at increased risk for adverse anesthesia-related events, testing of at-risk individuals during childhood to clarify their genetic status is appropriate.

If the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

If the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are not known, electromyography can be used to clarify the disease status of at-risk relatives.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

For an affected mother, a comprehensive birth plan is recommended [Gorthi et al 2013] to minimize the risks of muscular spasms due to factors such as medications, intramuscular injections, and cold.
It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic at-risk adult relatives of an affected individual to allow for early diagnosis and treatment of cardiac manifestations, diabetes mellitus, and cataracts.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Women with DM1 are at risk for complications during pregnancy including increased spontaneous abortion rate, premature labor, prolonged labor, retained placenta, placenta previa, and postpartum hemorrhage [Zaki et al 2007, Argov & de Visser 2009]. Special surveillance during pregnancy of women with DM1 includes ultrasound examination; evaluation for placenta previa; and anticipation of possible polyhydramnios, prolonged labor, and/or need for delivery by cesarean section [Argov & de Visser 2009]. Complications related to the presence of congenital DM1 in the fetus include reduced fetal movement and polyhydramnios. Awater et al [2012] found increased rates of caesarean birth and preterm delivery among women with DM1.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Early diagnosis of NPS in at-risk family members allows for ophthalmologic and renal screening, especially in individuals with mild-moderate skeletal involvement who may not otherwise come to clinical attention. Molecular genetic testing can be used if the pathogenic variant in the family is known; otherwise, monitor renal findings (i.e., blood pressure, urinalysis, and urine albumin:creatinine ratio on a first-morning urine) and screen for glaucoma.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management 

Renal problems may present during (or be exacerbated by) pregnancy and in one study 29% of pregnant women with NPS developed preeclampsia [Sweeney et al 2003]. Hence, frequent urinalysis and blood pressure measurement is recommended in pregnant women with NPS. Medication used to treat renal disease, such as ACE inhibitors, should be reviewed ideally prior to pregnancy, or at least as soon as pregnancy is recognized, so that transition to an alternative treatment can be considered in order to avoid potential adverse effects of ACE inhibitors on the developing fetus.

It is appropriate to test at-risk infants for the family-specific pathogenic variant(s) as early as possible to allow for prompt diagnosis and treatment to reduce morbidity from hypernatremia, dehydration, and dilation of the urinary tract.

Since autosomal dominant NDI is usually less severe than X-linked or autosomal recessive NDI, genetic testing of sibs of affected children may be performed at a later stage.

Asymptomatic female family members of a male with X-linked NDI who are at risk of being a carrier of the pathogenic variant may undergo genetic counseling and genetic testing when they are of reproductive age.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Carriers of X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus may experience a mild increase in urinary output and associated thirst during pregnancy.

No pregnancies in women with NDI resulting from two AQP2 pathogenic variants have been reported to date.

Polyhydramnios is found in a minority of pregnancies in which the fetus is affected by NDI. In cases of severe polyhydramnios and maternal discomfort, frequent amniotic fluid drainage may be necessary [Kollamparambil et al 2011].
It is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from medical surveillance and preventive measures.

If the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

If the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are not known, a targeted clinical examination, with or without neurophysiologic testing, can clarify whether a muscle biopsy should be considered.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy and delivery are relatively well tolerated by women with NM [Ryan et al 2001].

A high frequency of obstetric complications is associated with an affected fetus, including polyhydramnios, decreased fetal movements, and abnormal presentation and/or fetal distress [Ryan et al 2001].
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of a proband with NPH in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and surveillance measures.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the NPH-related pathogenic variants in the family are known;

Monitoring of renal function and blood pressure if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Although most pregnancies in women with NF1 are normal, serious complications can occur [Chetty et al 2011, Terry et al 2013].

Many women with NF1 experience a rapid increase in the number and size of neurofibromas during pregnancy.

Hypertension may first become symptomatic or, if preexisting, may be greatly exacerbated during pregnancy.

Large pelvic or genital neurofibromas can complicate delivery, and cesarean section appears to be necessary more often in pregnant women with NF1 than in other women.
Consideration of molecular genetic testing of at-risk family members (see Genetic Counseling) during childhood is appropriate for surveillance:

Early identification of relatives who have inherited the family-specific NF2 pathogenic variant allows for appropriate screening using MRI for neuroimaging and brain stem auditory evoked response (BAER) testing for audiologic evaluation, thus resulting in earlier detection of disease manifestations and improved final outcomes [Evans et al 2005a].

Early identification of those who have not inherited the family-specific NF2 pathogenic variant eliminates the need for costly screening with MRI and BAER testing.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Although no convincing evidence exists that schwannomas increase in size during pregnancy, hormonal effects on meningiomas are possible; therefore, assessment of the potential risk of increased intracranial pressure is important for women considering pregnancy.
It is appropriate to offer molecular genetic testing for the NBN pathogenic variants identified in the proband to apparently asymptomatic sibs of a proband and young adult relatives at risk of being carriers (heterozygotes) in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from monitoring for malignancy (see Surveillance) and to inform treatment options if a malignancy is diagnosed (see Agents/Circumstances to Avoid).

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Biochemical genetic testing to promote early diagnosis and treatment of at-risk newborn sibs is indicated. If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, such testing can be followed with molecular genetic testing.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy has been reported in one woman with mild glycine encephalopathy. No obvious teratogenic effect was observed [Ellaway et al 2001].

There is currently no effective treatment for pregnancies in which the fetus is affected with glycine encephalopathy.
Evaluation of at-risk relatives prenatally or as soon as possible after birth enables early identification of infants at high risk for congenital hypothyroidism and pulmonary disease, permitting early diagnosis and management, and particularly, prevention of the neurodevelopmental consequences of untreated hypothyroidism.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the NKX2-1 pathogenic variant in the family is known;

If a pathogenic variant has not been identified, assessment of thyroid function in a family with benign hereditary chorea or brain-lung-thyroid syndrome.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

There is no known increased risk during pregnancy for a woman with an NKX2-1-related disorder.

Prior to pregnancy or early in gestation, it is recommended that a woman work with her physician to determine the safety for the fetus of the use of any medication she is taking for chorea.

Pregnancy Management

A planned delivery at 34 weeks’ gestation of a male with an established NDP pathogenic variant (in whom retinal detachment was excluded following fetal ultrasonography at 28 and 33 weeks) was reported [Sisk et al 2014]. Authors describe treatment at two days of life with laser ablation of the avascular retina in both eyes and ten-month follow up which showed the retina to remain completely attached in both eyes [Sisk et al 2014].
If the SMPD1 pathogenic variants in the family are known it is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early identification and treatment.

Pregnancy Management

In classic OCA1 of either type, an affected mother who is pregnant needs no exceptional consideration. Similarly, a pregnancy affected with OCA1 requires no exceptional prenatal care.
Relatives at risk for OCA2 can be identified by clinical findings (hypopigmentation and eye features); additional testing is not indicated.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

No form of classic OCA impairs fertility or compromises pregnancy or gestation.

An obligate carrier (heterozygous) fetus of a mother with OCA2 faces no additional risks over an unaffected fetus of an unaffected mother.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
If an OFD1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, it is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic female relatives (even in the absence of oral, facial, and digital anomalies) to determine if they are at risk for renal disease.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Affected pregnant women should undergo careful monitoring of their blood pressure and renal function during pregnancy.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Women with OI who have significant skeletal deformity and short stature should be followed during pregnancy by a high-risk prenatal care center.

Delivery of an infant with OI by cesarean section or by vagina has about the same rate of complications for each type of OI. Delivery of an infant with OI by cesarean section is more frequent than in the general population because a non-vertex presentation cannot be corrected by external manipulation.
The molecular genetic test method used to evaluate parents, children, and at-risk sibs of individuals with CCHS depends on the pathogenic variant identified in the proband (see Testing Strategy). Parents of children with a known PHOX2B variant should be tested for the family-specific variant to determine their risk for later-onset CCHS or mosaicism.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Though not prospectively evaluated, the ventilatory needs of a pregnant woman with CCHS warrant careful consideration by the obstetrician.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Consider molecular genetic testing for the family-specific mutation in all at-risk relatives

Because affected individuals may benefit from early evaluations for hearing loss and orthopedic complications, including scoliosis, molecular genetic testing for the family-specific mutation in all at-risk relatives should be considered.

If molecular genetic testing is not an option for an at-risk child, evaluations for hearing loss and orthopedic complications, including scoliosis, should be instituted as soon as possible after a clinical diagnosis is established in the at-risk relative.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives (both male and female) of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and/or preventive measures.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the OTC pathogenic variant in the family is known;

If prenatal testing has not been performed, it is appropriate to perform biochemical (plasma amino acid analysis, ammonia level) and molecular genetic testing on at-risk newborns (males and females) as soon after birth as possible to clarify their disease status so that the appropriate treatment or surveillance of those with the family-specific pathogenic variant can be promptly established before the child experiences a metabolic crisis.

Biochemical analysis (plasma amino acid analysis, ammonia level), an allopurinol challenge test (in older individuals), and/or OTC enzyme activity measurement in liver (males only) if the OTC pathogenic variant in the family is not known.

In general for children with neonatal-onset disease, such testing cannot be performed rapidly enough to prevent a metabolic crisis. Therefore, preventive measures at birth should be instituted until such a time as the diagnosis can be ruled out (see the description of prospective treatment in Prevention of Primary Manifestations).

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Heterozygous females are at risk of becoming catabolic during pregnancy and (especially) post partum [Redonnet-Vernhet et al 2000, Mendez-Figueroa et al 2010, Celik et al 2011, Lipskind et al 2011, Ituk et al 2012].

A symptomatic heterozygous female needs to be treated throughout pregnancy according to her pre-pregnancy protocol with adaptation for her needs during pregnancy. In the peripartum and immediate postpartum periods proactive measures to prevent catabolism include, for example, administration of a 10% dextrose solution with appropriate electrolytes at 1.5 times maintenance and addition of intralipids as needed to meet caloric requirements during these periods.

In an asymptomatic female known to be heterozygous, precautions should be taken in the peripartum and postpartum period to prevent catabolism; in addition, measurement of ammonia levels and administration of dextrose should be considered as heterozygous females have become symptomatic for the first time in the peripartum period.
It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of an individual with complete PAI-1 deficiency in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the SERPINE1 pathogenic variants in the family are known;

Measurement of PAI-1 antigen levels and PAI-1 activity if the SERPINE1 pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Recommendations based on published findings during pregnancies in two women with complete PAI-1 deficiency are administration of either tranexamic acid (25 mg kg-1 per dose, maximum 1300 milligrams, orally 3-4x/day) or epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) (100 mg kg-1 per dose, maximum 3 g, orally 4x/day) for intermittent bleeding in the first and second trimester, from 26 weeks’ gestation through delivery, and for at least two weeks post partum [Heiman et al 2014]. Note that evidence that these recommendations would be effective in all pregnancies of women with complete PAI-1 deficiency is lacking.

A woman with complete PAI-1 deficiency was treated with FFP during three pregnancies at eight to 11 weeks’ gestation two to three times per week; treatment was increased to daily at 20-28 weeks’ gestation. The first pregnancy ended in miscarriage at 19 weeks. The second and third pregnancies were delivered at 32 and 27 weeks’ gestation, respectively, as a result of uncontrollable contractions and placental abruption [Iwaki et al 2012].

Of note, the teratogenicity of EACA and tranexamic acid is unknown and information regarding their safety during pregnancy and lactation is limited. There is a need to establish dosing guidelines for the use of antifibrinolytics during pregnancy and the postpartum period.

To access further information on medication use during pregnancy, see www.mothertobaby.org.
It is recommended that relatives at risk for PRSS1-related hereditary pancreatitis be offered molecular genetic testing for the family-specific germline PRSS1 pathogenic variant (see Establishing the Diagnosis, Molecular Genetic Testing) to allow early diagnosis and prevention and/or management of symptoms [Applebaum et al 2000, Ellis et al 2001, Fink et al 2007]. Testing of children is appropriate in families with early onset symptoms. Presymptomatic testing is best performed in the context of genetic counseling [Fink et al 2007].

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

If the PAX2 pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, dilated ophthalmologic examination and renal ultrasound examination, tests of renal function, urinalysis, and blood pressure evaluation should be performed.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management 

It is important that a female who has a pathogenic variant have a thorough renal evaluation prior to becoming pregnant. Individuals with clinical renal disease should consult with appropriate professionals including nephrologists and maternal fetal medicine specialists to establish a plan for medical management during pregnancy.

Pregnancies at 50% risk for renal coloboma syndrome should be monitored for fetal renal function. Comprehensive ultrasound in the second trimester is recommended to evaluate fetal renal anatomy. Ongoing monitoring for oligohydramnios in the second and third trimesters is recommended in at-risk pregnancies.

Eighteen individuals with pathogenic variants have been reported to have prenatal ultrasound abnormalities including oligohydramnios/anhydramnios, cystic renal dysplasia, multicystic dysplastic kidneys, and renal hypoplasia [Bower et al 2012]. Seven fetuses with a confirmed PAX2 pathogenic variant and severe prenatal renal failure (Potter sequence) have been reported [Martinovic-Bouriel et al 2010, Bower et al 2012]. In addition, four cases of severe prenatal renal failure have been reported in families with renal coloboma syndrome in which the presence of the familial pathogenic variant could not be verified in the affected fetus [Ford et al 2001, Bower et al 2012]. In several instances, parents with mild renal disease had pregnancies where the fetus presented with severe renal disease in utero.
Because early diagnosis and treatment is very likely to change the outcome for individuals (especially in the context of SDHB pathogenic variants, which portend aggressive disease), it is recommended that relatives at risk be offered genetic testing as early as possible when the family pathogenic variant is known.

By age ten years or at least ten years before the earliest age at diagnosis in the family, presymptomatic testing, including genetic testing, should be offered to all first-degree relatives of an individual in whom a pathogenic variant in SDHA, SDHB,

SDHC, and SDHD, SDHAF2, or MAX has been detected.

Use of molecular genetic testing for early identification of at-risk family members improves diagnostic certainty and reduces the need for costly screening procedures in those at-risk family members who have not inherited a pathogenic variant. Early detection of tumors can facilitate surgical removal, decrease related morbidity, and potentially result in removal prior to malignant transformation or metastasis [Young et al 2002]:

In families with a previously identified pathogenic variant, relatives who do not have the family-specific pathogenic variant are spared the cost and anxiety associated with regular clinical, biochemical, and imaging studies.

Family members who have the family-specific pathogenic variant can be informed of their heightened risks for paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas and encouraged to undergo biochemical and imaging studies as described in Surveillance.

Note: Identification of the pathogenic variant (or the absence thereof) in an affected individual is essential for interpretation of negative molecular genetic test results in an at-risk asymptomatic relative.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

There are no published consensus management guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hereditary PGL/PCC during pregnancy. A high index of suspicion for these tumors in pregnant women is indicated, since there are other more common causes of hypertension during pregnancy (e.g., pre-eclampsia). Secretory PGLs/PCCs are more likely to present at any time during pregnancy (whereas pre-eclampsia is more common in the second or third trimester) and are typically not associated with weight gain, edema, proteinuria or thrombocytopenia. Individuals with PGLs/PCCs are more likely to present with palpitations, sweating pallor, orthostatic hypotension, and glucosuria, and the hypertension may be episodic.

A 24-hour urine collection for fractionated metanephrines and catecholamines should be used as a first-line test, as there is little experience with the use of plasma fractionated metanephrines during pregnancy. MRI without gadolinium administration should be the first-line test used to localize the tumor, since CT will expose the fetus to radiation. Radioisotope imaging studies should be deferred until after pregnancy in non-lactating mothers for similar reasons.

Surgery is the definitive treatment for these tumors, with appropriate alpha-adrenergic, and if needed, subsequent beta-adrenergic blockade to prevent a hypertensive crisis. Phenoxybenzamine is the alpha blocker of choice in both pregnant and non-pregnant individuals with catecholamine-secreting tumors [Reisch et al 2006]. For intra-abdominal PGL/PCC, a laparoscopic surgical approach is ideal if the tumor size allows. After 24 weeks gestation, surgery may need to be delayed until fetal maturity is reached (~34 weeks) because of problems with tumor accessibility. An open surgical approach combined with elective C-section may need to be performed in these situations. A good outcome has only been described with vaginal delivery in select cases [Junglee et al 2007].

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy of a fetus with PCH2 carries no special risk to the mother. No treatment for the condition is available. In the last trimester cerebellar development lags, which can be followed by measuring transverse cerebellar diameter. Birth is usually normal and uncomplicated; problems usually arise shortly after birth with irritability and impaired swallowing, often necessitating gavage feeding.

Pregnancy of a fetus with PCH4 may lead to polyhydramnios due to impaired fetal swallowing. Fetal akinesia often causes congenital contractures. Intrauterine clonus may be perceived by the mother through the uterine wall. Clonus persists after birth and is usually severe. Absence of respiratory movement necessitates mechanical support at birth.
Molecular genetic testing of at-risk relatives in a family with PC is not indicated because the phenotype is readily observed from a young age and no interventions can prevent the development of manifestations or reduce their severity.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Increased risk to the fetus during pregnancy has not been reported.

For a pregnant woman with PC, weight gain (increasing stress on the plantar surface) or altered hormonal environment during pregnancy may worsen the painful plantar keratoderma.
It is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known, a rigorous clinical history and physical examination accompanied by chest imaging and nasal nitric oxide measurements can be used to clarify the disease status of at-risk sibs.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

For a female with PCD, any pulmonary infections and pulmonary functional status should be rigorously evaluated by an expert in PCD (or cystic fibrosis) to define the risk associated with child bearing.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy in a woman with PC deficiency has not been reported. However, women with the benign form (type C) could become pregnant; such a pregnancy should be closely monitored for any metabolic derangements including dehydration and acidosis.
Empiric treatment of the affected individual’s newborn sib with pyridoxine supplementation should be offered until testing has been completed.

If the ALDH7A1 pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing is appropriate.

If the pathogenic variants are not known, the following is recommended:

If a younger sib of a proband presents with encephalopathy or a seizure, pyridoxine should be administered acutely (ideally under EEG monitoring) for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

α-AASA is a sensitive biomarker for pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy while pipecolic acid is an indirect and less sensitive biomarker. If elevated plasma biomarker concentrations have been demonstrated in the proband, a similar elevation in a younger sib would support a diagnosis of pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy.

Note: It would be unlikely for the proband's older sibs who have not experienced seizures to be pyridoxine dependent.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

As recurrence risk for couples who have a child with this disorder is 25%, there is justification to treat the mother empirically with supplemental pyridoxine at a dose of 50-100 mg/day throughout the last half of her subsequent pregnancies and to treat the newborn with supplemental pyridoxine to prevent seizures and reduce the risk of neurodevelopmental disability [Baxter & Aicardi 1999, Bok et al 2010a]. It is important to emphasize, however, that at least one severe phenotype has been described in a family in which prenatal treatment of an at-risk sib did not result in an improved neurodevelopmental outcome [Rankin et al 2007].

Molecular genetic testing of ALDH7A1 can be performed prenatally or after birth; if both pathogenic variants are present, pyridoxine treatment should be continued during pregnancy (if prenatal testing is pursued and reveals the fetus to be affected) and after birth; if not, treatment can be withdrawn.
It is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and measures to minimize risk in the event of seizure onset (e.g., avoidance of unattended swimming).

If the LGI1 or RELN pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, interview of relatives at risk may identify symptoms possibly related to seizures.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
At-risk relatives should be evaluated for hearing loss, vestibular dysfunction, and thyroid abnormality in the same manner as an affected individual at initial diagnosis.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing of sibs is indicated shortly after birth so that appropriate and early support and management can be provided to the child and family.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from treatment and preventive measures (e.g., early intervention in young children with profound hearing loss, estrogen replacement to facilitate pubertal development, and potential oocyte cryopreservation if primary ovarian insufficiency is considered). See Treatment of Manifestations.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known, screening of siblings should be arranged to include audiologic assessment in males and females and baseline serum measurements of LH and FSH in females.

It is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk in order to identify as early as

possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic

testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, simple screening

tests have been found to be sensitive for establishing the diagnosis in

relatives at risk [Watters et al 1986, Hartley et al 1994] and

prognosis of pulmonary fibrosis [Watters et al 1986, Schwartz et al

1994a, Schwartz et al 1994b].

It is recommended that every five years, asymptomatic

first-degree relatives (of individuals with FPF) older than age

50 years undergo pulmonary function tests, obtain an HRCT scan

of the chest to detect early abnormalities, and complete a

standardized questionnaire to assess the presence of respiratory

symptoms.

Family members are considered to have a positive screening

evaluation (i.e., to possibly have pulmonary fibrosis) if they

have at least class 2 dyspnea (breathlessness when hurrying on a

level surface or walking up a slight hill), a DLCO

below 80% of predicted, or presence of at least ILO category 1

findings on chest x-ray [International Labour Office 2011]. Family members

who have a positive screen require further evaluation (see Diagnosis).

A study of asymptomatic at-risk family members in a FPF cohort by Kropski et al

[2015] identified more than 25% of subjects with subtle

radiologic and histopathologic abnormalities suggestive of possible

early interstitial lung disease. It is unknown if these findings would

become symptomatic FPF in the subjects.

See Genetic

Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for

genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those with PFCP who would benefit from education regarding agents and circumstances to avoid and inappropriate treatments. Evaluations can include the following:

If the EPOR pathogenic variant in the family is known. Molecular genetic testing

If no pathogenic variant has been identified in the family. Blood count and serum EPO concentration if hemoglobin and hematocrit are increased

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

No information is available on the management of pregnancy in a woman with PFCP.

Although the only survey of pregnancy in women with congenital erythrocytosis did not include any women with an EPOR pathogenic variant, data showed that when treated with low-dose aspirin and phlebotomy to reduce the hematocrit to a suitable level, women with erythrocytosis can have normal pregnancies and give birth to healthy children [McMullin et al 2015].
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Consideration should be given to testing asymptomatic at-risk family members in order to plan early treatment, monitoring, and preventive intervention [Cochat et al 2012]. If the AGXT pathogenic variants in the family are known, the affected/carrier status of at-risk family members can be confirmed by molecular genetic testing. The benefits of early initiation of conservative measures cannot be ignored [Chand & Kaskel 2009, Fargue et al 2009, Martín et al 2011].

Asymptomatic individuals:

Can be monitored periodically for renal function and urinary oxalate;

Should maintain adequate hydration and avoid high-oxalate foods.

In addition:

Potassium citrate administration may also be considered as an aid to reducing calcium oxalate excretion [Leumann & Hoppe 2001].

For those with the pathogenic variant p.Gly170Arg or p.Phe152Ile, pyridoxine should be supplemented.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy does not appear to be an important risk factor for the development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the majority of women with PH1 [Norby & Milliner 2004]; however, women in whom renal function deteriorated during the pregnancy and remained abnormal post-delivery have been reported [Cimino et al 2005].

Of particular note, pregnant women with PH1 warrant close monitoring during pregnancy by both an obstetrician and nephrologist because of the increased risk of developing nephrolithiasis after delivery.
In order to delay disease onset in asymptomatic relatives, it is prudent to screen at-risk family members before symptoms occur by measuring urinary oxalate excretion or by molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known. Molecular genetic testing tends to be more reliable as urine oxalate output can be variable in childhood.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Using molecular genetic testing for the HOGA1 pathogenic variants found in the proband, it is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early treatment and preventive measures.

Urine oxalate should be measured in all sibs who are affected (i.e., have biallelic HOGA1 pathogenic variants) or who are carriers (i.e., heterozygous for one HOGA1 pathogenic variant)

Any sib with elevated urine oxalate/creatinine ratio or elevated oxalate excretion rate corrected for 1.73 m2 BSA should undergo kidney ultrasound examination, measurement of plasma oxalate concentration, a baseline 24-hour urine collection with a supersaturation profile, and measurement of serum creatinine concentration (see Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis).

See Genetic Counselling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

There have been no studies of pregnancy in women with PH3. However, most women with PH1 or PH2 who had good kidney function during pregnancy have done well and have delivered healthy infants [Norby & Milliner 2004].

Adequate fluid intake should be maintained throughout the pregnancy. Circumstances that compromise fluid intake, such as hyperemesis gravidarum, should prompt early initiation of IV fluid to maintain adequate hydration.

Stones that become symptomatic during pregnancy may require routine (but specialized) techniques for management.

In patients with stones, urinary tract infections should be treated promptly and thoroughly due to the potential for bacteria to cause pyelonephritis or infect stones and complicate management.
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment. Evaluations can include:

Measurement of serum potassium concentration and blood pressure;

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family is known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

During the pregnancy of a woman with PHAII, electrolytes and blood pressure should be monitored regularly and blood pressure medication adjusted as needed.

Some antihypertensive medications (including thiazide diuretics) have been associated with adverse fetal outcome, especially when taken during the first trimester of pregnancy. The best time to discuss the risk to the fetus associated with a maternal medication is prior to conception. Women with PHAII who become pregnant should be referred to an obstetrics group with expertise in high risk pregnancies.

To access further information on medication use in pregnancy, visit www.mothertobaby.org.
It is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, clinical examination for polydactyly, laryngoscopy for bifid epiglottis, or MRI for hypothalamic hamartoma can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

The first-degree relative of a proband is considered affected if hypothalamic hamartoma or central or postaxial polydactyly are present in the relative. (Postaxial polydactyly type B can be used as a diagnostic criterion for first-degree relatives only in persons who are not of central African descent.)

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy management of a woman affected with PHS should be attuned to guidelines for the specific manifestations of the disorder. For example, the management of pregnant women with gelastic epilepsy who need to take anticonvulsants is challenging. As there are no guidelines specific to PHS, the author recommends following general guidelines for anticonvulsants in pregnancy [Borthen & Gilhus 2012].

In general, women with epilepsy or a seizure disorder from any cause are at greater risk for mortality during pregnancy than pregnant women without a seizure disorder; use of antiepileptic medication during pregnancy reduces this risk. However, exposure to antiepileptic medication may increase the risk for adverse fetal outcome (depending on the drug used, the dose, and the stage of pregnancy at which medication is taken). Nevertheless, the risk of an adverse outcome to the fetus from antiepileptic medication exposure is often less than that associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Therefore, use of antiepileptic medication to treat a maternal seizure disorder during pregnancy is typically recommended. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given antiepileptic drug during pregnancy should ideally take place prior to conception. Transitioning to a lower-risk medication prior to pregnancy may be possible [Sarma et al 2016].

The management of fertility and pregnancy (which is uncommon in individuals with hypopituitarism) in individuals with hypopituitarism caused by PHS is similarly challenging and again, it is recommended that general guidelines be followed [Kübler et al 2009].

See MotherToBaby for further information on medication use during pregnancy.
When a PTEN pathogenic variant has been identified in a proband, testing of asymptomatic at-risk relatives can identify those who have the family-specific pathogenic variant and, therefore, have PHTS. These individuals are in need of initial evaluation and ongoing surveillance.

Molecular testing is appropriate for at-risk individuals younger than age 18 years, given the possible early disease presentation in individuals with BRRS and Proteus syndrome. In individuals with PHTS, the earliest documented breast cancer and thyroid cancer are at age 17 years and before age nine years, respectively.

Relatives who have not inherited the PTEN pathogenic variant found in an affected relative do not have PHTS or its associated cancer risks.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Owing to the absence of preventive treatment or measures, presymptomatic genetic diagnosis is not medically justified.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

There are no reports specifically addressing pregnancy management in women with PINK1 type Parkinson disease. However, in general, pregnancy may either exacerbate or improve symptoms of Parkinson disease [Shulman et al 2000, Scott & Chowdhury 2005]. L-dopa crosses the placenta and (theoretically) may have an adverse effect on fetal development, as some animal models have shown that high doses of L-dopa administered during pregnancy may induce stillbirth and birth defects including skeletal malformations [Scott & Chowdhury 2005]. However, based on more than 30 cases recorded in the literature levodopa treatment during human pregnancy has not resulted in adverse fetal outcome [Scott & Chowdhury 2005].
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is known, it is appropriate to offer molecular genetic testing for the known pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant to at-risk relatives. Morbidity and mortality can be reduced in those individuals identified to have the family-specific variant by means of:

Early diagnosis and treatment;

Surveillance as outlined in Surveillance.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, it is appropriate to offer:

Clinical diagnostic evaluations to identify those family members who will benefit from early treatment;

Surveillance as outlined in Surveillance to all first-degree relatives whether or not they meet diagnostic criteria.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Related Genetic Counseling Issues.
The initial evaluation of at-risk relatives over age 18 years should be imaging with abdominal ultrasound examination, CT, or MRI. When the findings on imaging are equivocal or if the pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing may be appropriate.

Presymptomatic diagnosis:

Allows those found to be affected to become better educated about the disease;

Permits early detection and treatment of complications and associated disorders;

Reassures those found to be unaffected.

A molecular diagnosis provides information for family planning choices, including PGD.

Note: (1) Appropriate counseling prior to imaging or molecular testing, including a discussion of the possible impact on insurability and employability, is most important. (2) At present, there is no indication for testing of asymptomatic children. This may change in the future, if and when effective therapies are developed.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

The literature on pregnancy and PKD is limited.

Pregnant women with ADPKD should be monitored closely for the development of hypertension and urinary tract infections.

Pregnant women who develop hypertension during pregnancy or who have impaired renal function are at increased risk and should be monitored closely for the development of preeclampsia, intrauterine fetal growth restriction, and oligohydramnios.

A second-trimester prenatal sonographic examination is indicated if either parent has ADPKD to assess fetal kidney size and echogenicity, presence of fetal kidney cysts, and amniotic fluid volume [Vora et al 2008].
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of a proband/in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known;

High-resolution renal and hepatic ultrasonographic evaluation and monitoring of systemic blood pressure if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnant women who are on anticonvulsants therapy for PKD are recommended to take folic acid 5 mg/day. Because of the risk of teratogenic effects related to anticonvulsants, women with mild symptoms related to PKD may wish to consider discontinuing anticonvulsant therapy during pregnancy.
It is appropriate to evaluate sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment. Note: Because phenotypic variability may be significant, previously undiagnosed and even apparently asymptomatic sibs of an affected individual may also be affected [Vockley et al 2014].

Evaluations can include:

Measurement of blood concentration of phenylalanine and newborn screening in newborn sibs of an individual with PKU if prenatal testing was not done;

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known;

Blood concentration of phenylalanine and tyrosine to clarify the disease status of older at-risk sibs if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Women with PAH Deficiency

Women with PAH deficiency who have received appropriate treatment throughout childhood and adolescence have normal physical and essentially normal intellectual and behavioral development. However, if the woman has elevated plasma Phe concentrations during pregnancy, the fetus is at high risk for malformations and intellectual disability, since phenylalanine is a potent teratogen (see Clinical Characteristics) [Rouse & Azen 2004, Prick et al 2012].

The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology Committee Opinion on the Management of Women with Phenylketonuria, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines on the diagnosis and management of PAH deficiency [Vockley et al 2014], and Singh et al [2014] suggest the following management of an affected woman prior to and during pregnancy.

Preconception

Genetic counseling regarding the teratogenic effects of elevated maternal Phe concentration on the developing fetus and recurrence risks for PAH deficiency in the fetus

Achievement and maintenance of the maternal Phe concentration at less than 360 µmol/L for three months prior to conception

Assessment of early osteopenia risk

Discontinuation of LNAA treatment

During pregnancy

Co-monitor in conjunction with practitioners from an experienced metabolic center.

Maternal Phe concentration of 120-360 µmol/L during pregnancy is recommended. In unplanned pregnancies, rapid re-initiation of a Phe-restricted diet should be advised based on current knowledge of the fetal risks.

Despite limited data, sapropterin supplementation may be appropriate in addition to dietary therapy.

Monitor dietary intake of pregnant women with PAH deficiency to ensure nutrient adequacy with proper proportion of protein, fat, and carbohydrates.

Evaluate for fetal anomalies by high resolution ultrasound and fetal echocardiogram.

Post partum

Provide coordinated care in the post-partum period

Breast feeding may be pursued if the infant does not have PAH deficiency.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnant women who are on anticonvulsants therapy for PNKD are recommended to take folic acid 5 mg/day. Because of the risk of teratogenic effects related to anticonvulsants, women with mild symptoms related to PNKD may consider discontinuing anticonvulsant therapy during pregnancy.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Anecdotally, ataxia may sometimes appear for the first time or worsen during pregnancy. Note: While some individuals with ataxia report a worsening of coordination after general anesthesia, no increased risk has been reported specifically with obstetric anesthesia.

Spasticity generally does not change significantly with pregnancy.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, prenatal testing can clarify the genetic status of at-risk pregnancies so that glucocorticoid therapy can be initiated as soon as possible after birth in those newborns known to have POMC deficiency.

If POMC deficiency has been previously diagnosed in a family member, and if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known or if prenatal testing has not been performed, it is necessary to evaluate any at-risk newborn (e.g., sibs of a proband) for evidence of adrenal insufficiency and to initiate glucocorticoid therapy as soon as possible if adrenal insufficiency is found.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Testing at-risk relatives of an individual with F-PCT to identify those with a UROD pathogenic variant is not expected to alter their management due to the low risk of development of the signs and symptoms of PCT. Nevertheless, if the family-specific UROD pathogenic variant is known, it is reasonable to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives so that those with a UROD pathogenic variant can avoid known susceptibility factors.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy is generally not complicated by F-PCT. Women with active F-PCT should be able to carry pregnancies to term [Aziz Ibrahim & Esen 2004, Tollanes et al 2011].

It is recommended that women with F-PCT be treated prior to the onset of planned pregnancies.
At-risk family members can be offered molecular genetic testing for the family-specific PPOX pathogenic variant to identify PPOX heterozygotes for counseling regarding appropriate use of drugs and avoidance of known precipitating factors.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
If the germline DICER1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, it is reasonable to offer molecular genetic testing to at-risk relatives of all ages to clarify their genetic status and to provide recommendations for age-appropriate surveillance and early intervention.

If first-degree relatives are not able to undergo molecular genetic testing, surveillance should be based on clinical changes that would warrant further investigation as detailed above (see Surveillance).

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Although large lung cysts in the fetus can theoretically impair lung development, such an occurrence appears to be uncommon. According to the IPPBR, prenatal ultrasound examination has detected lung cysts in seven cases at 31-35 weeks’ gestational age.

Because large lung cysts can cause respiratory distress in newborns, it is recommended that prenatal identification of lung cysts prompt consultation with specialists in high-risk obstetrics and fetal medicine to monitor the pregnancy and manage the delivery.
It is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

The WHO Symposia [Badesch et al 2009] recommends serial screening by echocardiography of at-risk family members every three to five years to enable earlier detection and treatment. However, many health insurers do not provide coverage for screening tests for asymptomatic individuals. No studies describe the frequency of compliance with the WHO recommendation.

In families with a known pathogenic variant in one of the genes known to be associated with HPAH, the use of molecular genetic testing to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives can allow individuals who do not have the family-specific pathogenic variant to safely forego clinical screening. However, the role of molecular genetic testing for early diagnosis of at-risk family members has yet to be established [Newman et al 2001].

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

The physiologic stress of pregnancy in a woman with HPAH is significant and maternal mortality is believed to be substantial; newer effective therapies may decrease the risk.

Anecdotal reports of onset of PAH with pregnancy raise concern about risks of pregnancy as a basis for developing PAH, but no consensus exists regarding the best approach to birth control in women with HPAH [Austin et al 2009a, Sweeney & Voelkel 2009].
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Deformities of pelvis may necessitate delivery by cæsarean section in pregnant women who have PPD.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

No cases of pregnant women affected with prion disease have been documented; if such a situation were to arise, clinical judgment regarding the safety and viability of the fetus and the life expectancy of the mother (which can be estimated based on the pathogenic variant and time of onset of symptoms) should be used in determining the best course of action during the pregnancy.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
If both (paternal and maternal) PROP1 pathogenic variants are identified in a proband, it is appropriate to perform molecular genetic testing on younger sibs to enable early diagnosis and treatment.

For younger sibs who have not undergone molecular genetic testing, monitoring growth for evidence of growth failure is appropriate. Of note, affected sibs usually have extreme short stature because of thyroid hormone deficiency and growth hormone deficiency.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Testing of at-risk sibs is warranted to allow for early diagnosis and treatment. If prenatal testing has not been performed on at-risk sibs, measure urine organic acids, plasma amino acids, and acylcarnitine profile immediately in the newborn period in parallel with newborn screening.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Although successful pregnancy outcomes have been reported in patients with PA [Van Calcar et al 1992, Langendonk et al 2012], pregnancy can pose a significant management challenge. Hyperemesis gravidarum may require the use of an antiemetic but the risk of QT interval prolongation and the effect on the central nervous system need to be considered [Baumgartner et al 2014]. Baseline evaluation and monitoring of cardiomyopathy before, during, and after pregnancy is recommended. Reference ranges for total and free plasma carnitine differ during pregnancy [Schoderbeck et al 1995]. Close nutritional follow up and fetal growth monitoring is necessary as the energy and protein requirements change throughout pregnancy. Close post-partum clinical and biochemical follow up and delayed discharge from the hospital are recommended. In the post-partum period, increased caloric and protein needs during lactation should be taken into consideration.
Because PS is not inherited, relatives are not at increased risk and do not require evaluation.
It is appropriate to screen apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives (regardless of gender) of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

Evaluations include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant in the family is known;

If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, measurement of serum urate concentration; 24-hour urinary uric acid excretion or spot urine uric acid/creatinine ratio; and an audiology evaluation. Note: (1) Because collection of 24-hour urine in an infant or young child is very difficult, measurement of uric acid/creatinine ratio in a spot urine sample may be helpful. (2) Sometimes the serum urate concentrations are not extremely elevated in children with PRS superactivity, probably as a result of higher renal clearance of urate, however the urine urate excretion is abnormally high for age in all individuals.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is recommended that relatives at risk for PRSS1-related hereditary pancreatitis be offered molecular genetic testing for the family-specific germline PRSS1 pathogenic variant to allow early diagnosis and prevention and/or management of symptoms [Applebaum et al 2000, Ellis et al 2001, Fink et al 2007]. Testing of children is appropriate in families with early onset symptoms. Presymptomatic testing is best performed in the context of genetic counseling [Fink et al 2007].

Pregnancy Management

For females with pseudoachondroplasia, delivery by cesarean section is often necessary because of the small size of the pelvis.
The genetic status of asymptomatic at-risk family members can be established using molecular genetic testing. However, as there is no clinical evidence that early diagnosis reduces morbidity or mortality, the indications for family testing are unresolved and the decision to test at-risk family members should be made on an individual basis [Segal et al 2009].

Clarification of 20210G>A allele status may be useful in:

Asymptomatic adult family members of probands with one or two known 20210G>A alleles, especially those with a strong family history of VTE at a young age;

Asymptomatic female family members of probands with known prothrombin-related thrombophilia who are pregnant or considering estrogen contraception or pregnancy.

There is no clinical evidence to support testing asymptomatic children with a family history of thrombosis and/or inherited thrombophilia. Guidelines suggest delaying testing until children are able to understand the implications of the results and (optimally) can give informed consent for testing [Chalmers et al 2011].

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

No consensus exists on the optimal management of prothrombin thrombophilia during pregnancy; guidelines are derived from studies in non-pregnant individuals [Kujovich 2004a, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 2009, Baglin et al 2010, Bates et al 2012, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 2013b]; see Published Guidelines/Consensus Statements. LMWH is the preferred antithrombotic agent for prophylaxis during pregnancy. All women with inherited thrombophilia should undergo individualized risk assessment. Decisions about anticoagulation should be based on the number and type of thrombophilic defects, coexisting risk factors, and personal and family history of thrombosis [Bates et al 2012, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 2013b].

Prophylactic anticoagulation during pregnancy:

Is recommended for all women:

With a history of unprovoked VTE, including those heterozygous for 20210G>A. LMWH should be given during pregnancy followed by six weeks of postpartum anticoagulation [Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 2009, Baglin et al 2010, Bates et al 2012, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 2013b].

Heterozygous for the 20210G>A allele with a prior pregnancy or estrogen-related thrombosis who are also at an increased risk for recurrence [Pabinger et al 2005, De Stefano et al 2006, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 2009, Baglin et al 2010, Bates et al 2012, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 2013b].

Should be considered for:

Asymptomatic women doubly heterozygous for 20210G>A and factor V Leiden, especially those with coexisting circumstantial risk factors (obesity, immobilization, multiple gestation) [Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 2009, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 2013b];

Asymptomatic homozygous women with a family history of thrombosis [Bates et al 2012, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 2013b].

Is not routinely recommended in asymptomatic heterozygous women with no history of thrombosis or other risk factors. These women should be counseled about potential thrombotic complications during pregnancy and the postpartum period [Bates et al 2012, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 2013b].

In two large prospective studies, low-risk asymptomatic women with thrombophilia (including 20210G>A heterozygosity) did not receive LMWH during pregnancy in the absence of additional risk factors. All women received a course of postpartum anticoagulation. The low incidence of antepartum VTE in both studies (0% and 0.34%) suggested that anticoagulation may be safely withheld during pregnancy in low-risk 20210G>A heterozygotes who do not have other risk factors [Bauersachs et al 2007, Dargaud et al 2009].

A six-week course of postpartum prophylactic anticoagulation is recommended for:

Heterozygous women with a positive family history of VTE or other additional risk factors;

All asymptomatic homozygous women;

All women with a prior history of VTE [Bates et al 2012, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 2013b].

Prevention of pregnancy loss. It is still unkown if prophylactic antithrombotic therapy improves pregnancy outcome in women with inherited thrombophilia and recurrent pregnancy loss. The available evidence consists of predominantly uncontrolled trials, observational studies, and a few randomized trials with important methodologic limitations. There are no prospective randomized trials that include an untreated control group that confirms the benefit of LMWH for preventing pregnancy loss in women with inherited thrombophilia. Of note, the ALIFE2 study, a multicenter randomized trial of LMWH versus standard surveillance in women with inherited thrombophilia and a history of recurrent miscarriage, began recruitment in December 2012 (www.trialregister.nl, NTR 3361).

Current consensus guidelines and expert opinion recommend against the use of antithrombotic therapy in women with inherited thrombophilia and unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss outside of clinical trials because of the absence of high quality evidence confirming benefit [Baglin et al 2010, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 2011a, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 2011b, Bates et al 2012, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 2013b, Middeldorp 2013].

Studies suggesting that prophylactic anticoagulation improves pregnancy outcome:

The results of several observational studies suggested that prophylactic antithrombotic therapy may improve pregnancy outcome in women with inherited thrombophilia and recurrent pregnancy loss [Brenner et al 2000, Carp et al 2003].

A recent study of women with a history of unexplained pregnancy loss compared the frequency of obstetric complications in women with factor V Leiden or 20210G>A alleles and women without thrombophilia. Women with a thrombophilic disorder with a prior fetal loss after ten weeks’ gestation who received enoxaparin during their next pregnancy had a significantly lower rate of fetal loss and severe preeclampsia and a higher rate of live births compared to women without a thrombophilic disorder with the same obstetric history who did not receive prophylaxis [Bouvier et al 2014].

A prospective randomized trial compared prophylactic-dose enoxaparin and low-dose aspirin in women heterozygous for 20210G>A, factor V Leiden, or protein S deficiency, and a history of a single unexplained fetal loss after ten weeks’ gestation. Enoxaparin prophylaxis was associated with a significantly higher live birth rate of 86% compared to 29% with aspirin. However, there were methodologic problems with this study and the results have not been confirmed in other trials.

Studies suggesting that prophylactic anticoagulation does not improve pregnancy outcome:

Several studies found no benefit with LMWH on pregnancy outcome in women with inherited thrombophilia [Laskin et al 2009, Warren et al 2009, Visser et al 2011].

Two recent randomized trials compared the efficacy of LMWH and aspirin to no antithrombotic therapy or placebo in women with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss. Combined LMWH and low-dose aspirin did not increase the live birth rate in either study [Clark et al 2010, Kaandorp et al 2010]. Because only a small proportion of the study populations had inherited thrombophilia (3.5% and 15.7%), subgroup analyses were insufficiently powered to assess the effect of antithrombotic therapy.

In the recent Thrombophilia in Pregnancy Prophylaxis Study (TIPPS) multinational randomized trial, antepartum prophylactic LMWH did not reduce the incidence of pregnancy loss or placenta-mediated complications in pregnant women with thrombophilia (22% with a 20210G>A allele) who are at high risk for these complications [Rodger et al 2014].

Other pregnancy complications. Data supporting the benefit of antithrombotic therapy in women with inherited thrombophilia and other pregnancy complications are considerably more limited and also conflicting [Gris et al 2011, de Vries et al 2012, Martinelli et al 2012]. There is insufficient evidence that LMWH (with or without aspirin) reduces the risk for preeclampsia, placental abruption, or other obstetric complications in women with or without inherited thrombophilia. Current guidelines recommend against antithrombotic prophylaxis for women with inherited thrombophilia and a history of pregnancy complications [Baglin et al 2010, Bates et al 2012, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 2013b].

Pregnancy Management

In the series of Bercovitch et al [2004], there was no statistically significant effect of gravidity on the severity of skin, eye, cardiac, or peripheral vascular manifestations of PXE in women over 40. In addition, women over 40 with PXE who had been pregnant did not have more severe skin, cardiac, ocular, or vascular manifestations of PXE than those who had never been pregnant. Except for the consequences of severe maternal gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which appears to be uncommon, PXE has no known significant effect on the fetus. Retinal examination during pregnancy and prompt attention to any visual symptoms are advised.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

The pregnancy of a woman should be monitored for symptoms of RDP, onset of which has followed childbirth in some (not all) women who are heterozygous for an ATP1A3 pathogenic variant.

In principle, abortion or caesarean section could be sufficiently stressful to also be a trigger.
Clarification of the genetic status of at-risk relatives is appropriate in order to allow early diagnosis and treatment of AVMs/AVFs to reduce/avoid secondary adverse outcomes. In particular, at-risk infants are candidates for prompt diagnosis given the possible early presentation of neurologic complications from intracranial AVMs/AVFs [Revencu et al 2008].

It is appropriate to evaluate sibs of a proband before symptoms of Refsum disease occur in order to institute early treatment to reduce plasma phytanic acid concentration. Evaluations include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known;

Measurement of phytanic acid concentration in plasma or serum if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Because of the tendency for pregnancy to induce catabolism, it is extremely important to manage plasma phytanic acid concentration during pregnancy in women with Refsum disease.

Fairly rapid reduction of visual fields has been observed during the third trimester of pregnancy [BP Leroy, unpublished observations], possibly due to increased plasma phytanic acid concentration resulting from increased catabolism.
The American Society of Clinical Oncologists identifies heritable retinoblastoma as a Group 1 disorder, i.e., a hereditary syndrome for which genetic testing is considered part of the standard management for at-risk family members [American Society of Clinical Oncology 2003]. It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from eye examination by an experienced ophthalmologist and allow for early identification of a retinoblastoma.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant in the family is known, which reduces the need for costly screening procedures in those at-risk family members who have not inherited the pathogenic variant [Noorani et al 1996, Richter et al 2003];

Eye examinations by an ophthalmologist experienced in the treatment of retinoblastoma starting directly after birth as described above (see Surveillance, Detection of subsequent Rb after initial diagnosis. Young or uncooperative children may require examination under anesthesia.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate at-risk male relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from institution of treatment and preventive measures.

If the RS1 pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, examination by an ophthalmologist can be used to clarify the affected status of at-risk relatives for early treatment of retinal detachment.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
When the SLC52A2 or SLC52A3 pathogenic variants in the family are known, it is appropriate to perform molecular genetic testing on the older and younger sibs of a proband with riboflavin transporter deficiency neuronopathy to identify as early as possible those with biallelic pathogenic variants who would benefit from early treatment with riboflavin supplementation and monitoring for potential complications of the disorder.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Females who have riboflavin transporter deficiency neuronopathy with biallelic pathogenic variants in either SLC52A2 or SLC52A3 should take riboflavin supplements before and during pregnancy and when breast feeding to avoid inducing riboflavin deficiency in the fetus and infant. Recommended doses during pregnancy are 10 mg/kg/day.

Few studies have evaluated for adverse fetal outcome after excessive maternal riboflavin intake during pregnancy. Riboflavin deficiency during pregnancy, however, has been associated with an increased risk of maternal preeclampsia and preterm delivery [Wacker et al 2000, Carmichael et al 2013].

Note: Although no data are available, the authors recommend a diet rich in riboflavin during pregnancy for females who are heterozygous for a pathogenic variant in either SLC52A2 or SLC52A3 as it is unknown if they are at increased risk of developing symptoms due to an increased demand for riboflavin during pregnancy.
Testing of at-risk infants and children is warranted to ensure early diagnosis and early treatment for optimal outcome.

Evaluation can be accomplished by:

Molecular genetic testing if the PHEX pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member;

Biochemical testing consisting of serum phosphorus, creatinine, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, intact parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D], and 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D concentrations and urine phosphorus and creatinine concentrations. Infants with initially normal test results require reevaluation every two to three months until at least age one year.

No role has been established for screening asymptomatic adult family members.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

No data on the use of phosphate and calcitriol in pregnant women with XLH are available. Most women with XLH who are on active therapy at the time of conception are continued on treatment throughout the pregnancy with vigilant monitoring of urinary calcium-to-creatinine ratios to detect hypercalciuria early in order to modify treatment accordingly. Those individuals who are not on therapy at the time of conception are generally not started on treatment during pregnancy.
It is appropriate to evaluate the sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from institution of treatment and surveillance. If the WNT5A or DVL1 pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy in affected women appears to be generally uncomplicated. For an affected fetus, cæsarean section may be required for abnormal presentation and/or cephalopelvic disproportion. Breech presentation requiring cæsarean section has been reported in one case of ADRS [Roifman et al 2015].

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

No special pregnancy management issues from the perspective of an affected mother and/or from the perspective of an affected fetus are known.

Of note, during pregnancy the hyperbilirubinemia of Rotor syndrome may complicate the diagnosis and management of liver disease related to pregnancy (e.g., intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy) and liver disease not related to pregnancy.
If the pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member, it is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives so that those who harbor the pathogenic variant(s) can (1) undergo timely routine surveillance for disease complications and (2) avoid possible precipitating factors.

Presymptomatic diagnosis of at-risk relatives followed by treatment is necessary to prevent syncope and sudden death in those individuals who have inherited the pathogenic variant and/or have ECG findings consistent with LQTS. At-risk family members should be alerted to their risk and the need to be evaluated.

Relatives at high potential risk for LQTS who require further testing include members of a family:

That has documented LQTS;

In which evaluation for LQTS has not been performed.

Presymptomatic diagnosis for at-risk asymptomatic family members can be performed by one

or both of the following:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant in the family is known

If the pathogenic variant is not known or if genetic testing is not possible, QTc analysis on resting and in case of normal QTc also QTc analysis on exercise ECGsNote: The diagnostic accuracy by QTc analysis is considerably improved by evaluation of the exercise ECG QTc intervals, in addition to the resting ECG, using the QTc values listed in Table 1.

Relatives at low potential risk who do not require further testing include members of a family in which the connecting ancestor:

Has a low probability of LQTS based on QTc interval (see Table 1) and has not experienced LQTS-type events; or

Has a normal QTc interval and no evidence of a pathogenic variant in one of the genes known to cause LQTS; or

Does not have the family-specific pathogenic variant, if known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

The post-partum period is associated with increased risk for a cardiac event, especially in individuals with the LQTS type 2 phenotype. Beta blocker treatment was associated with a reduction of events in this nine-month time period after delivery [Seth et al 2007].
Early diagnosis of at-risk sibs by clinical examination and/or molecular genetic testing is important in order to monitor motor development and cardiac function so that treatment can be instituted early.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

If a fetus is diagnosed prenatally to have Salih myopathy, special considerations are needed at and following delivery since muscle weakness may manifest during the neonatal period.
It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual by molecular genetic testing of the SAMD9L pathogenic variant in the family in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from hematologic surveillance and prompt initiation of treatment for severe cytopenias and myelodysplasia.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Affected women may be on medications (e.g., antiepileptics) to control the symptoms of SCA17. Because some medications can have adverse effects on the developing fetus, a thorough discussion of the medical benefits vs. risks to the fetus of such medications before pregnancy (or, in the case of an unplanned pregnancy, immediately after pregnancy is determined) is appropriate.

Successful pregnancies have occurred in women with SHORT syndrome. If present, diabetes mellitus is managed as appropriate.

Fetal growth should be monitored recognizing that SHORT syndrome could be an explanation for IUGR in a pregnancy at 50% risk.
Early diagnosis of at-risk family members may allow intervention before symptoms are present.

If born in the United States, sibs affected with SCD are diagnosed by universal newborn screening soon after birth (at which time referral to a pediatric hematologist is appropriate). Many states also identify sickle cell trait on newborn screening.

If newborn screening data is not available for at-risk sibs, several diagnostic approaches can be considered.

If the HBB pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known, the gold standard is a combination of HPLC or isoelectric focusing combined with a CBC and reticulocyte count. As microcytosis helps guide interpretation of results, a measure of iron status such as a ZPP (zinc protoporphyrin) test or serum iron and TIBC (total iron binding capacity) is of benefit.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy complications in SCD can be minimized with close follow up and collaboration between hematology and obstetric teams [Naik & Lanzkron 2012]. Pregnancy in women with SCD involves increased risk for thrombosis, infectious complications, and acute painful episodes [Villers et al 2008, Naik & Lanzkron 2012, Alayed et al 2014, Costa et al 2015]. There is conflicting information as to whether the risks for preeclampsia, eclampsia, pre-term labor, and maternal death are increased [Villers et al 2008, Naik & Lanzkron 2012, Alayed et al 2014, Costa et al 2015]. The risk of pregnancy complications increases when access to prenatal care is limited, reinforcing the importance of close hematologic and obstetric follow up [Naik & Lanzkron 2012]. The benefits of a chronic transfusion program versus the use of “as-needed” transfusions has not been established [Okusanya and Oladapo 2016]. As hydroxyurea is recommended for (and increasingly used in) adults, the current recommendation is that it be discontinued during pregnancy. While reports of human infants exposed prenatally to hydroxyurea have not noted an increased risk of malformations, in experimental animal models hydroxyurea has been noted to lead to an increase in congenital anomalies. The role of chronic transfusions in lieu of hydroxyurea needs to be addressed.

More than 99% of births to women with SCD occurring after 28 weeks’ gestation are live births with normal Apgar scores [Smith et al 1996]. Several studies have reported increased rates of low birth weight and intrauterine growth retardation in babies born to women with SCD [Hassell 2005]. Attention to postnatal opiate withdrawal in the babies of mothers treated with high-dose opiates during pregnancy is warranted.

Infants with SCD are asymptomatic in the antenatal, perinatal, and immediate postnatal periods; they manifest disease symptoms when fetal hemoglobin production switches to adult hemoglobin.

Virtually all individuals with SCDO have relative truncal shortening, and some have generalized short stature. For affected women pregnancy may give rise to exaggerated intra-abdominal pressure problems, though there is no published research on this issue. As the spine is distorted there are likely to be concerns with offering spinal and/or epidural anesthesia. However, spinal anesthesia has been successfully administered [Dolak & Tartt 2009].
While no data on outcomes are available, it is appropriate to use molecular genetic testing for the SPR pathogenic variants identified in the proband and/or analysis of CSF neurotransmitter metabolites and pterins to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of an affected individual in order to identify as soon as possible those who would benefit from early initiation of treatment to correct CNS dopamine and serotonin deficiency.

Because of the variable expression of Stickler syndrome [Faber et al 2000], it is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband as well as other at-risk relatives in order to identify those who warrant ongoing evaluation (see Surveillance). Evaluation can be done in one of two ways:

By documenting medical history and performing physical examination and ophthalmologic, audiologic, and radiographic assessments. The examination of childhood photographs may be helpful in the assessment of craniofacial findings of adults, since the craniofacial findings characteristic of Stickler syndrome may become less distinctive with age.

By molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known

It is recommended that relatives at risk in whom the diagnosis of Stickler syndrome cannot be excluded with certainty be followed for potential complications.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Fewer than ten pregnancies have been reported in women with TAR syndrome. Almost all develop thrombocytopenia during pregnancy. In one, corticosteroids appeared to be fairly successful in treating the thrombocytopenia [Bot-Robin et al 2011].

When TD has been diagnosed prenatally, potential pregnancy complications include prematurity, polyhydramnios, malpresentation, and cephalopelvic disproportion caused by macrocephaly from hydrocephalus or a flexed and rigid neck. Cephalocentesis and cesarean section may be considered to avoid maternal complications.

Management of an affected pregnancy is directed by the level of parental desire for heroic life-saving measures and is often highly center-specific. It can be addressed on three levels:

Maternal. Surveillance for cephalopelvic disproportion, polyhydramnios, and/or preterm labor; avoidance of emergency C-section for fetal distress

Fetal. Surveillance for malpresentation, periodic prenatal ultrasound monitoring of head circumference, MRI for fetal lung volume, and/or fetal stress testing

Familial. Establishment of a perinatal plan for assessment, care, and/or withdrawal of care after delivery

Pregnancy Management

While there are no published studies evaluating pregnancy outcome in affected women, good diabetic control prior to and during pregnancy is recommended.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant in the family is known;

If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, physical examination and imaging studies (skin examination, retinal examination, brain imaging, and renal ultrasound examination) to assess for the clinical features of TSC (see Diagnosis).

It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known. Prenatal testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs before birth.

Blood or urine succinylacetone analysis as soon as possible after birth if prenatal testing was not performed. This allows prompt initiation of treatment, as postnatal genetic testing results may not be available in a timely fashion.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known, consideration of analysis for urine succinylacetone in healthy older sibs

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Little data exist on the use of nitisinone during human pregnancy. Speculation would assume that the pregnant woman remains safe from untoward events; however, the developing fetus may be at risk because of alterations in tyrosine metabolism.

At least two women have given birth to healthy infants while receiving therapeutic doses of nitisinone [Garcia Segarra et al 2010].

In one instance the affected mother gave birth to an unaffected infant who is reported to be healthy and developing normally at age 2.5 years [Garcia Segarra et al 2010, Vanclooster et al 2012].

In another instance, an affected woman gave birth to an affected child. The child is reported to have normal growth and development at age seven months [Garcia Segarra et al 2010]. The authors speculate that the affected child was protected from in utero liver damage by maternal treatment with nitisinone during pregnancy.

See www.mothertobaby.org for more information on medication exposure during pregnancy.

It is appropriate to examine sibs of an affected individual as soon as possible after birth to determine if facial and/or urinary tract manifestations of UFS are present to allow prompt evaluation of the urinary tract and renal function and prompt initiation of necessary treatment.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Although no guidelines for prenatal management of UFS exist, it seems appropriate to perform ultrasound examination of pregnancies at risk to determine if urinary tract involvement of UFS is present, as it may influence the timing and/or location of delivery (e.g., in a tertiary medical center that could manage renal/urinary complications immediately after birth).
It is appropriate to evaluate the hearing of all sibs at risk for Usher syndrome type I as soon after birth as possible to allow early diagnosis and treatment of hearing impairment.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known.

Auditory brain stem response (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate all sibs at risk for Usher syndrome type II as soon after birth as possible to allow early support and management of the child and the family. Evaluations include:

Audiology. ABR, DPOAE

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to evaluation of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

High-dose vitamin A supplementation should not be used by affected pregnant women, as large doses of vitamin A (doses above the RDA for pregnant or lactating women) may be teratogenic to the developing fetus (see Other).
Early recognition of manifestations of VHL syndrome may allow for timely intervention and improved outcome; thus, clinical surveillance of asymptomatic at-risk individuals (including children) for early manifestations of VHL syndrome is appropriate. The American Society of Clinical Oncology identifies VHL syndrome as a Group 1 disorder – a hereditary disease for which genetic testing is considered part of the standard management for at-risk family members [Robson et al 2010] (full text).

If the VHL pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used for early identification of at-risk family members to improve diagnostic certainty and reduce the need for screening procedures in those at-risk family members who have not inherited the pathogenic variant [Priesemann et al 2006].

If the VHL pathogenic variant in the family is not known and/or at-risk individuals decline genetic testing for religious or financial reasons, continued screening for VHL lesions is warranted (see Surveillance).

The use of molecular genetic testing for determining the genetic status of presumably at-risk relatives when a family member with a clinical diagnosis of VHL syndrome is not available for testing is not straightforward. Such test results need to be interpreted with caution. A positive test result signals the presence of a VHL pathogenic variant in the at-risk family member and indicates that the same molecular genetic testing method can be used to assess the genetic status of other at-risk family members. However, a negative test for a VHL pathogenic variant under such circumstances suggests one of the following possibilities:

The at-risk family member has not inherited a VHL pathogenic variant.

The familial VHL pathogenic variant may not be detectable by the assays used.

The clinical diagnosis of VHL syndrome in the affected family member is questionable.

In this situation, the presumably at-risk family member has a small, but finite, residual risk of having inherited a pathogenic allele (i.e., VHL syndrome or other hereditary disorder). In counseling such individuals, careful consideration should be given to the strength of the clinical diagnosis of VHL syndrome in the affected family member, the relationship of the at-risk individual to the affected family member, the perceived risk of an undetected VHL (or other gene) pathogenic variant, and the potential need for some form of continued clinical surveillance.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Recommended medical surveillance for pregnant women with VHL is still debated. Research by the French VHL Study Group showed a significantly higher complication rate of hemangioblastomas in individuals with VHL who had had at least one pregnancy [Abadie et al 2010]. Another study concluded that pregnancy has a significant influence on cerebellar hemangioblastoma growth and causes an overall high complication rate (17%) [Frantzen et al 2012]. Intensified surveillance could therefore be recommended in a specialized medical center during preconception care and pregnancy. Special attention should be paid to pheochromocytoma and cerebellar hemangioblastoma. In another study pregnancy was not related with the development of new hemangioblastomas or hemangioblastoma/cyst growth [Ye et al 2012]. Their data suggest no extra precautions need to be taken during gestation. The VHL Handbook recommends MRI of the cerebellum without contrast at four months’ gestation.
It is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from institution of treatment and preventive measures.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known, plasma or dried blood spot acylcarnitine analysis may not be sufficiently sensitive, and direct VLCAD assay of lymphocytes or FAO probe studies of cultured fibroblasts may be required.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

During pregnancy, placental and fetal β-oxidation may temporize or even improve maternal fatty acid β-oxidation [Mendez-Figueroa et al 2010]. However, labor and post-partum periods are catabolic states and place the mother at higher risk for rhabdomyolysis and subsequent myoglobinuria. A management plan for labor and delivery has been proposed by Mendez-Figueroa et al [2010].
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Evaluating at-risk neonates by physical examination is appropriate in order to identify those who may benefit from early treatment.

Lesions arising after infancy usually stay small and therefore are rarely symptomatic. If no lesions are seen at birth, a second evaluation should be done around puberty.

If the TEK pathogenic variant has been identified in the family, molecular genetic testing can be used to evaluate at-risk relatives.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management 

During pregnancy, affected women may develop small new lesions; in addition, existing lesions may increase in size and become painful. If the D-dimer level is high, low molecular-weight heparin therapy may be used to alleviate pain.
It is appropriate to evaluate sibs of a proband who are younger than age 12 months in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures. The majority of children with VODI present before age six months; however, as one child presented at age 11 months, testing should be considered in sibs of a proband who are younger than age 12 months.

Evaluations include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known;

Serum immunoglobulins, full blood count and liver function tests at birth and repeated at six months if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

Penetrance is complete (i.e., 100%) in the individuals with VODI described to date; thus, molecular genetic testing of healthy at-risk sibs of a proband who are older than age 12 months is not recommended.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

For an affected pregnant woman, ongoing intravenous immunoglobulin to prevent infection related to severe hypogammaglobulinemia and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis to prevent Pneumocystis jirovecii infection is appropriate during pregnancy. There is evidence that early treatment of a baby known to be homozygous for pathogenic SP110 pathogenic variants may result in improved long-term outcomes.
Once the familial pathogenic variant(s) have been identified, at-risk relatives can be readily analyzed for the pathogenic variant(s) to allow early diagnosis and treatment as needed [Keeney et al 2008].

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

VWF levels increase throughout pregnancy with the peak occurring in the third trimester. Nonetheless, pregnant women with VWD are at increased risk for bleeding complications and care should be provided in centers with experience in perinatal management of bleeding disorders [James & Jamison 2007, Varughese & Cohen 2007, James et al 2009].

Women with baseline VWF and FVIII levels of >30 IU/dL are likely to achieve normal levels by the time of delivery, whereas those with a basal level <20 IU/dL and those with baseline VWF:RCo/VWF:Ag ratio <0.6 are likely to require replacement therapy [Castaman et al 2013].

Although deliveries should occur based on obstetric indications, instrumentation should be minimized [Demers et al 2005].

Delayed, secondary postpartum bleeding may be a problem. VWF level rapidly returns to pre-pregnancy level following delivery [Castaman et al 2013].
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Reports addressing pregnancy management in women with VPS35-PD are not available. The effect of PD in general on pregnancy has not been well characterized, since pregnancy is uncommon in women with PD. While most reports indicate that disease manifestations worsen during pregnancy, improvement has also been described (for a review see Robottom et al [2008], Kranick et al [2010]).

No long-term outcome data exist for children born to mothers with Parkinson disease.

Levodopa crosses the placenta and some animal models have shown that high doses of levodopa administered during pregnancy may induce skeletal and visceral malformations; however, in more than 30 cases reported in the literature, levodopa treatment during human pregnancy did not result in adverse fetal outcome [Scott & Chowdhury 2005].

Amantadine should be avoided during pregnancy, if possible, since adverse pregnancy outcomes have been reported in rats.

Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given medication during pregnancy should ideally take place prior to conception. See MotherToBaby to access further information on medication use during pregnancy.
Offspring and/or sibs of an affected individual should be clinically examined for evidence of cleft palate including submucous cleft, lip abnormalities (pits or mounds), and the pyramidal skin-fold on the nail of the hallux, given the variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance of VWS and PPS.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to reduce morbidity by early diagnosis and treatment of ophthalmologic complications.

Evaluations can include:

Ophthalmologic exam if the pathogenic variant in the family is not known

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Evaluation of newborn at-risk males is recommended before any elective procedure such as circumcision.

It is appropriate to test at-risk males so that morbidity and mortality can be reduced by early diagnosis and treatment.

Rapid screening of at-risk males may be accomplished by WASP staining using flow cytometry.

Definitive testing is possible by molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant in the family is known.

There is no evidence that C-section reduces the risk of morbidity and mortality in males with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

In general, pregnancies in which the mother and/or fetus has a heterozygous EZH2 pathogenic variant are uncomplicated. Families and their health care providers should be aware that an affected baby may be large so that appropriate delivery plans can be made; in addition, information about the EZH2-related overgrowth phenotype should be provided.
See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of a proband/at-risk relatives in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

Evaluations can include:

Clinical examination including growth assessment, skin examination, and ophthalmology evaluation including slit lamp examination if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

In one study of individuals with Werner syndrome, signs of hypogonadism were reported in 80%; however, approximately half of those had children and showed signs of hypogonadism after age 30 years [Goto 1997]. Reports in the medical literature of pregnancy in individuals with Werner syndrome are rare, many of the women in the International Registry of Werner Syndrome have had offspring. Preterm delivery has been reported in several cases, and has been attributed to cervical incompetence. Preeclampsia is another reported obstetric complication [Murakami et al 2003].

The use of assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization and egg donation has not been reported in women with Werner syndrome.
Wolfram syndrome. Sibs of a proband warrant either molecular genetic testing (if the family-specific pathogenic variants are known) or screening for the earliest manifestations of WFS (i.e., diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss) to allow for early diagnosis and treatment.

Low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss (LFSNHL). At-risk relatives should be encouraged to seek either molecular genetic testing (if the family-specific pathogenic variant is known) or audiologic evaluation because the earliest manifestations of low-tone hearing loss may not be appreciated clinically.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnant women with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus have a two- to eightfold higher risk than pregnant women without diabetes of having a child with a birth defect or a pattern of birth defects (diabetic embryopathy). These defects can involve the craniofacial, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urogenital, musculoskeletal, and central nervous systems. Optimizing glucose control before and during pregnancy can reduce, but does not eliminate, the risk for diabetic embryopathy. High-resolution fetal ultrasonography and fetal echocardiogram are recommended to screen for congenital anomalies during pregnancy. Consultation with a maternal fetal medicine specialist during pregnancy should also be considered.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancies in women with WS are high risk. They should be monitored for the development of pregnancy-induced hypertension, arrhythmias, and heart failure. Regular urinalyses should be performed in late gestation due to the increased risk for urinary tract infection. Ultrasound monitoring of the fetus is suggested [Lin et al 2008].
The goal is to identify those sibs of a proband who have Wilson disease preferably before symptoms occur so that the therapies described under Treatment of Manifestations can be initiated as soon as possible. Evaluations can include the following:

Molecular genetic testing if both ATP7B pathogenic variants in the proband are known

If the pathogenic variants in an affected family member are not known, biochemical assessment of parameters of copper metabolism (serum copper, urinary copper, ceruloplasmin) and liver function tests as well as ultrasound imaging of the liver and slit lamp examination for the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings

Note: Because presymptomatic individuals generally have a low serum concentration of ceruloplasmin and mildly increased basal 24-hour urinary copper excretion, biochemical testing can be used; however, sometimes asymptomatic affected individuals cannot be distinguished from heterozygotes.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Treatment must be continued during pregnancy because of the risk of fulminant hepatic failure.

D-penicillamine has been used in many pregnancies with no adverse outcomes; however, congenital connective tissue disorders encompassing inguinal hernias and skin laxity have been reported in some exposed infants. Such adverse outcomes may depend on dose, which should be kept as low as possible. The dose of D-penicillamine should be maintained at the lowest effective dose with the plan to reduce by approximately 30% in the third trimester if the mother has been well chelated prior to pregnancy. A possible over-chelated (copper deficiency) status prior to pregnancy or genetic characteristics of the mother can contribute to fetal abnormalities [Pinter et al 2004].

Trientine has been used successfully during pregnancy, but the total number of reported cases is small. Reduction of the dose to the lowest effective dose is recommended using a comparable approach to that for D-penicillamine.

Zinc has been used effectively during pregnancy.

See www.mothertobaby.org for more information on medication use during pregnancy.
It is appropriate to evaluate at-risk relatives of an affected individual to allow early screening of those at risk for hearing loss. Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant in the family is known;

Physical examination for the clinical features of WS1 and audiology evaluation if the pathogenic variant in the family is not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Folic acid supplementation in pregnancy has been recommended for women at increased risk of having a child with WS1, given the possibly increased risk of neural tube defects in association with WS1 [Fleming & Copp 1998]; however, no human studies have addressed the ideal dose of folic acid to be used during pregnancy.
Molecular genetic testing for known familial DCAF17 pathogenic variants is appropriate for the evaluation of apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who will benefit from early identification and treatment of potential complications.

It is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from timely treatment of adrenal insufficiency [Mahmood et al 2005].

If the ABCD1 pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

If the ABCD1 pathogenic variant in the family is not known, very long chain fatty acid analysis may be used with the limitations previously discussed to clarify the disease status of at-risk relatives.

It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic, at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early diagnosis and treatment and, importantly, measures to avoid hyperthermia.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known;

Targeted history, physical examination, and dental examination for the features of HED if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are not known. A sweat test can be done in at-risk relatives of an individual with XLHED.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Optimal prenatal nutrition is recommended for mothers who are carriers of or affected with HED. Affected women at risk for hyperthermia should take extra care not to become overheated during pregnancy. There are no other special recommendations for pregnancy management.

Some women may have difficulty breastfeeding their infants because of hypoplasia of the mammary glands.
Once the pathogenic variant has been identified in a proband, molecular genetic testing of at-risk sibs and other maternal male relatives is appropriate for medical management and for consideration of presymptomatic bone marrow transplantation.

Given the risk for vascular disease in neurologically asymptomatic individuals, it is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, head MRI can be used to clarify the disease status of at-risk relatives.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Ideally, women should seek information prior to conception regarding risks to the fetus associated with taking an anti-seizure medication during pregnancy so that changes in the anti-seizure medication regimen (if needed) can be made prior to conception. If not done prior to conception, discussion of the risks and benefits of anti-seizure medication use during pregnancy should occur as soon as the pregnancy is recognized. The teratogenic risk to the fetus associated with the use of anti-seizure medication during pregnancy depends on the type of anti-seizure medication used, the dose, and the gestational age of the fetus.

Currently no guidelines exist on the most appropriate surveillance for and management of cardiac, vascular, and connective tissue problems during pregnancy in women with PVNH. See Marfan Syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Classic Type for possible pregnancy management recommendations.
It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic at-risk male relatives of an affected individual by molecular genetic testing of the IL2RG pathogenic variant in the family in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

When the pathogenic variant in the family is known, prenatal diagnosis of at-risk males allows preparation for bone marrow transplantation to be initiated before birth. Most couples at risk of having an affected male have desired prenatal testing to help prepare for optimal treatment of an affected newborn: bone marrow transplantation centers were chosen, HLA testing of family members and the prenatal sample was carried out, and a search for a marrow donor could be initiated [Puck et al 1997a].

It is appropriate to evaluate at-risk male relatives as soon after birth as possible so that gammaglobulin substitution therapy can be initiated promptly and administration of live viral vaccines can be avoided. Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing for the known family-specific BTK pathogenic variant;

Analysis of the percentage of B cells in the peripheral circulation.

Note: Serum immunoglobulins will not be helpful in the evaluation of a newborn or infant because maternal IgG crosses the placenta.

Pregnancy Management

The systemic retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin are used as skin cancer chemopreventive agents in individuals who are actively developing large numbers of skin cancers, and thus may be used by some women with XP [Kraemer et al 1988]. Systemic retinoids are known to be teratogenic to a developing fetus and pose a high risk for birth defects. Therefore, women who are using systemic retinoids should be appropriately counseled about pregnancy risks and the need for effective contraception; regular monitoring with pregnancy tests is indicated. Systemic retinoids should be administered only by physicians who are knowledgeable regarding their risks and benefits.

To access isotretinoin in the US, women and their prescribing providers must be enrolled in the iPLEDGE program to minimize the potential for fetal exposure. Pregnancy avoidance is initiated before therapy, continues during therapy, and extends post-treatment until the drug is cleared from the body. While both drugs may be effective in preventing skin cancers, acitretin may take longer to be eliminated from the body, requiring an extended period (3 years) of post-therapy pregnancy avoidance to minimize teratogenic risk.
It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic children who are relatives of an affected individual by genomic testing for the int22h1/int22h2-mediated Xq28 duplication. Clinically asymptomatic children who have the familial duplication should be assessed and monitored for developmental delay with the goal of early initiation of therapies and support if needed.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
Because the outcome of HSCT in children with ZAP70-related CID is significantly improved by performing HSCT prior to the onset of severe infections, early testing of at-risk sibs should be considered. In addition, any sibs considered as bone marrow donors must be evaluated for ZAP70-related CID prior to donation.

If the ZAP70 pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known, CBC, quantitative immunoglobulins, and lymphocyte subsets and proliferation can be used to clarify the genetic status (immunologic status) of at-risk sibs.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Appropriately screened blood products should be available, if needed, during the course of the pregnancy and delivery.
