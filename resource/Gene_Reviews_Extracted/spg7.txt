Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with spastic paraplegia 7 (SPG7), evaluation by a multidisciplinary team that includes a general practitioner, neurologist, clinical geneticist, physical therapist, social worker, and psychologist should be considered.

Treatment of Manifestations

 No specific drug treatments or cures exist for SPG7. Drugs to reduce spasticity and muscle tightness include baclofen, tizanidine, dantrolene, and diazepam â€” preferably administered one at a time. Management of spasticity by intrathecal baclofen or intramuscular botulinum toxin injections may be an option in selected individuals [Young 1994]. A combination of physical therapy and assistive walking devices are often used to reduce contractures, provide support, and promote stability. Occupational therapy is often helpful in managing activities of daily living.

Surveillance

 Annual neurologic evaluation can help identify potential complications of spasticity that develop over time (e.g., contractures).

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Therapies Under Investigation

 In an SPG7 mouse model using intramuscular viral delivery of the gene to correct some of the defects, Pirozzi et al [2006] observed an improvement of neuropathologic changes and mitochondrial morphology, described by Ferreirinha et al [2004], in the peripheral nerves of paraplegin-deficient mice. This approach may offer hope for future treatment strategies. Search ClinicalTrials.gov for access to information on clinical studies for a wide range of diseases and conditions.
