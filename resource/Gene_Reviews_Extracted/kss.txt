Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with a mitochondrial DNA deletion syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended: Complete neurologic, cardiologic, ophthalmologic, and endocrinologic evaluations for KSS and PEO in children and adults Complete hematologic and gastroenterologic evaluations for Pearson syndrome in infants Complete neurologic, cardiac, gastrointestinal, endocrinologic, and renal evaluations for Leigh syndrome.

Treatment of Manifestations

The following are appropriate: Placement of cardiac pacemaker in individuals with cardiac conduction block to reduce the risk of sudden death Placement of eyelid slings for severe ptosis Cochlear implants and hearing aids for neurosensory hearing loss Hormone replacement for endocrinopathies Dilation of the upper esophageal sphincter to alleviate cricopharyngeal achalasia Folinic acid supplementation in individuals with KSS with low CSF folic acid Replacement of pancreatic enzymes in Pearson syndrome Administration of coenzyme Q10 (50-200 mg 3x/day) and L-carnitine (330 mg 3x/day) Physical and occupational therapy Treatment of depression Ventilatory support for respiratory abnormalities in Leigh syndrome.

Prevention of Secondary Complications

Antioxidants may ameliorate damage from reactive oxygen species (ROS). Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) may improve nutritional intake and prevent aspiration pneumonia in individuals with severe dysphagia.

Surveillance

Surveillance includes the following: ECG and echocardiogram every six to 12 months to monitor cardiac conduction and contractility Yearly audiometry and endocrinologic evaluation

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid

Medications to avoid: Drugs potentially toxic to mitochondria, including chloramphenicol, aminoglycosides, linezolide, valproic acid, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors Dichloroacetate (DCA) as a lactate-lowering agent, as DCA has been proven to cause peripheral neuropathy [Kaufmann et al 2006]

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

Symptomatic maternal relatives should be screened for the specific mtDNA deletion. See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
