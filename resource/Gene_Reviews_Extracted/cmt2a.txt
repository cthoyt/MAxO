Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Charcot-Marie-Tooth hereditary neuropathy type 2A (CMT2A), the following evaluations are recommended: Neurologic examination EMG with NCV Visual evoked potentials Medical genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations

The affected individual is often managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes a neurologist, physiatrist, orthopedic surgeon, and physical and occupational therapists [Carter et al 1995]. Treatment is symptomatic and may include the following: Daily heel cord stretching exercises to prevent Achilles tendon shortening Special shoes, including those with good ankle support Ankle/foot orthoses to correct foot drop and aid walking [Carter et al 1995] Orthopedic surgery to correct severe pes cavus deformity [Holmes & Hansen 1993, Guyton & Mann 2000] Forearm crutches or canes for gait stability Wheelchairs for mobility because of gait instability Exercise within the individual's capability Treatment of musculoskeletal pain with acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents [Carter et al 1998] Treatment of neuropathic pain with tricyclic antidepressants or drugs such as carbamazepine or gabapentin Career and employment counseling because of persistent weakness of hands and/or feet

Surveillance

Annual neurologic evaluation of gait, strength, and visual acuity is appropriate.

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid

Obesity is to be avoided because it makes walking more difficult. Medications that are toxic or potentially toxic to persons with CMT comprise a spectrum of risk ranging from definite high risk to negligible risk. Click here (pdf) for an up-to-date list.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Therapies Under Investigation

Dyck et al [1982], Donaghy et al [2000], and Ginsberg et al [2004] have described a few individuals with CMT1 and sudden deterioration in whom treatment with steroids (prednisone) or intravenous immunoglobulin has produced variable levels of improvement. No similar report on CMT2A exists. Search ClinicalTrials.gov for access to information on clinical studies for a wide range of diseases and conditions.
