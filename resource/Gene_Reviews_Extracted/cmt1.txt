Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 1 (CMT1), the following evaluations are recommended: Physical examination to determine extent of weakness and atrophy, pes cavus, gait stability, and sensory loss NCV to help distinguish demyelinating, axonal, and mixed forms of neuropathy Detailed family history Clinical genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations

 Individuals with CMT1 are often evaluated and managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes neurologists, physiatrists, orthopedic surgeons, and physical and occupational therapists [Carter 1997, Grandis & Shy 2005]. Treatment is symptomatic and may include the following: Special shoes, including those with good ankle support; affected individuals often require ankle/foot orthoses (AFOs) to correct foot drop and aid walking [Ramdharry et al 2012a]. Orthopedic surgery to correct severe pes cavus deformity [Guyton & Mann 2000, Ward et al 2008, Boffeli & Tabatt 2015] Forearm crutches or canes for gait stability for some individuals; fewer than 5% of individuals need wheelchairs. Exercise within the individual's capability; many remain physically active. Exercise is not detrimental to persons with CMT [Piscosquito et al 2014]. Serial night casting to help increase ankle flexibility [Rose et al 2010] Accurate identification, as far as possible, of the cause of pain: Musculoskeletal pain may respond to acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents [Carter et al 1998]. Neuropathic pain may respond to tricyclic antidepressants or drugs such as carbamazepine or gabapentin. Career and employment counseling to address persistent weakness of hands and/or feet Interventions designed to improve leg cramps, tremor, agility, endurance, and ankle flexibility, thereby improving quality of life; see Burns et al [2010] study of children with CMT1A.

Prevention of Primary Manifestations

 No treatment reverses or slows the natural progression of CMT.

Prevention of Secondary Complications

 Daily heel cord stretching exercises to prevent Achilles' tendon shortening are desirable.

Surveillance

 Individuals should be evaluated regularly by a team comprising physiatrists, neurologists, and physical and occupational therapists to determine neurologic status and functional disability.

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid

 Obesity is to be avoided because it makes walking more difficult. Medications that are toxic or potentially toxic to persons with CMT comprise a spectrum of risk ranging from definite high risk to negligible risk. Click here (pdf) for an up-to-date list.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

 Rudnik-Schöneborn et al [1993] evaluated 45 pregnancies in 21 women with CMT1. Worsening of the CMT1 symptoms during or after gestation was reported in about half of pregnancies. A follow-up study of 63 pregnancies in 33 women with CMT showed no serious complications but 20% of women reported a worsening of symptoms during pregnancy [Awater et al 2012]. In a study of affected pregnant women in Norway, deliveries involved a higher occurrence of presentation anomalies, use of forceps, and operative delivery; the women also experienced increased post-partum bleeding [Hoff et al 2005].

Therapies Under Investigation

 Reilly & Shy [2009], Roberts [2012], and Patel & Pleasure [2013] have reviewed research on potential new treatments of CMT. Dyck et al [1982], Ginsberg et al [2004], and Carvalho et al [2005] have described a few individuals with CMT1 and sudden deterioration in whom treatment with steroids (prednisone) or IVIg has produced variable levels of improvement. Nerve biopsy has shown lymphocytic infiltration. One such family had a specific MPZ pathogenic variant (p.Ile99Thr) [Donaghy et al 2000]. Sahenk et al [2005] studied the effects of neurotrophin-3 (NT3) on individuals with CMT1A. This same group has shown benefit of NT3 delivered by adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy in a mouse model of CMT1A [Sahenk et al 2014]. Passage et al [2004] reported benefit from ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in a mouse model of CMT1. Similar benefit was reported with a progesterone receptor antagonist in a rat model of CMT [Meyer zu Horste et al 2007]. Two high-dose (1,000-1,500 mg/day) treatment trials of ascorbic acid in CMT1A have found no beneficial effect over a period of one to two years [Verhamme et al 2009b, Pareyson et al 2011]. Lewis et al [2013] also could not find a positive treatment response to ascorbic acid vs. placebo in 110 subjects with CMT1A. Patzkó et al [2012] provided evidence for the potential use of curcumin in the treatment of individuals with CMT1B who have pathogenic variants in MPZ. Fledrich et al [2014] suggested neuregulin-1 as a potential treatment for CMT1A based on experiments in a rat model of the disease.
