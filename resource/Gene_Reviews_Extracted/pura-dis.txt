Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with a PURA-related neurodevelopmental disorder, the following evaluations are recommended. Recommended Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

Treatment of Manifestations

 Individuals often benefit when management is provided by a multidisciplinary team including relevant specialists, which may include, but is not limited to, a pediatrician, clinical geneticist, child neurologist, pulmonologist, ophthalmologist, orthopedic surgeon, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, and speech and language therapist. Treatment of Manifestations in Individuals with PURA-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorders GERD = gastroesophageal reflux disease The following information represents typical management recommendations for individuals with developmental delay/intellectual disability in the United States; standard recommendations may vary from country to country.

Global Developmental Disability/ Intellectual Disability Educational Issues

 For ages 0-3 years. Referral to an early intervention program is recommended for access to occupational, physical, speech, and feeding therapy. In the United States, early intervention is a nationwide, federally funded program available in all states. For ages 3-5 years. In the United States, developmental preschool through the local public school district is recommended. An evaluation will occur before placement to determine needed services and therapies and will be subsequently written into an individualized education plan (IEP). 
              For ages 5-21 years
             In the United States, an IEP should be developed by the local public school district based on each individual’s level of function. Affected children are permitted to remain in the public school district until age 21. Discussion about transition plans including financial, vocation/employment, and medical arrangements should begin at age 12 years. Developmental pediatricians can provide assistance with transition to adulthood. For all ages. Consultation with a developmental pediatrician is recommended to ensure that appropriate community, state, and educational agencies are involved and to support parents in maximizing quality of life. Some issues to consider: Private supportive therapies based on the affected individual’s needs. Specific recommendations regarding type of therapy can be made by a developmental pediatrician. In the United States, enrollment in DDA (Developmental Disabilities Administration) is recommended. DDA is a public agency that provides services and supports to qualified individuals. Eligibility differs by state but is typically determined by diagnosis and/or associated cognitive/adaptive disabilities. In the United States, families with limited income and resources may also qualify for supplemental security income for their child with a disability.

Motor Dysfunction

 
              Gross motor dysfunction
             Physical therapy is recommended to maximize mobility and to reduce the risk for later-onset orthopedic complications (e.g., scoliosis, hip dislocation). Consider use of durable medical equipment as needed (e.g., wheelchairs, walkers, bath chairs, orthotics, adaptive strollers). For muscle tone abnormalities including dystonia, consider involving appropriate specialists to aid in management of medications or orthopedic procedures. Fine motor dysfunction. Occupational therapy is recommended for difficulty with fine motor skills that affect adaptive function (e.g., feeding, grooming, dressing). Oral motor dysfunction. Assuming that the individual is safe to eat by mouth, feeding therapy (typically from an occupational or speech therapist) is recommended for affected individuals who have difficulty feeding due to poor oral motor control. Communication issues. Consider alternative means of communication for individuals who have expressive language difficulties, such as an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) evaluation.
