Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with familial paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD), the following evaluations are recommended: MRI to rule out secondary causes of PKD EEG to rule out seizures as a cause of the dyskinesias Clinical genetics consultation and testing for pathogenic variants in PRRT2

Treatment of Manifestations

Attack frequency is reduced or prevented by the anticonvulsants phenytoin or carbamezepine, typically at lower doses than are used to treat epilepsy [Demirkiran & Jankovic 1995, McGrath & Dure 2003]. Other anticonvulsants proven to be effective include oxcarbazepine [Tsao 2004], ethosuximide [Guerrini et al 2002], lamotrigine [Pereira et al 2000], and gabapentin [Chudnow et al 1997].

Surveillance

Individuals with PKD can be monitored every one to two years, particularly with respect to medication needs and doses.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnant women who are on anticonvulsants therapy for PKD are recommended to take folic acid 5 mg/day. Because of the risk of teratogenic effects related to anticonvulsants, women with mild symptoms related to PKD may wish to consider discontinuing anticonvulsant therapy during pregnancy.
