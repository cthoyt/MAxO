Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

To establish the extent of involvement and needs in an individual diagnosed with nonsyndromic hearing loss and deafness caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in GJB2 (DFNB1), the following evaluations are recommended: Complete assessment of auditory acuity using age-appropriate tests such as ABR testing, auditory steady-state response (ASSR) testing, and pure tone audiometry Ophthalmologic evaluation for refractive errors Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Treatment of Manifestations

The following are indicated: Fitting with appropriate hearing aids Enrollment in an appropriate educational program for the hearing impaired Consideration of cochlear implantation (CI), an excellent habilitation option for persons with profound deafness Recognition that, unlike with many clinical conditions, the management and treatment of severe-to-profound congenital deafness falls largely within the purview of the social welfare and educational systems rather than the medical care system [Smith et al 2005] Also see Hereditary Hearing Loss and Deafness for more detailed discussion of management issues.

Surveillance

The following are appropriate: Annual examination by a physician familiar with hereditary hearing impairment Repeat audiometry to confirm stability of hearing loss

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid

Individuals with hearing loss should avoid environmental exposures known to cause hearing loss. Most important among these for persons with DFNB1 and mild-to-moderate hearing loss is avoidance of repeated overexposure to loud noises.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

If both GJB2 pathogenic variants have been identified in the proband, it is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs shortly after birth so that appropriate early support and management can be provided to the child and family. See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
