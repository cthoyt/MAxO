Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of involvement and needs in an individual diagnosed with nonsyndromic hearing loss, DFNA3, the following evaluations are recommended: Complete assessment of auditory acuity using age-appropriate tests including ABR testing, auditory steady-state response (ASSR) testing, and/or pure tone audiometry (see Deafness and Hereditary Hearing Loss Overview). Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Treatment of Manifestations

 Early diagnosis, habilitation with hearing aids or cochlear implantation, and educational programming will diminish the likelihood of long-term speech or educational delay. The following are indicated: Fitting with appropriate hearing aids Enrollment in an appropriate educational program for the hearing impaired Consideration of cochlear implantation, an effective habilitation option for persons with preserved residual hearing [Gantz et al 2016] Recognition that unlike with many clinical conditions, management and treatment of mild-to-profound deafness fall largely within the purview of the social welfare and educational systems rather than the medical care system [Smith et al 2005] See Hereditary Hearing Loss and Deafness for more detailed discussion of management issues.

Surveillance

 The following are appropriate: Semiannual examination by a physician who is familiar with hereditary hearing impairment Repeat audiometry to confirm stability of hearing loss

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid

 Individuals with hearing loss should avoid environmental exposures known to cause hearing loss. Most important is avoidance of repeated exposure to loud noises.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 If a GJB2 or GJB6 pathogenic variant has been identified in the proband, it is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs shortly after birth so that appropriate early support and management can be provided to the child and family. See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Therapies Under Investigation
