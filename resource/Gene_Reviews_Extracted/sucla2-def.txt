Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with SUCLA2-related mtDNA depletion syndrome, the following evaluations need to be performed (if not already done as part of the initial diagnostic evaluation): Comprehensive neurologic examination and developmental/cognitive assessment. The following diagnostic modalities can be used to assess the degree of neurologic involvement: Neuroimaging (preferably brain MRI) to establish the degree of central nervous system involvement EMG to assess myopathy EEG if seizures are suspected Audiology evaluation Ophthalmologic examination Nutritional evaluation and swallowing assessment for feeding difficulties and growth failure Physical examination for the back and joints for kyphoscoliosis and joint contractures Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Treatment of Manifestations

 Management should involve a multidisciplinary team including specialists in neurology, audiology, child development, gastroenterology, nutrition, and clinical genetics. Treatments include the following: Physical therapy to help maintain muscle function and prevent joint contractures Standard treatment with antiepileptic drugs for seizures Nutritional support by a dietitian and the use of a nasogastric tube or gastrostomy tube feedings to address feeding difficulties and failure to thrive Chest physiotherapy, aggressive antibiotic treatment of chest infections, and artificial ventilation (including assisted nasal ventilation or intubation and the use of a tracheostomy and ventilator) for respiratory insufficiency Bracing for scoliosis and kyphosis Blepharoplasty for significant ptosis Hearing aids and/or cochlear implantation for sensorineural hearing loss

Surveillance

 No clinical guidelines for surveillance are available. The following evaluations are suggested, with frequency varying according to the severity of the condition: Routine developmental and neurologic assessment Periodic nutritional and growth assessment Periodic hearing evaluation Periodic ophthalmologic examination Routine physical examination of back and joints for kyphoscoliosis and joint contractures

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
