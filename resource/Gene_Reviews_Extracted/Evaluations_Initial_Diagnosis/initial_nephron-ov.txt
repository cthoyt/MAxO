To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with nephronophthisis, the following evaluations are recommended [Parisi et al 2007, Simms et al 2011, KDIGO 2013]:

Detailed family history and physical examination including blood pressure, growth parameters, developmental assessment, and dysmorphology examination to evaluate for extrarenal manifestations (Table 3a)

Tests to evaluate the kidneys:

Tests of renal function including serum creatinine concentration, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urea or blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and electrolytes

Complete blood count (CBC) to evaluate for anemia

Tests to evaluate for the metabolic bone disease of chronic kidney disease (CKD) including serum calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and alkaline phosphatase activity

Urinalysis from first-morning void for specific gravity to test concentrating ability (if feasible), proteinuria

Tests of liver function including serum concentrations of transaminases, albumin, bilirubin, and prothrombin time

Abdominal ultrasound examination to evaluate renal findings consistent with nephronophthisis and to evaluate for additional anomalies in liver, bile duct, spleen, and/ or pancreas (including situs inversus)

Referral as needed for evaluation of extrarenal manifestations, including:

Ophthalmologic examination

Brain MRI

Skeletal radiographs

Assessment of psychomotor development and/or behavior

Neurologic assessment

Endocrine assessment

Cardiac ultrasound examination

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
