To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with a SALL4-related disorder, the following evaluations are recommended:

Eyes. A complete eye examination by an ophthalmologist with special attention to extraocular movements and structural eye defects

Heart. Baseline evaluation by a cardiologist including an echocardiogram and an ECG. If suspected, more extensive evaluation for cardiac conduction defects may be needed especially when structural heart defects are present.

Kidneys. Renal ultrasound examination and routine laboratory tests for renal function

Hearing. See Hereditary Hearing Loss and Deafness Overview.

Endocrine. If growth retardation is present, consideration of evaluation for growth hormone deficiency

Blood. Baseline CBC to evaluate for thrombocytopenia and/or leukocytosis.

Clinical genetics consultation
