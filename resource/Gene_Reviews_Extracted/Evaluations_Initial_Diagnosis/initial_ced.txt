To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED), the initial evaluation should include the following:

Complete skeletal survey (if not performed as part of the diagnostic work up)

Assessment for cranial nerve deficits, including neurologic examination, hearing screen, and ophthalmologic evaluation

Baseline blood pressure if considering treatment with losartan

CBC to evaluate for anemia in individuals with significant endosteal involvement

If acute bone pain is present, consideration of ESR and bone scan as baseline measures of disease activity

In individuals with radiographic evidence of skull base sclerosis and neurologic symptoms, consideration of baseline CT of the head and neck to determine the extent of disease and allow consideration of surgical treatment options

Medical genetics consultation
