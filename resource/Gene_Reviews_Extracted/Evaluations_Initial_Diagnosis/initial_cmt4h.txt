To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 4H (CMT4H), the following evaluations are recommended:

Physical examination to determine extent of weakness and atrophy, pes cavus, gait stability, sensory loss, and skeletal deformities. In children with CMT, one should use the CMTPedS score defined by Burns et al [2012], a reliable, well-tolerated, valid, and sensitive global measure of disability for children with CMT from the age of 3 years [Burns et al 2012].

Although the CMT Neuropathy Score (CMTNS) and CMTNS version 2 (CMTNS2) are widely used in the diagnosis of CMT [Shy et al 2005, Murphy et al 2011], they have shown limited potential in measuring disability and disease severity in children younger than age ten years [Haberlov√° & Seeman 2010, Pagliano et al 2011].

The transition from the CMTPedS in childhood to the CMTNS2 in adulthood has been evaluated [Burns et al 2013]; together, the two measures provide a continuum for lifelong measurement of disability in patients with CMT.

Orthopedic consultation to evaluate skeletal deformities such as foot deformities (pes cavus) and scoliosis and to determine the need for a surgery and/or ankle/foot orthoses

Clinical genetics consultation and/or pediatric neurology consultation
