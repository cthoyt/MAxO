To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with DNMT1-related dementia, deafness, and sensory neuropathy (HSAN IE), the following evaluations are recommended:

Neurologic examination to determine the extent of sensory involvement, including sensory testing and observation for skin ulceration

Past medical history to determine extent of autonomic involvement

Evaluation of central nervous system involvement, using tests of cognitive function and brain imaging

Audiologic examination to determine if hearing loss is present and, if present, its type and severity

Medical genetics consultation
