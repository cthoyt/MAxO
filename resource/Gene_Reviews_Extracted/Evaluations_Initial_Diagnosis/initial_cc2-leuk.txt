Brain MRI if not performed at the time of diagnostic work up

Physical therapy/occupational therapy assessment, if significant neurologic problems are present

Ophthalmologic examination with attention to visual acuity and visual fields

Audiologic examination

For adult males: evaluation of testicular function

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
