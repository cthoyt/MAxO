To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML), the following evaluations are recommended:

Complete physical and neurologic examination

Plotting of growth parameters on Noonan syndrome growth charts by Witt et al [1986] (Specific growth charts for NSML are not available.)

Cardiac evaluation with echocardiography and electrocardiography

Ophthalmologic evaluation

Hearing evaluation including complete assessment of auditory acuity using age-appropriate tests (e.g., ABR testing, auditory steady-state response [ASSR] testing, pure tone audiometry)

Renal ultrasound examination; urinalysis if urinary tract abnormalities are identified

Clinical and radiographic assessment of spine and rib cage

Brain and cervical spine MRI if neurologic symptoms are present

Multidisciplinary developmental evaluation

Consultation with a medical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
