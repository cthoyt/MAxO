To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Usher syndrome type I, the following evaluations are recommended:

Audiology. Otoscopy, pure tone audiometry, assessment of speech perception, and, in some individuals, auditory brain stem response (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE)

Vestibular function. Rotary chair, calorics, electronystagmography, and computerized posturography

Ophthalmology. Funduscopy, visual acuity, visual field (Goldmann perimetry), and electroretinography (ERG)

Clinical genetics. Consultation with a clincial geneticist and/or genetic counselor
