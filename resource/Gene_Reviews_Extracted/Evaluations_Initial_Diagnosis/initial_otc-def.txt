To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, the following evaluations are recommended if they have not already been completed:

Plasma ammonia concentration

Plasma amino acid analysis

Laboratory values that reflect nutritional status (e.g., vitamin D level, ferritin, pre-albumin)

Liver function tests (liver enzymes, bilirubin, albumin)

PT/PTT and fibrinogen

Developmental/neuropsychological/psychological evaluation

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
