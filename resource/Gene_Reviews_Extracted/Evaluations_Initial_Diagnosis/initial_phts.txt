To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Complete medical history and family history

Physical examination with particular attention to skin, mucous membranes, thyroid, breasts

In children: consideration of neurodevelopmental evaluation

Urinalysis with cytospin

Baseline thyroid ultrasound examination* (on identification of a PTEN pathogenic variant)

For women age ≥30 years at diagnosis*:

Breast screening (at minimum mammogram; MRI may also be incorporated)

Transvaginal ultrasound or endometrial biopsy

For men and women age ≥35 years at diagnosis*: colonoscopy

For men and women age ≥40 years at diagnosis*: renal imaging (CT or MRI preferred)

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

* For individuals with a family history of a particular cancer type at an early age, screening may be considered five to ten years prior to the youngest diagnosis in the family.
