To establish the extent of neurologic and intellectual impairment in an individual diagnosed with familial dysautonomia, the following evaluations are recommended:

Standardized intelligence tests; frequently demonstrate better verbal than motor performance.

Electroencephalography; may identify epileptic activity, although seizures with decerebrate posturing can follow breath holding even in children with normal EEG findings.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); frequently shows generalized atrophy, including in the cerebellum, which may contribute worsening of the ataxic gait and greater balance problems.

Assessment of chronic respiratory disease including spirometry (possible from age 6 years onwards), arterial blood gases, polysomnography, and a swallow study

Clinical genetics consultation
