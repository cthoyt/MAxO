To establish the extent of disease and management needs for an individual with a FOXP2-related speech and language disorder, the following evaluations conducted by a trained and specialized speech-language pathologist are recommended:

Detailed developmental history including early oral motor and feeding abilities, speech sound development, motor milestones, and cognitive development

Family history of speech disorder

Oral-facial structural examination to determine if any structural abnormalities are present

Assessment of oral motor function including:

Examination of cranial nerve function for evidence of asymmetry, reduced or increased tone, and/or poor coordination of neuromuscular movements

Examination for evidence of oral motor dyspraxia (e.g., can the patient perform oral movements on command in isolation [e.g., ‘bite’ or ‘blow’] or in sequence [e.g., ‘kiss and blow’; ‘kiss, blow, and bite’])

Speech sound assessment including a test of single words, sounds in isolation, and connected speech to determine the child’s phonetic inventory (i.e., has the child acquired age-appropriate speech sounds) and to determine if the child has articulation errors, phonologic errors, apraxic errors, dysarthric errors, or a combination of these errors. The presence of resonance or nasality deficits signals the need to consider whether such structurally based velopharyngeal port incompetence is present by referral to an ear, nose, and throat specialist and possibly videopalatography.

Language assessment to determine the presence of receptive and/or expressive language impairments across the domains of semantics, syntax, and morphology

Literacy assessment or pre-literacy (phonologic awareness) for evidence of reading and spelling difficulties

Social skills assessment for the presence of autistic features

Additional evaluations:

Referral to a neuropsychologist or clinical psychologist to determine the extent of any coexisting cognitive and learning impairments and to examine for the presence of behaviors associated with autism spectrum disorder

Referral to a physiotherapist if gross motor movement difficulties are reported and an occupational therapist if fine motor movement difficulties are observed

Consideration of MRI to evaluate for the presence of a neurologic lesion if indicated

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
