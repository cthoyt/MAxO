To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended:

Measurement of growth parameters and plotting on growth charts

Evaluation of cognitive, language, and motor development and social skills

Waking/sleeping video-EEG-polygraphic studies in childhood (mainly ages 1-6 years) to detect atypical absence seizures that may be subtle [Battaglia & Carey 2000, Battaglia et al 2009]

Evaluation for feeding problems and gastroesophageal reflux with referral to a dysphagia team

Physical examination for skeletal anomalies (e.g., clubfoot, scoliosis, kyphosis); if anomalies are present, referral for orthopedic and physical therapy evaluation (including full biomechanical assessment)

Ophthalmology consultation in infancy even in the absence of overt anomalies

Examination of the heart (auscultation, electrocardiogram, echocardiography) in infancy

Testing for immunodeficiency (particularly plasma Ig levels, lymphocyte subsets, and polysaccharide responsiveness); although limited data on immunodeficiency in individuals with WHS are available, such testing should be considered when clinically appropriate.

Complete blood count to evaluate for hematopoietic dysfunction

Comprehensive evaluation by an otolaryngologist and comprehensive audiologic screening (brain stem auditory evoked responses) as early as possible to allow appropriate interventions

Renal function testing and renal ultrasonography in infancy to detect structural renal anomalies and/or vesicoureteral reflux [Grisaru et al 2000]

Baseline liver ultrasound to evaluate for hepatic adenoma

Consultation with a medical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
