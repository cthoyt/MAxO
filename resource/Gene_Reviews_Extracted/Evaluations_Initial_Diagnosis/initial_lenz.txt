To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Lenz microphthalmia syndrome (LMS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Physical examination for the presence of anomalies associated with the disorder

Cranial MRI to estimate the size of the globes for prognosis regarding potential visual function and to detect concurrent CNS malformations such as hypoplastic corpus callosum and cingulate gyrus

Visual evoked response testing and ophthalmologic examination to help determine visual acuity and/or the potential for vision

Consideration of echocardiogram if physical exam detects findings suggestive of a congenital cardiac malformation. (A single case report from Japan described an infant with a molecularly confirmed LMS (BCOR p.Pro85Leu) dying of an unspecified cardiac defect at age six months [Suzumori et al 2013].)

Renal ultrasound examination to evaluate for renal aplasia, hypoplasia, and hydroureter

Consideration of hearing evaluation during infancy if:

Head and neck examination reveals malformations of the auricle or ear canal, presence of skin tags or dimples around the ear, presence of cleft lip or palate, asymmetric facies, and microcephaly

The parents have concerns that the child cannot hear (e.g., infant does not startle to loud noises, awaken to sound). The type of examination should be adjusted for the individual's cognitive level to allow for cooperation and maximize the chance of an informative test (see Deafness and Hereditary Hearing Loss Overview).

Consideration of sleep evaluation if parents report excessive daytime somnolence, altered sleep-wake cycles, difficulty awakening the child or getting the child to fall asleep, apnea, loud snoring, and/or difficulty breathing while asleep

Clinical genetics consultation
