To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with an ACTG2-related disorder (which can range from megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome [MMIHS] to chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction [CIPO]), the following evaluations are recommended:

Clinical genetics consultation with complete family history

Urologic. Consultation with an expert in in pediatric urology whose evaluation may include studies of upper and lower urinary tract and renal function

Gastrointestinal. Consultation with an expert in pediatric gastroenterology whose evaluation may include radiologic studies of the gastrointestinal tract based on the symptoms and onset. Of note, most individuals with an ACTG2-related disorder will have undergone extensive radiographic imaging prenatally and/or in the neonatal period including evaluation for gastrointestinal distention and/or microcolon. However, if not performed at the time of diagnosis, studies to clarify the extent of disease could include abdominal x-rays, abdominal CT, transit studies (i.e., small bowel contrast studies), and/or endoscopy. Manometry (which typically shows reduced or absent contractions) can be used as an adjunct in the evaluation to quantify the degree of hypoperistalsis and extent of gastrointestinal dysfunction [Ambartsumyan & Rodriguez 2014].

Nutrition. Consultation with a specialist in pediatric nutrition that includes plotting of height and weight on standardized growth charts and assessments of dietary intake, body mass index, and nutritional status (measurement of albumin and prealbumin, and tests of liver function)
