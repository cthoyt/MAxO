To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with congenital muscular dystrophy, the following evaluations are recommended:

Neurologic examination

Assessment of respiratory function with baseline pulmonary function tests, including forced vital capacity (FVC) in sitting and supine positions and blood gas exchange

Polysomnography to identify individuals with nocturnal hypoventilation, to evaluate individuals with symptoms of hypercapnea (daytime headache, restless sleep, loss of concentration), and to evaluate individuals with reduced forced vital capacity, particularly those with CMD subtypes associated with a rigid spine, axial weakness, and/or signs of diaphragmatic weakness (detected by a drop in FVC from sitting to supine). Additional indications for polysomnography include testing in the very young or those with developmental delay in whom reliable, consistent pulmonary function testing can be difficult to obtain.

Sleep-disordered breathing can be seen with FVC of less than 60%, while nocturnal hypoventilation correlates with FVC of less than 40% [Wallgren-Pettersson et al 2004, Shahrizaila et al 2006]. Independent of the FVC values, a very high suspicion for nocturnal hypoventilation must be maintained in those with SELENON (SEPN1)-related CMD to avoid a life-threatening respiratory failure.

Radiologic examinations if spinal deformity is observed. Assessment of spine and joint deformities by physiatrists and orthopedists

Feeding and nutritional assessment, weight and height measurement, serum vitamin D concentration and calculation of body mass index (BMI)

Assessment of strength and joint contractures by an occupational therapist and physical therapist

Assessment of cardiac function in those with a dystroglycanopathy or L-CMD, with particular awareness that cardiomyopathy and/or arrhythmia can occur in the absence of severe muscle disease

Evaluation for pulmonary hypertension and/or secondary right heart failure in those with significant respiratory involvement (mechanical ventilation, severe respiratory failure)

Complete eye examination in those with a dystroglycanopathy or if clinically indicated
