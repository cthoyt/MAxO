To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with alpha-mannosidosis, the following evaluations are recommended:

Medical history including evidence of hearing loss, weight loss, headache, fatigue, irritability, depression; change in social, domestic, school- or work-related activities or in ability to walk distances; diarrhea or incontinence, abdominal pain, muscle pain, joint aches, reduced range of movement, and bone pain

Physical examination including otoscopy, ophthalmoscopy, assessment of liver and spleen size, auscultation of heart and lungs, neurologic status including gait, and orthopedic evaluation including joint range of motion. In children, attention to growth (plot height, weight, and especially head circumference using standardized growth charts)

Examination by an otolaryngologist to detect impaired hearing and middle-ear infections

Audiometry. If intellectual disability or young age makes cooperation difficult, brain stem evoked response testing

Ophthalmologic examination to evaluate for corneal opacities, myopia, hyperopia, and strabismus

Neuropsychological testing to establish functional level and learning capacity

Blood tests. PLOT and C-reactive protein for evidence of inflammation, serum concentrations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) for evaluation of concomitant liver disease and creatinine for assessment of renal function. Clinical examination and immunologic tests (e.g., antinuclear antibodies, anti-ds-DNA antibodies) to exclude systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are recommended.

Skeletal assessment. Plain radiographs of the head, knees (anterior-posterior view), spine (lateral view) and any symptomatic sites

Bone densitometry to detect osteopenia or osteoporosis

CT scan of the brain to evaluate the size of the ventricles and shape and size of the cerebellum, particularly if signs and symptoms of hydrocephalus are present (e.g., headache, increasing gait ataxia, nausea, papilledema)

Clinical genetics consultation
