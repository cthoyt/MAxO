To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with neonatal diabetes mellitus as a result of pathogenic variants in ABCC8 or KCNJ11, a complete neurologic evaluation should be performed.

To establish the extent of disease in an individual with suspected or confirmed pathogenic variants in PDX1, imaging of the pancreas and evaluation of pancreatic exocrine function (stool elastase, serum concentrations of fat-soluble vitamins) should be performed.

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor should be obtained early in the evaluation of PNDM.
