To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with X-linked infantile spinal muscular atrophy (XL-SMA), the following evaluations are recommended:

Nutrition/feeding

Determine if caloric intake is adequate.

Determine if dysphagia and/or fatigue during feeding are present [Iannaccone 2007]; consider swallowing evaluation, especially if aspiration is suspected [Wang et al 2007].

Determine if gastrostomy tube placement and fundoplication are indicated.

Respiratory function

Assess respiratory rate, work of breathing, presence of paradoxic breathing, chest wall shape, and skin perfusion.

Perform baseline pulmonary studies to determine extent of restrictive airway disease and cough efficiency.

Perform sleep evaluation to assess for sleep-disordered breathing including nocturnal hypoventilation and oxygen desaturation [Wang et al 2007].

Orthopedic evaluation to assess contractures

Neurologic evaluation to assess muscle tone and help guide supportive management [Iannaccone 2007]

Clinical genetics consultation
