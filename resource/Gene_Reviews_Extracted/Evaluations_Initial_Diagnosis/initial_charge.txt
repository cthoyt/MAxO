To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with CHARGE syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended:

Dilated ophthalmologic examination by pediatric ophthalmologist to determine the type and extent of the coloboma and associated findings such as strabismus, refractive error, or central vision impairment (CVI); when possible, clinical testing of visual fields

Cardiac evaluation for cardiovascular anomalies

Assessment for unilateral or bilateral choanal atresia and/or stenosis by nasal endoscopy or CT scan

ENT and audiologic evaluation:

In infants, brain stem auditory evoked response (BAER) to evaluate hearing as soon as the infant is medically stable

In older children and adults, hearing evaluation as appropriate for age and developmental status

See Deafness and Hereditary Hearing Loss Overview for discussion of types of audiologic evaluation.

CT scan of the temporal bones to evaluate for middle ear and inner ear defects

Evaluation for cleft palate, including submucous cleft palate

Assessment of cranial nerve function by physical examination for evidence of facial palsy and by swallowing studies

Evaluation for esophageal atresia or tracheoesophageal (TE) fistula with posteroanterior and lateral plain chest radiographs and radiographic visualization of a rigid nasogastric tube that fails to pass from the mouth to the stomach (Contrast-enhanced studies may be necessary to identify or locate a fistula.)

Renal ultrasound examination

Clinical genetics consultation
