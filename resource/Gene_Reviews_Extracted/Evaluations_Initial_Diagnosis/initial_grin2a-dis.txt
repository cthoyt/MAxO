To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with a GRIN2A-related speech disorder and epilepsy, the following evaluations are recommended:

Consultation with a speech and language pathologist

Epilepsy consultation (if not done at the time of initial assessment)

Sleep-deprived or sleep EEG with monitoring to capture slow-wave sleep (if not done at the time of initial assessment), as this is essential to diagnosing or excluding continuous spike-and-wave in sleep (CSWS).

Neuropsychological assessment

Hearing testing

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
