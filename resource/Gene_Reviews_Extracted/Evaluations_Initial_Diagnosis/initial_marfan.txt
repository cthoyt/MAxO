To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Marfan syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended:

Evaluation by an ophthalmologist with expertise in Marfan syndrome, including:

Slit lamp examination through a maximally dilated pupil to see lens subluxation

Refraction and visual correction, especially in young children at risk for amblyopia

Specific assessment for glaucoma and cataract

Evaluation for skeletal manifestations that may require immediate attention by an orthopedist (e.g., severe scoliosis)

Echocardiography
