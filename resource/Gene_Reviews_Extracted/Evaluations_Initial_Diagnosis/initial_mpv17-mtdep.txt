To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with MPV17-related hepatocerebral mtDNA depletion syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended.

Hepatic

Liver function including liver transaminases (ALT and AST), GGT, albumin, total and direct bilirubin, and coagulation profile (PT and PTT)

Ultrasound examination to assess liver size and texture, and for the presence of masses

Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) to screen for hepatocellular carcinoma

Hepatology/liver transplantation consultation

Neurologic

Developmental evaluation

Neurologic consultation and comprehensive neurologic examination

Brain MRI to assess white matter and other abnormalities. The brain MRI findings can establish the degree of central nervous system involvement and serve as a baseline for monitoring the progression of the neurologic disease.

Nerve conduction velocity (NCV) to assess peripheral neuropathy. NCV can establish the degree of the peripheral nervous system involvement and serve as a baseline for monitoring the progression of the neurologic disease.

EEG if seizures are suspected

Nutritional evaluation

Plasma lactate and glucose concentration

Urinalysis and amino acids to assess for renal tubulopathy

Gastrointestinal consultation if gastrointestinal dysmotility is present

Ophthalmologic examination to assess corneal sensation and possible corneal ulcers/scaring

Clinical genetics consultation
