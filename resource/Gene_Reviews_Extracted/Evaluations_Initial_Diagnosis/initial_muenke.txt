To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Muenke syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended:

Assessment of suture involvement by skull radiographs or preferably 3D skull CT

Assessment for hydrocephalus with brain CT or MRI

Assessment for exposure keratopathy

Hearing assessment

Developmental assessment in children

Ophthalmologic assessment including screening for strabismus and vision. Additionally, this assessment should include fundoscopy to assess for papilledema, a finding that is present when intracranial pressure (ICP) is increased.

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
