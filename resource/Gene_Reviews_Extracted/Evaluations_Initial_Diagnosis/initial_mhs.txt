To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS), the following evaluations are recommended if they have not already been completed:

Arterial blood gas analysis; serum concentration of electrolytes, lactate, and CK; coagulation studies; presence of myoglobin in the urine and elevated myoglobin levels in serum.

Continuous core temperature monitoring until the syndrome has resolved

Measurement of serum CK concentrations until normalized

Family history of anesthetic complications

Once the syndrome has resolved, neurologic assessment for evidence of muscle damage

Clinical genetics consultation
