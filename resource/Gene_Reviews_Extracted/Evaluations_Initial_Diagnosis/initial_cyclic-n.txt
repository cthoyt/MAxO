To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with ELANE-related neutropenia, the following are recommended:

Dental examination for gingival and periodontal disease

Evaluation (particularly of those with severe congenital neutropenia) by an otolaryngologist and pulmonologist for chronic sinopulmonary inflammation and deep abscesses

Evaluation of individuals with severe congenital neutropenia for evidence of myelodysplasia or leukemia
