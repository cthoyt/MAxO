The initial step following diagnosis of Î²-thalassemia in an individual is to distinguish between those who have thalassemia intermedia (requiring intermittent transfusions on an as-needed basis) from those with thalassemia major (who need a regular transfusion program). See Establishing the Diagnosis.

The following should be included in the investigations when deciding whom to transfuse:

Confirmed diagnosis of thalassemia

Hemoglobin level <7 g/dl on 2 occasions, > 2 weeks apart (excluding all other contributory causes such as infections)

OR, presence of the following features, regardless of hemoglobin level:

Facial changes

Poor growth

Bony fractures

Clinically significant extramedullary hematopoiesis.
