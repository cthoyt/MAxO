To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with liver PhK deficiency, the following evaluations are recommended:

Measurement of blood glucose concentration (normal >70 mg/dL) for two to three days: upon waking in the morning; prior to meals and night time supplementation with oral cornstarch; and after activity

Measurement of blood ketone levels for two to three days: upon waking in the morning; prior to meals and night time supplementation with oral cornstarch; and after activity. Elevated blood ketones (beta-hydroxybutyrate >1.0 mmol/L) could be an indicator of suboptimal metabolic control and pending hypoglycemia.

Liver imaging, if not performed in the past year. The type of liver imaging (ultrasound, MRI, or CT) is determined by factors such as age and underlying liver status (such as liver cirrhosis).

Basic metabolic panel including liver enzymes (AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase)

Prothrombin time

Lipid panel (cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations)

Serum creatine kinase measurement (Some individuals with liver PhK deficiency can have muscle involvement)

Baseline echocardiogram (Although cardiac problems have not been reported to occur in PhK deficiency [due to paucity of systematic investigation and lack of knowledge], baseline echocardiogram may be done as a precaution.)

To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with muscle PhK deficiency, the following evaluations are suggested:

Physical therapy evaluation

Serum creatine kinase measurement
