To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with a TBC1D24-related disorder, the following evaluations are recommended:

DOORS syndrome

Clinical genetics consultation, including dysmorphology examination

Neurology consultation

Audiology consultation

Otolaryngology consultation

Ophthalmology consultation

Dental consultation

Heart ultrasound

Renal ultrasound examination

FIME, PME, EIEE16, and TBC1D24-related nonsyndromic deafness syndromes (DFNA65 and DFNB86). One should consider some of the above evaluations depending on the clinical signs since the clinical overlap of all TBC1D24-related conditions has not yet been fully studied.
