To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), the following are recommended if they have not already been completed:

Neurologic examination for dystonia, rigidity, choreoathetosis, and spasticity, including evaluation of ambulation and speech

Ophthalmologic assessment for evidence of retinopathy

Screening developmental assessment, with referral for more formal testing if delay is indicated

Assessment for physical therapy, occupational therapy, and/or speech therapy

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
