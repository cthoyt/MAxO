To establish the extent of disease and needs of a child diagnosed with LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy following the initial diagnosis, the following are recommended:

Assessment of feeding, nutrition, and bone health: measurement of weight and serum concentrations of vitamin D and calcium

Systematic inquiry of parents/caregivers regarding digestive complications, in particular dysphagia, GE-reflux, and constipation. Frequent choking, prolonged feeding, and nocturnal cough may identify swallowing and gastroesophageal disorders. Additional assessment may include endoscopy, manometry, PH-meter studies, and videofluoroscopy.

Lung function tests that ideally include spirometry (forced vital capacity, forced expired volume in the first second [FEV-1]) and assessment of cough effectiveness (cough peak flow and maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures)

Evaluate older children with an FVC lower than 60% of the predicted value with polysomnography or, if polysomnography is not routinely performed, overnight oximetry.

In those using orthopedic trunk braces or orthoses, assess pulmonary function with and without the brace to determine whether thoracic excursion (and thus ventilator function) is impaired.

Evaluation for nocturnal hypoventilation in children with a history of recurrent respiratory infections, failure to thrive, poor cry, and/or feeding fatigue

Physical therapy assessment of muscle strength and joint mobility

Assessment of the spine by an orthopedist regarding the need for early bracing

Evaluation by a child neurologist for seizures or unexplained fainting or loss of consciousness.

Developmental assessment

Neuropsychological testing if learning or behavioral deficiencies are identified

Evaluation by a cardiologist including electrocardiogram and echocardiogram

Evaluation of respite care services for caregivers

Educational planning to place the child with necessary support in the least restrictive educational environment
