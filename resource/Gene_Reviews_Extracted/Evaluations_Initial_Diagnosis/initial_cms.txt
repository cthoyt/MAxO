To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Neurologic/neuropediatric examination. Assessment of strength and motor function; in children, assessment of motor, speech, and cognitive development

Respiratory care. Assessment of respiratory function with baseline pulmonary function tests including forced vital capacity in sitting and supine positions and blood gas exchange. Polysomnography to identify individuals with nocturnal hypoventilation. Symptoms of hypercapnea that should be discussed: daytime headache, restless sleep, loss of concentration, snoring, recurrent respiratory infections, and weight loss. Respiratory studies may be normal between episodes in patients who experience acute crises.

Assessment of contractures and joint deformities by physiatrists and orthopedists; radiologic examinations if spinal deformity is observed

Speech therapy evaluation if dysarthria and/or hypernasal speech is present

For early-onset forms, assessment of feeding abilities (sucking, swallowing, gastroesophageal reflux) and growth parameters to determine the need for feeding interventions such as gavage feeding or gastrostomy insertion

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
