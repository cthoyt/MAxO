To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with arterial tortuosity syndrome (ATS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Echocardiography. Aortic root measurements must be interpreted based on consideration of normal values for age and body size [Roman et al 1989].

MRA or CT scan with 3D reconstruction from head to pelvis to evaluate arterial tortuosity and identify arterial aneurysms and/or stenoses throughout the arterial tree

Lung function test and imaging (radiographs, CT-scan) when emphysema is suspected

Skeletal radiographs depending on the clinical findings (e.g., scoliosis).

Consideration of bone densitometry based on patient history (fractures), sex, habits (smoking, alcohol consumption, sedentary life style) and age

Evaluation of the palate to identify patients with a highly arched palate, bifid uvula, or cleft palate who may be at risk for orthodontic complications including dental crowding (see Surveillance). Patients with bifid uvula and cleft palate may be at risk for feeding difficulties.

Eye examination by an ophthalmologist with expertise in connective tissue disorders that includes: refraction and correction of refractive errors, especially in young children at risk for amblyopia; specific assessment for keratoconus, keratoglobus, and corneal thinning

Clinical genetics consultation
