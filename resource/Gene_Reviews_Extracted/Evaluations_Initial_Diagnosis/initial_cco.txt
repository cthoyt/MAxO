To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with central core disease (CCD), the following evaluations are recommended:

Neurologic examination with attention to features of congenital myopathy (hypotonia, failure to thrive, joint contractures, scoliosis), weakness of the limbs, and muscle cramps

Physical and occupational therapy assessments

Evaluation for feeding difficulties, including assessment for sucking and ability to swallow

Pulmonary function testing in most patients, especially those with scoliosis, hypotonia, signs of respiratory distress, and/or history of recurrent chest infections. History should be taken for symptoms of nocturnal hypoxia including early morning headaches, daytime drowsiness, loss of appetite, and deteriorating school performance.

Clinical genetics consultation
