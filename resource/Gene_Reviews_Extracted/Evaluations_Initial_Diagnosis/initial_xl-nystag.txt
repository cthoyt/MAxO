Evaluation of visual acuity at different gaze positions [Yang et al 2005]

Recording eye movements to evaluate the nystagmus waveform:

Amplitude, frequency, and conjugacy

Foveation dynamics

Null point width determination

In individuals with periodic alternating nystagmus, recording of cycle duration and the presence of an alternating head posture
