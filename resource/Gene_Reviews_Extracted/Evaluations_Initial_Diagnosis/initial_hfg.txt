To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with hand-foot-genital syndrome (HFGS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Physical examination and radiographs of the hands and feet to evaluate for characteristic abnormalities (e.g., small thumbs, fifth-finger clinodactyly) that may affect hand function

Urologic assessment of bladder/ureter function and urethral competence or position, including renal ultrasound examination and voiding cystourethrogram; examination for UPJ obstruction

Gynecologic examination prior to menstruation or pregnancy for evidence of incomplete MÃ¼llerian fusion, longitudinal vaginal septum, or extremely small hymenal opening. Evaluation may include ultrasound, hysterosalpingogram, hysteroscopy, sonohysterogram, MRI, or other imaging studies. Such studies could be accomplished at the same time as urologic imaging.
