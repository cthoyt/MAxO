After the initial diagnosis, all individuals with fibrous dysplasia/McCune-Albright syndrome (FD/MAS) should be evaluated to determine the extent of disease. The authors recommend the following studies:

Skeleton

FD evaluation. See Fibrous Dysplasia Evaluation (pdf).

Total body bone scintigraphy to identify and determine the extent of FD [Collins et al 2005]. The majority of clinically significant skeletal lesions are apparent on bone scan by age five years.

Imaging of areas of FD identified with bone scintigraphy with radiographs (axial and appendicular FD) and/or computed tomography (craniofacial FD) to more clearly evaluate the extent and anatomy of the lesions

Baseline ophthalmologic, otolaryngologic, and audiologic evaluations in persons with craniofacial FD

Endocrine

In individuals with clinical signs or a previous history of precocious puberty: biochemical screening, pelvic ultrasound examination (females), and bone age examination. See Gonadal Evaluation in Girls (pdf).

Ultrasound examination of the testes (in all males) to evaluate for subclinical disease. See Gonadal Evaluation in Boys (pdf).

Growth hormone excess evaluation (pdf)

A thorough history and physical examination and review of a growth chart (if available) to evaluate for clinical signs of endocrinopathies

Biochemical screening for hyperthyroidism, growth hormone excess (IGF-1 level), and FGF23-mediated hypophosphatemia

Ultrasound examination of the thyroid gland to evaluate for subclinical disease. See Thyroid Evaluation (pdf).

Adrenal evaluation (pdf)

Less common manifestations. Consideration should be given to the less common manifestations cited in Clinical Description with appropriate clinical evaluations and imaging/biochemical studies performed as indicated. See Gastrointestinal Evaluation (pdf).
