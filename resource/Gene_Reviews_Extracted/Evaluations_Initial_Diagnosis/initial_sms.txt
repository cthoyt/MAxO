To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Complete review of systems at the time of diagnosis

Physical and neurologic examination

Renal ultrasound examination to evaluate for possible renal/urologic anomalies (~20% of individuals with SMS), including urologic workup if a history of frequent urinary tract infections exists

Echocardiogram to evaluate for possible cardiac anomalies (<45% of individuals with SMS); follow up depending on the severity of any cardiac anomaly identified

Spine radiographs to evaluate for possible vertebral anomalies and scoliosis (~60%)

Routine blood chemistries, qualitative immunoglobulins, fasting lipid profile (evaluation for hypercholesterolemia), and thyroid function studies

Ophthalmologic evaluation with attention to evidence of strabismus, microcornea, iris anomalies, and refractive error

Comprehensive speech/language pathology evaluation

Assessment of caloric intake, signs and symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), swallowing abilities, and oral motor skills with referral as warranted for full diagnostic evaluation

Otolaryngologic evaluation to assess ear, nose, and throat problems, with specific attention to ear physiology and palatal abnormalities (clefting, velopharyngeal insufficiency)

Audiologic evaluation at regular intervals to monitor for conductive and/or sensorineural hearing loss

Multidisciplinary developmental evaluation, including assessment of motor, speech, language, personal-social, general cognitive, and vocational skills

Early evaluation by physical and/or occupational therapists

Sleep history with particular attention to sleep/wake schedules and respiratory function. Sleep diaries may prove helpful in documenting sleep/wake schedules. Evidence of sleep-disordered breathing warrants a polysomnogram (overnight sleep study) to evaluate for obstructive sleep apnea.

EEG in individuals who have clinical seizures to guide the choice of antiepileptic agents. For those without overt seizures, EEG may be helpful to evaluate for possible subclinical events in which treatment may improve attention and/or behavior; a change in behavior or attention warrants reevaluation.

Neuroimaging (MRI or CT scan) in accordance with findings such as seizures and/or motor asymmetry

In individuals with SMS documented to have larger deletions extending into 17p12:

Specific screening for adrenal function

Detailed assessment and attention to peripheral neurologic function in individuals with SMS with large deletions involving PMP22, which is associated with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (HNPP)

Assessment of family support and psychosocial and emotional needs to assist in designing family interventions

Clinical genetics consultation
