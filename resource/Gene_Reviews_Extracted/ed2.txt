Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia 2 (HED2, Clouston syndrome), a thorough examination of the nails, hair, and skin is recommended. Clinical genetics consultation may also be considered.

Treatment of Manifestations

 Dystrophic nails. Artificial nails may improve the appearance of the hands/feet, and may be especially helpful to young girls and women. Hypotrichosis. No special pharmaceutical agent is available to improve hair growth. Alopecia was found to respond to treatment with a combination of topical minoxidil and tretinoin in an individual with probable congenital hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia [Melkote et al 2009]. The individualâ€™s clinical findings were compatible with the clinical diagnosis of HED2; however, the diagnosis was not confirmed with molecular genetic testing. The authors also noted that the efficacy and safety of long-term treatment need to be explored further. Special hair care products may help to manage dry and sparse hair. In many cases, wigs are helpful. Palmoplantar hyperkeratosis. Skin emollients may help relieve palmoplantar hyperkeratosis.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk
