Treatment of MAC Spectrum

 Prosthetic intervention is appropriate in severe microphthalmia and anophthalmia. In many infants, an ocularist can start shortly after birth to expand the palpebral fissures, conjunctival cul-de-sac, and orbit using conformers of progressively increasing size. In some instances, conformers do not adequately expand the orbit, especially horizontally, causing an "hour glass" deformity. An oculoplastic surgeon can help determine the most suitable options for surgical intervention after age six months (when postnatal growth of the orbit can be assessed) and before the age that orbital dimensions are fixed (after which extensive orbital reconstruction may be required). Surgical options include placement of orbital implants of fixed dimensions at one or more surgeries; placement of expandable implants (silicone balloon, hydrophilic polymers); or use of a dermis-fat graft, which has the capability of post-surgical growth. Children with reduced vision may benefit from visual aids and other visual resources as well as early intervention to help optimize psychomotor development, educational endeavors, life skills, and mobility. Protection of the healthy eye in those with unilateral involvement is recommended.
