Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with SYNE1-related autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia (ARCA1): Brain MRI to assess for cerebellar atrophy Nerve conduction studies to rule out a peripheral neuropathy

Treatment of Manifestations

 Individuals with ARCA1 should be followed by a neurologist and eventually a physiatrist as well. As the disease progresses, individuals need walking aids such as a cane, a walker, and ultimately a wheelchair. 
            Surveillance Yearly evaluation by a neurologist or physiatrist to prescribe walking aids is appropriate.

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid

 People with ARCA1 should be advised to avoid employment that may put them at risk of falls or that may require a high degree of physical dexterity.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk
