Individuals with POLG-related disorders require frequent examination and interval evaluation by a team comprising the following:

Primary care provider

Neurologist

Clinical geneticist

Hepatologist or gastroenterologist

Physiatrist

Psychiatrist

Ophthalmologist

Pulmonologist

Laboratory tests. No standard of care guidelines are available to suggest the frequency for which the following tests should be obtained. Testing should be guided by clinical features and the proposed schedule should be modified if the clinical course is stable. For those with the most severe phenotypes, the following could be considered:

Every three months. CBC; electrolytes, liver enzymes (AST, ALT, GGT); CK, liver function tests including: preprandial serum glucose concentration; serum concentration of ammonia, albumin, bilirubin (free and conjugated), and cholesterol; and prothrombin time or INR as a measure of coagulation factors

Annually. Urine analysis; serum concentration of lactic acid

Biannually. Plasma amino acids; urine organic acids; plasma concentration of free and total carnitine (unless treated with levocarnitine, in which case measure annually)

Imaging and diagnostic procedures

Liver ultrasound examination annually

EEG and video EEG monitoring (e.g., for suspicion of subclinical status epilepticus; presence of epilepsia partialis continua; need to determine if events are seizures or non-epileptic movements)

Audiogram and brain stem auditory evoked responses as clinically indicated

Barium swallow study as clinically indicated

Polysomnogram with CPAP titration as part of an evaluation of subacute mental status changes or every two to three years
