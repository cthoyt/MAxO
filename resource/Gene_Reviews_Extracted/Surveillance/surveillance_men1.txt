Routine surveillance using biochemical testing and imaging is recommended for asymptomatic individuals with an MEN1 pathogenic variant and others at risk for MEN1 syndrome-associated tumors (i.e., those known to have MEN1 syndrome and those with an affected parent who have not undergone molecular genetic testing); surveillance should begin in early childhood and continue for life. Early detection and treatment of the potentially malignant neuroendocrine tumors should reduce the morbidity and mortality of MEN1 syndrome. Such screening can detect the onset of the disease about ten years before symptoms develop, thereby providing an opportunity for earlier treatment [Bassett et al 1998].

MEN1 Minimal Surveillance Program 

For individuals known to have MEN1 syndrome or a family-specific pathogenic variant in MEN1 2, 3

Biochemical investigations

Yearly, beginning at the specified age:

Serum concentration of prolactin, IGF-1, fasting glucose and insulin from age five years 2

Fasting total serum calcium concentration (corrected for albumin) and/or ionized-serum calcium concentration, chromogranin–A, pancreatic polypeptide, glucagon, vasocative intestinal peptide for other pancreatic NET from age eight years 2

Fasting serum gastrin concentration from age 20 years 2

To be considered: fasting serum concentration of intact (full-length) PTH

Imaging

Every three to five years beginning at the specified age; the interval depending on whether there is biochemical evidence of a neoplasia and/or signs and symptoms of an MEN1-related tumor 2:

Head MRI from age five years 2

Abdominal CT or MRI from age 20 years 2

To be considered: yearly chest CT, somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) octreotide scan

2. According to the International Guidelines for Diagnosis and Therapy of MEN Type 1 and Type 2 [Brandi et al 2001], and Clinical Practice Guidelines for MEN Type 1 [Thakker et al 2012]

3. Can be modified according to clinical suspicion and/or findings in an individual

For individuals at 50% risk of having MEN1 syndrome in whom genetic status is unknown

Biochemical investigations. Yearly, beginning at the specified age:

Serum concentration of prolactin from age five years

Fasting total serum calcium concentration (corrected for albumin) and/or ionized-serum calcium concentration from age ten years

Fasting serum concentration of intact (full-length) PTH from age ten years

Fasting serum gastrin concentration if individual has symptoms of ZES (reflux or diarrhea) from age 20 years
