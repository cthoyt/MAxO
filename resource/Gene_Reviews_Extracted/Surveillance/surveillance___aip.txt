In view of the high risk for HCC in individuals with AIP in Sweden, annual hepatic imaging is offered after age 50 years. It has been shown to improve survival [Innala & Andersson 2011]. A few other countries have also initiated screening. It is not yet clear whether similar testing should be offered more widely, since the risk appears to be low in some countries [Deybach & Puy 2011, Stewart 2012]. Note: Serum Î±-fetoprotein measurement is not helpful.
