In persons with clinically mild disease, episodes of subtle, undiagnosed hypoglycemia can cause permanent brain damage. Therefore close monitoring and vigilance is just as critical in mild cases as it is in severe cases. Furthermore, in persons with mild disease and in those with severe disease in clinical remission, severe hypoglycemia may be precipitated by intercurrent viral illness. Thus, it is imperative that parents monitor glucose concentrations closely especially during intercurrent illness, even in the absence of symptomatic hypoglycemia.
