Frequency of testing depends on the center; however, as a guide, the following are recommended:

Quarterly. Assessment of renal function, blood pressure, and hematocrit

Six monthly to annually. Renal imaging (ultrasound or CT examination) to assess renal stone burden*

Annually. Examination for involvement of the skin, bone, eye, or thyroid*

For pregnant women with PH2, close monitoring by both an obstetrician and nephrologist because of the increased risk of developing nephrolithiasis during pregnancy or after delivery

*Investigations should likely occur more often in newly diagnosed symptomatic individuals or in children younger than age two to three years.
