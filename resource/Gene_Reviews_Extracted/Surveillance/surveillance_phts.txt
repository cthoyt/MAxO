The most serious consequences of PHTS relate to the increased risk of cancers including breast, thyroid, endometrial, and to a lesser extent, renal. In this regard, the most important aspect of management of any individual with a PTEN pathogenic variant is increased cancer surveillance to detect any tumors at the earliest, most treatable stages. Current suggested screening by age follows:

Cowden Syndrome

Pediatric (age <18 years)

Yearly thyroid ultrasound examination** (on identification of a PTEN pathogenic variant)

Yearly skin check with physical examination

Adult

Yearly thyroid ultrasound** and dermatologic evaluation

Women beginning at age 30 years:

Monthly breast self-examination**

Yearly breast screening (at minimum mammogram); MRI may also be incorporated.**

Yearly transvaginal ultrasound or endometrial biopsy**

For men and women:

Colonoscopy beginning at age 35 years**; frequency dependent on degree of polyposis identified

Biennial renal imaging (CT or MRI preferred) beginning at age 40 years**

** For those with a family history of a particular cancer type at an early age screening may be initiated five to ten years prior to the youngest diagnosis in the family. For example, in a woman whose mother developed breast cancer at age 30 years breast surveillance may begin at age 25-30 years.

Note: Although the NCCN Guidelines removed endometrial surveillance after 2007 (without expert PHTS input), it is prudent to ensure the minimal surveillance for endometrial cancer as detailed if family history is positive for endometrial cancer.

Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba Syndrome

Screening recommendations have not been established for BRRS. Given recent molecular epidemiologic studies, however, individuals with BRRS and a germline PTEN pathogenic variant should undergo the same surveillance as individuals with CS.

Individuals with BRRS should also be monitored for complications related to gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyposis, which can be more severe than in CS.

Proteus Syndrome/Proteus-Like Syndrome

Although the observation of germline PTEN pathogenic variants in a minority of individuals who meet the clinical diagnostic criteria for Proteus syndrome and Proteus-like syndrome is relatively new, clinicians should consider instituting the CS surveillance recommendations for individuals with these disorders who have germline PTEN pathogenic variants.
