During vitamin E therapy, the plasma vitamin E concentration should be measured at regular intervals (e.g., every 6 months), especially in children. Ideally the plasma vitamin E concentration should be maintained in the high normal range.

Some protocols call for measuring the total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter of plasma (TRAP). Although α-tocopherol only contributes 5%-10% to TRAP, this parameter appears to be the best surrogate marker for clinical improvement [Schuelke et al 1999]. Discontinuation of vitamin E supplementation, even temporarily, leads to a drop in plasma vitamin E concentration within two to three days and to a prolonged drop in TRAP, even after reinitiating vitamin E supplementation [Kohlschütter et al 1997, Schuelke et al 2000b].
