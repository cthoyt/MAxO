Guidelines for surveillance have been developed [Scarpa et al 2011].

Modes of surveillance for complications over time depend, like treatment, on organ system and disease severity. Because all persons with MPS II face the same organ failure issues, with the time of failure being dependent on severity, when and how often to monitor for change cannot be generalized. However, the following studies/evaluations are likely indicated on at least a yearly basis beginning in early to mid-childhood:

Cardiology visit with echocardiogram

Pulmonary clinic visit with pulmonary function testing

Audiogram

Eye examination, including examination through a dilated pupil to view the optic disc

Developmental assessment

Neurologic examination

The following are appropriate at baseline and/or when symptoms/age dictates:

Sleep study for obstructive sleep apnea

NCV study for evidence of carpal tunnel syndrome

Head/neck MRI to document ventricular size and cervicomedullary narrowing

Opening pressure on lumbar puncture

Orthopedic evaluation to monitor hip disease
