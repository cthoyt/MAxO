The following evaluations should be performed every three to four months when children are actively growing. Evaluation may be less often thereafter. The frequency of evaluation should vary depending on individual needs [Speiser et al 2010].

Efficacy of glucocorticoid replacement therapy is monitored by measurement of the following:

Early-morning serum concentrations of 17-OHP, Î”4-androstenedione, and testosterone approximately every three months during infancy and every three to six months thereafter. (In some instances, measurement of urinary pregnantriols and 17 ketosteroids in a 24-hour urine sample may help assess hormonal control. However, the process of urine collection makes it less practical than a simple blood draw.)

Linear growth, weight gain, pubertal development, and clinical signs of cortisol and androgen excess

Bone age to assess osseous maturation (at 6- to 12-month intervals)

Efficacy of mineralocorticoid replacement therapy is monitored by measurement of the following:

Blood pressure

Early morning plasma renin activity or direct renin assay in a controlled position (usually upright)

Monitoring for testicular abnormalities in males. Periodic imaging of the testes either by ultrasonography or MRI should begin after puberty and be repeated every three to five years.

Monitoring fertility and metabolic risks in adults. In affected adults, periodic measurements and/or monitoring of the following should be performed:

Fecundity and fertility

Weight

Lipid profile

Blood pressure

Bone mineral density

Imaging studies. No routine adrenal imaging or bone mineral density is recommended [Speiser et al 2010].
