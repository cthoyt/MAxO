Routine assessment of neurologic status on physical examination

Orthopedic evaluation upon the development of joint contractures or joint hypermobility [Wilcox et al 1998]

Audiology assessment

CT to evaluate for craniocervical constriction in long-term survivors if respiratory insufficiency is potentially the result of compression of the brain stem at the craniocervical junction

EEG for seizure activity
