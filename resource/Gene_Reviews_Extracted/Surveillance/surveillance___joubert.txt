Because no uniformly reliable distinguishing characteristics allow prediction of the complications that may develop in an infant or young child with Joubert syndrome, a number of annual evaluations are recommended (see also Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders Foundation web site):

Pediatric and neurologic evaluation and monitoring of growth, sexual maturation, breathing (including apnea symptoms), and motor function

Neuropsychological and developmental evaluation and testing, as appropriate

Ophthalmologic evaluation for visual acuity, tracking ability, and development of retinal dystrophy

Abdominal ultrasound examination for evaluation of possible liver and kidney abnormalities

Liver function tests

Evaluation of renal function: measurement of blood pressure, serum concentrations of BUN and creatinine, CBC, and assessment of first-morning void urinalysis
