No specific guidelines address the issue of surveillance. The appropriate intervals for monitoring depend on the clinical findings, and need to be more frequent in those with a more severe presentation.

One individual reported in the literature was followed with clinical evaluation and assessment of mineral homeostasis every three months; echocardiography, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and low-dose radiation CT every six months; and x-rays of the wrists and knees every year [Edouard et al 2011].

Another individual was followed with weekly assessment of mineral homeostasis and troponin, monthly echocardiograms, and CT every three to four months [Michael A Levine, personal communication].

When individuals with GACI develop hypophosphatemic rickets that requires treatment with calcitriol and phosphorus supplementation, urine calcium should be followed regularly so as to avoid hypercalciuria.
