The following are recommended:

Routine follow up with an ophthalmologist in all individuals with an NDP-related retinopathy, even when vision is severely reduced

Given that most individuals with the NDP-related spectrum of retinopathies are blind, routine monitoring of hearing so that hearing loss can be detected early and managed appropriately

Observation for clinical evidence of venous stasis or ulcer disease
