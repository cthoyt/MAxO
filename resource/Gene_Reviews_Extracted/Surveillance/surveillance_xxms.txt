Monitoring during testosterone replacement therapy should include the following:

Evaluation of mood, libido, energy, erectile function, acne, and breast tenderness and size.

Measurement of serum testosterone concentration at three-month intervals (prior to the next injection) to evaluate nadir testosterone concentrations. Concentrations lower than 200 ng/dL or higher than 500 ng/dL may require adjustment of total dose or frequency.

In adults, digital rectal examination and measurement of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) prior to treatment and three, six, and 12 months after initiation of therapy to evaluate for the presence of an overt prostate cancer, which would be a contraindication to the treatment. Such testing should then be performed annually.

For individuals on testosterone replacement therapy, evaluation of hematocrit at three, six, and 12 months, then annually because of risk of increased hematocrit with subsequent risk of hypoxia and sleep apnea

Lipid profile and liver function tests, as testosterone may alter lipid profile and liver function

Bone mineral determination by bone densitometry (DEXA) once a year, if osteopenia has been diagnosed

Ongoing psychosocial support
