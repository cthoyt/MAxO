Annual ECG and echocardiogram or possible cardiac MRI is indicated to detect asymptomatic and progressive cardiac conduction defects and cardiomyopathy.

Some centers perform annual 24-hour Holter monitoring even in the absence of cardiac symptoms.

Fasting serum glucose concentration and glycosylated hemoglobin level should be measured annually.

Males should be tested for hypogonadism if they become increasingly fatigued or have reduced sexual energy, and should be tested every few years even without symptoms to see if they would benefit from replacement therapy.
