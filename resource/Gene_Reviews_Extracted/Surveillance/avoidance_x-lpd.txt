No formal surveillance guidelines exist; the following are general considerations:

Blood should be monitored by EBV-PCR for evidence of EBV infection if symptoms of infection or HLH develop.

Blood counts, hepatic profiles, coagulation studies, and inflammatory markers (ferritin, soluble IL2R) should be monitored as needed based on clinical status for early evidence of HLH.

IgG levels should also be monitored as needed based on clinical phenotype.
