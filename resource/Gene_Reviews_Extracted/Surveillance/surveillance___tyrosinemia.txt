Frequent evaluation of the following parameters is typical in the management of individuals with tyrosinemia type I (Table 3) [CR Scott, personal recommendations].

AFP = alpha-fetoprotein

ALT/AST = alanine transaminase/aspartate transaminase

BUN = blood urea nitrogen

CBC = complete blood count

GGT = gamma-glutamyl transferase

PT/PTT = prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time

MRI with contrast to evaluate for liver adenomas or nodules and for kidney size
