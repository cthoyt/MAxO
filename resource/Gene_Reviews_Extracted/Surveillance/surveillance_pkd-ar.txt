The following should be monitored regularly, depending on disease course and complications:

Blood pressure monitored at periodic physician's visits as well as home blood pressure monitoring if indicated (see Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis)

Renal function in those with chronic kidney disease Stage III or less; close monitoring for the complications of CKD should be undertaken by the treating nephrologist according to standard practices outlined in the KDOQI Guidelines.

Electrolyte balance, monitored by obtaining serum concentrations of sodium, potassium, and chloride. Mineral balance, monitored by assessing calcium and phosphorous. If the calcium level is low, magnesium concentration should be evaluated [Dell et al 2009, Sweeney & Avner 2011, Sweeney & Avner 2014].

Hydration status

Nutritional status, with growth plotted on standard growth charts and nutrition consultation as indicated

Hepatoportal duct involvement, by physical examination and complete blood counts, in addition to serum albumin levels, PT/PTT, and 25-OH vitamin D, vitamin E levels, and fat-soluble vitamin levels

If hepatomegaly is present and/or splenomegaly develops, additional monitoring including periodic ultrasonography or MRI. With hepatosplenomegaly, referral to a pediatric hepatologist is suggested for evaluation and periodic monitoring by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to detect esophageal varices [Telega et al 2013].

Consideration of MR cholangiography, a more sensitive measurement for biliary ectasia, at baseline and then as indicated [Shneider & Magid 2005, Telega et al 2013, Sweeney et al 2016]

Agents to Avoid

The following should be avoided:

For affected individuals with hypertension, sympathomimetic agents

In general, unless the clinical situation warrants their use, known nephrotoxic agents including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and aminoglycosides

Potentially hepatotoxic agents (e.g., acetaminophen doses >30 mg/kg/day, herbal supplements, and alcohol) should be minimized.

Work in cell and animal models suggests that caffeine, theophylline-like agents, and calcium channel blockers may exacerbate renal cyst formation and growth. However, this has not been rigorously studied in individuals with ARPKD or ADPKD.
