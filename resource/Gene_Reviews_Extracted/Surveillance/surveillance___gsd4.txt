No clinical guidelines for surveillance are available.

The following evaluations are suggested with frequency varying according to the severity of the condition:

Liver function tests including liver transaminases, albumin, and coagulation profile (PT and PTT)

Abdominal ultrasound examination

Echocardiogram

Neurologic assessment

Nutritional assessment

Note: If cardiomyopathy was not observed on the baseline screening echocardiogram at the time of initial diagnosis, repeat echocardiograms are recommended every three months during infancy, every six months during early childhood, and annually thereafter.
