Early recognition and treatment of cardiac problems and seizures is important, as these potential complications may be severe and appear to cause premature death [Danek et al 2001a].

If no pathologic findings are identified at initial evaluation, cardiac examinations (Holter ECG and echocardiography) should be repeated every two to three years.

In the case of suspected epilepsy, EEG should be performed. If AED treatment is indicated, medication-specific laboratory parameters and serum concentrations should be followed.

One individual with MLS developed life-threatening rhabdomyolysis; thus, serum CK concentrations should be carefully monitored, in particular if excessive movement disorders are present or if neuroleptic medications are being used [Jung & Brandner 2002].
