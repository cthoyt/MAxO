A general timetable for clinical and laboratory evaluation in thalassemia major has been provided by Thalassemia International Federation [Cappellini et al 2014] and is available at the TIF web site.

For individuals with thalassemia major, follow up to monitor the effectiveness of transfusion therapy and chelation therapy and their side effects includes the following:

Monthly physical examination by a physician familiar with the affected individual and the disease

Every three months: assessment of liver function tests (serum concentration of ALT), determination of serum ferritin concentration, and assessment of growth and development (during childhood)

Annual

Ophthalmologic and audiologic examinations

Complete cardiac evaluation, and evaluation of thyroid, endocrine pancreas, parathyroid, adrenal, and pituitary function

Liver ultrasound evaluation and determination of serum alpha-fetoprotein concentration in adults with hepatitis C and iron overload for early detection of hepatocarcinoma

Bone densitometry to assess for osteoporosis in the adult

Regular gallbladder echography for early detection of cholelithiasis [Origa et al 2009], particularly in individuals with the Gilbert syndrome genotype (i.e., presence of the (TA)7/(TA)7 motif in the UGT1Apromoter)
