Affected individuals require follow up as needed on a "system by system" basis:

Monitoring for hypocalcemia, including ionized calcium level every three to six months in infancy, every five years through childhood, and every one to two years thereafter

Monitoring of calcium levels preoperatively and postoperatively, and regularly during pregnancy

Thyroid studies annually

Reevaluation of immunologic status between age nine and 12 months; consideration of repeat immunologic evaluation prior to any live virus vaccine

Annual complete blood count and differential

Repeat ophthalmologic evaluation between age one and five years, or as needed based on symptoms

Evaluation of nasal speech quality after language emersion to screen for VPI

Repeat audiology evaluation in infancy and prior to school enrollment

Routine surveillance for the development of scoliosis

Routine dental care with consideration of sealants in those individuals with enamel hypoplasia/increased incidence of caries

Regular developmental assessments benefit the child and assist the school in providing appropriate remediation.

Periodic reevaluation by a clinical geneticist can apprise the family of new developments and/or recommendations.
