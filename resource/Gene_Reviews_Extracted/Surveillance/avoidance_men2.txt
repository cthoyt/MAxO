MTC. Approximately 50% of individuals diagnosed with MTC who have undergone total thyroidectomy and neck nodal dissections have recurrent disease [Cohen & Moley 2003]. Furthermore, thyroid glands removed from individuals with a RET pathogenic variant who had normal plasma calcitonin concentrations have been found to contain MTC [Skinner et al 1996]. Therefore, continued monitoring for residual or recurrent MTC is indicated after thyroidectomy, even if thyroidectomy is performed prior to biochemical evidence of disease.

The screening protocol for MTC after prophylactic thyroidectomy is an annual measurement of serum calcitonin [American Thyroid Association Guidelines Task Force 2009]. More frequent follow up is recommended for those with residual disease.

Hypoparathyroidism. All individuals who have undergone thyroidectomy and autotransplantation of the parathyroids need monitoring for possible hypoparathyroidism.

Pheochromocytoma. For individuals whose initial screening results are negative for pheochromocytoma, annual biochemical screening is recommended, followed by MRI and/or CT if the biochemical results are abnormal [Pacak et al 2005, American Thyroid Association Guidelines Task Force 2009]. Women with MEN 2 should be screened for pheochromocytoma prior to a planned pregnancy, or as early as possible during an unplanned pregnancy [American Thyroid Association Guidelines Task Force 2009]. Other screening studies, such as scintigraphy or positron emission tomography, may be warranted in some individuals.

MEN 2A. Annual biochemical screening beginning at age eight years has been recommended for individuals with a pathogenic variant in codons 630 and 634 and at age 20 years for a pathogenic variant in all other codons [American Thyroid Association Guidelines Task Force 2009].

FMTC. Screening as for MEN 2A is indicated, as not all families classified as FMTC are MTC-only [Moers et al 1996].

MEN 2B. Annual screening should begin at age eight years [American Thyroid Association Guidelines Task Force 2009].

Parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia. Annual biochemical screening is recommended for affected individuals who have not had parathyroidectomy and parathyroid autotransplantation.

MEN 2A. Screening should start at age eight years for individuals with a pathogenic variant in codons 630 and 634, and by age 20 years for individuals with other RET pathogenic variants [American Thyroid Association Guidelines Task Force 2009].

FMTC. Periodic screening should begin at age 20 years [American Thyroid Association Guidelines Task Force 2009].

MEN 2B. Screening is unnecessary as individuals with MEN 2B do not have an increased risk of hyperparathyroidism.
