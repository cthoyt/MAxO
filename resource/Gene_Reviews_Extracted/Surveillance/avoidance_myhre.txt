Cardiovascular

After normal baseline evaluations of upper- and lower-extremity blood pressure measurements, two-dimensional echocardiography with Doppler, and cardiology evaluation

In asymptomatic individuals with a normal echocardiogram at the time of initial diagnosis, repeat echocardiogram every 1-3 years. Note that pericardial effusion and restrictive cardiomyopathy may occur at any age and may be clinically asymptomatic [Starr et al 2015, Garavelli et al 2016, Lin et al 2016].

In individuals with abnormal findings at the time of initial diagnosis, more extensive imaging may be indicated given the progressive nature of the disorder (e.g., MRI to evaluate for pericardial thickening or effusion).

Respiratory

Consider oxygen saturation in children, with monitoring as needed for symptoms suggestive of restrictive/obstructive pulmonary disease and annual pulmonary function studies in children older than age six years if able to cooperate with test maneuvers.

Evaluation for upper airway stenosis (e.g., laryngotracheal stenosis) should be considered based on symptoms.

Other

Annual ophthalmologic and audiology evaluations

Monitoring of physical skill development and joint mobility
