Affected individuals should be periodically seen for assessment of vision, trials of correction for refractive error, and when residual vision is present, assessment of the presence of amblyopia, glaucoma, or cataract.

Rarely, vision appears to improve beyond expectations; in such cases, a repeat ERG is indicated.
