While surveillance depends on the specific genetic defect and on the clinical manifestations (see Table 1), it should always include periodic evaluations of the following: neurologic findings, urine analysis (for proteinuria) and renal function, ophthalmologic findings, and hearing.

Note: Because cardiomyopathy to date has been found only in the most severe phenotype (i.e., neonatal onset), cardiac evaluation should be performed at the time of diagnosis, but not periodically unless cardiac involvement has been documented.
