Clinical evaluation for development of orthopedic manifestations (e.g., hand contractures in FMD, scoliosis in FMD and MNS) is appropriate. Head size and shape should be monitored as part of the surveillance for evolving craniosynostosis.

Monitoring of hearing loss should be ongoing, as the sensorineural component can be progressive.
