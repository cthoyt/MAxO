Individuals on long-term anticoagulation require periodic reevaluation of their clinical course to confirm that the benefits of anticoagulation continue to outweigh the bleeding risk.

Selected factor V Leiden heterozygotes who do not require long-term anticoagulation may benefit from evaluation prior to exposure to circumstantial risk factors such as surgery or pregnancy (see Prevention of Primary Manifestations).
