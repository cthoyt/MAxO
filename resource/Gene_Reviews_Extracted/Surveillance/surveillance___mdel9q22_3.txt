The following recommended surveillance is the same as that for Gorlin syndrome (see Gorlin Syndrome).

Head circumference should be followed throughout childhood and plotted on appropriate growth charts. Rapid enlargement should prompt evaluation for possible hydrocephalus.

Awareness of the risk of medulloblastoma in the first years of life is important and may justify developmental assessment and physical examination every six months. No evidence for the efficacy of regular neuroimaging exists; frequent computer tomography (CT) should be avoided because of risks associated with radiation sensitivity.

Orthopantogram is indicated every 12-18 months in individuals older than age eight years to identify jaw keratocysts.

Skin should be examined at least annually; some physicians recommend skin examination by a professional every three to four months.

While there are currently no published guidelines regarding monitoring for intraabdominal embryonal tumors in individuals with 9q22.3 microdeletion, 12% of the published cases have been diagnosed with Wilms tumor. Thus regular abdominal ultrasound for Wilms tumor, similar to surveillance for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, is recommended for individuals with 9q22.3 microdeletion until disproven otherwise.
