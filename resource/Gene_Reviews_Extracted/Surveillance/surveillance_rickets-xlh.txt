Periodic clinical evaluation to assess for disease progression, treatment response, and therapeutic complications is indicated.

For individuals on calcitriol and phosphate therapy the following are recommended:

Quarterly monitoring of the following: serum concentrations of phosphate, calcium, and creatinine; alkaline phosphatase level; intact parathyroid hormone level; and urinary calcium, phosphate, and creatinine to identify and thus prevent therapeutic complications

Intermittent monitoring of lower-extremity x-rays (teleoroentgenograms) to assess skeletal response to treatment. The frequency has not been well established; although annual imaging can be considered, the decision for imaging should be based on symptoms and physical examination findings.

Renal ultrasound examination to assess for nephrocalcinosis. The frequency has not been well established.

Dental follow up twice a year (as for children and teenagers at high risk for caries)
