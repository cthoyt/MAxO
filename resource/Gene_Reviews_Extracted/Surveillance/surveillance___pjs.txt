The surveillance program for the multiple organs at risk for cancer is outlined in Table 4. Note: The effect of such surveillance on morbidity and mortality has not been evaluated in controlled trials.

From birth, an annual history and physical examination with attention to testicular examination and routine blood work is recommended. A boy age 13 years with PJS was recently described as developing an unusually early presentation of small-bowel adenocarcinoma, thus supporting screening in childhood as illustrated in Table 4 [Wangler et al 2013].

MRE = magnetic resonance enterography

MRCP = magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography

1. 

If significant polyps are present at baseline, repeat upper endoscopy/colonoscopy every three years. If no significant polyps are present at baseline, repeat at age 18 years and then every three years.

2. 

CT enterography may be used as an alternative. The use of MR enterography allows for simultaneous surveillance for pancreatic cancer.

3. 

If few or no polyps at baseline, repeat at age 18 years.

4. 

Digital mammography if MRI not available

5. 

Discuss prophylactic mastectomy.

6. 

Discuss prophylactic hysterectomy and oophorectomy.
