If anomalies are found in any system (see Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis), periodic follow up should be planned and life-long monitoring may be necessary; for example, periodic eye examination if a refraction error or strabismus is found, urinalysis if there are structural abnormalities of the collecting system. Despite the apparent increased incidence of hematologic and solid tumor malignancies, no surveillance strategies have been evaluated or recommended.
