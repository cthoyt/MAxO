Monitoring for potential complications that can influence the prognosis of MmD includes the following:

Frequent and regular monitoring of the spine particularly during childhood and adolescence when scoliosis can rapidly progress during the adolescent growth spurt

Careful monitoring of respiratory function from an early stage because of the risk for insidious nocturnal hypoxia and sudden respiratory failure. Monitoring of respiratory function should include the following:

Close attention to nocturnal hypoventilation symptoms including early morning headaches, daytime drowsiness, loss of appetite, and deteriorating school performance

Lung function tests (FEV1 and FVC)

Sleep studies

Assessment of the need for intermittent or permanent ventilation. Nocturnal ventilation, when indicated, may significantly improve the prognosis.

Assessment of cardiac status because of the risk of cardiac impairment secondary to respiratory involvement

Growth should be assessed regularly.

Regular neuromuscular evaluation to assess disease progress is indicated.
