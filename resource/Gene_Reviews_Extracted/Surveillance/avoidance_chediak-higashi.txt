No guidelines for surveillance of classic CHS exist. Current standard of care initiates evaluation for bone marrow transplantation as quickly as feasible after the diagnosis is confirmed.

For atypical or adolescent- or adult-onset CHS, annual screening should include the following:

Abdominal ultrasound examination to monitor for hepatosplenomegaly

CBC to evaluate for cytopenias

Evaluation for signs of liver dysfunction including hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypofibrinogenemia

Measurement of serum ferritin concentration

Soluble interleukin-2 receptor measurement

Consideration of bone marrow biopsy and/or lumbar puncture if history or physical examination suggests CNS involvement or other manifestations of the accelerated phase

If clinical status changes, the above tests should be repeated.

For both classic and atypical CHS, annual ophthalmologic examination is appropriate.
