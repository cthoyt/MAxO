Although no clinical guidelines are available, treating physicians should consider the following:

Beginning in infancy: periodic neurodevelopmental assessment and speech/language evaluation by a developmental pediatrician or pediatric neurologist

Soon after diagnosis is established:

Routine assessments of nutritional status, weight gain, and growth parameters

Routine pulmonary function tests, including assessment of blood gases, to monitor for respiratory insufficiency (alveolar hypoventilation and chronic hypercapnia)
