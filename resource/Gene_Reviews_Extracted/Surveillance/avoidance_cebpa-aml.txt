Affected individuals. Surveillance for CEBPA-associated familial AML is similar to that for other forms of AML. There are no generally accepted minimal residual disease (MRD) markers in CEBPA-associated AML or in most other AML subtypes with normal karyotypes.

Individuals are monitored and evaluated in accordance with administered treatment, clinical course, symptoms, and protocol, if enrolled in clinical trials. When complete remission is achieved and intensification therapy is complete, individuals are monitored with:

CBC and platelet counts every one to three months for two years with the frequency decreasing to every three to six months for up to five years;

Bone marrow aspiration when cytopenia and/or an abnormal peripheral blood smear are present.

Note: The use of flow cytometry for MRD monitoring is controversial.

Individuals with a germline CEBPA pathogenic variant who are cured of their initial disease episode may be at risk for new leukemic episodes, often occurring after a prolonged period of remission (>3 years post presentation) [Pabst et al 2009, Tawana et al 2015]. In light of these data, lifelong clinical surveillance is warranted to ensure prompt recognition and appropriate management of disease recurrence. Repeat testing of CEBPA at recurrence is important to help distinguish conventional relapse from new, independent leukemic episodes.

Asymptomatic carriers. Asymptomatic individuals with a pathogenic CEBPA germline variant may be reviewed with CBC profiling every six to 12 months. Bone marrow examination may be performed if there is an appropriate clinical indication (e.g., abnormalities in CBC). Referral for post-testing genetic counseling should be considered as appropriate.
