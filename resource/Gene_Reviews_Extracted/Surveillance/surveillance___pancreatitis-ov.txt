Surveillance for pancreatic cancer in high-risk groups with pancreatitis has been considered (see Definitions, Chronic pancreatitis for discussion of pancreatic cancer risk). However, because long-standing chronic pancreatitis results in pancreatic scarring and fibrosis that make assessment of abnormalities difficult [Ulrich 2001, Brand et al 2007], it is recommended that concerned individuals be referred to a surveillance program that includes biomarker research and other new techniques.
