No clinical guidelines specific to RRM2B-related mitochondrial disease are available; however, detailed evaluations are outlined in Wellcome Trust Centre for Mitochondrial Research Clinical Guidelines.

The following evaluations should be considered:

RRM2B-related mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (encephalo-myopathic form with renal tubulopathy)

Regular assessments of neurodevelopment, speech, and language

Regular evaluations by a pediatric neurologist to evaluate for the presence and/or severity of encephalopathy, with consideration of EEG and video EEG monitoring to determine presence of seizures and/or subclinical status epilepticus

Regular evaluation by a pediatric renal specialist, including assessment of renal function (electrolytes in blood and urine and urine analysis)

Routine assessment of nutritional status, growth, and body mass index (BMI)

Regular pulmonary function testing including monitoring of blood gases for early detection of respiratory compromise

RRM2B-related mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome and mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy

Biannual:

Comprehensive neurology consultation and clinical examination to include measures of functional neurologic status

Occupational therapy and physical therapy assessments

CBC, electrolytes, liver function (albumin, coagulation factors), liver enzymes (AST, ALT, GGT), blood glucose, and HBA1C

Annual pulmonary function testing including assessment of blood gases to monitor for early respiratory compromise

Routine assessment of nutritional status, weight gain, and BMI, including regular review with speech and language therapist with consideration of gastrostomy as needed for nutritional support

Imaging and diagnostic procedures including EEG, ECG, and brain MRI as indicated by clinical findings and rate of disease progression

RRM2B-related multiple mtDNA deletions with external ophthalmoplegia

Care will be directed by clinical findings. The following general evaluations are recommended:

Biannual:

Comprehensive neurology consultation and clinical examination to include measures of functional neurologic status

Occupational therapy and physical therapy assessments

CBC, electrolytes, liver function (albumin, coagulation factors), liver enzymes (AST, ALT, GGT), blood glucose, and HBA1C

Annual pulmonary function testing including assessment of blood gases to monitor for early respiratory compromise

Routine assessment of nutritional status, weight gain and BMI, biannually

Imaging and diagnostic procedures to include EEG, ECG, and MRI brain- as indicated by clinical findings and rate of disease progression

ECG advised biannually (KSS phenotype)
