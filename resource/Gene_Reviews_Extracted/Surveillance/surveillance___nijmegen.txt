Affected individuals

Periodic follow-up to monitor developmental progress, physical growth (including weight, length/height, and head circumference) and frequency of infections; monitoring for weight loss, which may signal the presence of a malignancy

Lifelong monitoring of immune biomarkers to include the parameters listed in Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

Careful follow up by oncologist: in individuals with NBS who are immunodeficient symptoms of lymphoid malignancies can be misleading.

Monitoring for pubertal progression in both females and males and for premature ovarian insufficiency in females [Chrzanowska et al 2010b]

Breast self-examination and ultrasonographic evaluation recommended in affected females

Carriers (heterozygotes)

Parents. As obligate carriers, parents should be monitored for malignancy, in particular breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men. No consensus tumor screening protocols for carriers have been published.

At-risk sibs. Evidence of cancer risk in young carriers is insufficient to warrant screening in childhood.
