Cardiac. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommendations for optimal cardiac care in persons with DMD or BMD [American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery 2005] (full text) and consensus guidelines published in 2010 [Bushby et al 2010b] (full text; purchase or institutional access required) include the following:

DMD

Complete cardiac evaluation at least every two years, beginning at the time of diagnosis or by the age of six until the age of ten years or at the onset of cardiac symptoms if they occur earlier

Note: At minimum, the evaluation should include an electrocardiogram and a noninvasive cardiac imaging study such as echocardiography or cardiac MRI.

At approximately age ten years, or at the onset of cardiac signs and symptoms, annual complete cardiac evaluation

Note: Most individuals with DMD demonstrating cardiac signs and symptoms are relatively late in their course.

If evaluation reveals ventricular dysfunction, the 2010 consensus guidelines recommend initiation of pharmacologic therapy and surveillance at least every six months

BMD. Complete cardiac evaluations beginning at approximately age ten years or at the onset of signs and symptoms. Evaluations should continue at least every two years.

The AAP recommendations for optimal cardiac care of female carriers for DMD or BMD [American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery 2005] include the following:

Education about the risk of developing cardiomyopathy and about the signs and symptoms of heart failure

Complete cardiac evaluation by a cardiac specialist with experience in the treatment of heart failure and/or neuromuscular disorders, with the initial evaluation to take place in late adolescence or early adulthood, or earlier at the appearance of cardiac signs and symptoms

Starting at age 25 to 30 years, screening with a complete cardiac evaluation at least every five years

Treatment of cardiac disease similar to that for boys with DMD or BMD

Pulmonary

Baseline pulmonary function testing before confinement to a wheelchair (usually age ~9-10 years)

Evaluation by a pediatric pulmonologist twice yearly after ANY of the following [Finder et al 2004]:

Confinement to a wheelchair

Reduction in vital capacity below 80% predicted

Age 12 years

The 2010 consensus guidelines [Bushby et al 2010b] (full text; purchase or institutional access required) make detailed recommendations regarding pulmonary care, including:

Use of self-inflating manual ventilation bag or mechanical insufflation-exsufflation device;

Manual and mechanically assisted cough techniques;

Indications for nocturnal and then daytime noninvasive ventilation as well as for tracheostomy.

Orthopedic

Monitoring for orthopedic complications, especially contractures and scoliosis in those with DMD and BMD

Evaluation for surgical interventions as needed
