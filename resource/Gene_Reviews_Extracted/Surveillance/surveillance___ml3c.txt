Young children with ML III gamma and their families usually benefit from out-patient clinic visits once a year, unless cardiac and/or respiratory monitoring need more frequent attention. Orthopedic assessment should be done at least once a year, with more frequent follow-up visits if any deterioration is observed. Annual ophthalmologic assessment should address possible ophthalmologic changes. If necessary, an ERG should be considered to better evaluate for retinal impairment.

During yearly visits, attention should be paid to pain relief, daily functional abilities, and psychological interventions.

Although cardiac manifestations are usually asymptomatic, monitoring for progressive valvular insufficiency using echocardiography should occur at least once a year.

Surveillance for metabolic bone disease includes DEXA scan in five-year intervals.
