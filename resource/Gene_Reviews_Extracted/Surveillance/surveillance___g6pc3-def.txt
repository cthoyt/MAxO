The following are appropriate:

Routine management of congenital heart disease, renal and urinary tract malformations

Routine management of hormone deficiencies

Consideration of oral steroids for inflammatory bowel disease [Desplantes et al 2014] or anti-TNF treatment [BÃ©gin et al 2013]. Some complications of IBD such as bowel stenosis may require appropriate surgical intervention.

Consideration of pancreatic enzyme supplementation if steatorrhea is present [Desplantes et al 2014]

Chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for acute myelogeneous leukemia

Frequent follow up by a hematologist or immunologist to monitor infection frequency and neutrophil counts to ensure an adequate response to G-CSF (i.e., absolute neutrophil counts above 0.5x109/L)

Monitoring of growth in children and pubertal development in adolescents

Biochemical profile including lipid profile

Monitoring for development of varicose veins, especially in adults

Monitoring for osteopenia/osteoporosis

If the G6PC3 pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

If the G6PC3 pathogenic variants in the family are not known, the following evaluations can be used to help clarify the disease status of at-risk sibs: full blood count, bone marrow examination (if persistent severe neutropenia is detected on full blood count), directed general examination for prominence of superficial veins, echocardiogram, and a renal and pelvic ultrasound examination.
