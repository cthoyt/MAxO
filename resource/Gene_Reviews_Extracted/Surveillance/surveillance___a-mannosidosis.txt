Suggested serial monitoring to evaluate severity and rate of disease progression

Medical history (every 6-12 months) including number and type of infections, hearing, weight loss, headache, fatigue, irritability, depression, change in social, domestic, school- or work-related activities, ability to walk distances; diarrhea, abdominal pain, muscle pain, joint aches or reduced range of movement, and bone pain

Physical examination (every 6-12 months) including otoscopy, ophthalmoscopy, assessment of liver and spleen size, heart and lungs, joint range of motion, gait, neurologic status, and orthopedic evaluation. In children, attention to growth (height, weight, and especially head circumference using standardized growth charts)

Examination by an otolaryngologist to detect impaired hearing and middle-ear infections

Audiometry. If intellectual disability makes cooperation difficult, brain stem evoked response testing

Ophthalmologic examination to detect corneal opacities, myopia, hyperopia, and strabismus

Neuropsychological testing to establish functional level and learning capacities

Blood tests. PLOT and C-reactive protein for evidence of inflammation, serum concentrations of ALT for evaluation of concomitant liver disease and creatinine for assessment of renal function. Immunologic status, focusing on SLE, is recommended.

Skeletal assessment. Plain radiographs of the head, knees (anterior-posterior view), spine (lateral view) and any symptomatic sites

Bone densitometry every two to five years to assess osteopenia

CT scan of the brain to evaluate the size of the ventricles and shape and size of the cerebellum if signs and symptoms of hydrocephalus are present (e.g., headache, increasing gait ataxia, nausea, papilledema)
