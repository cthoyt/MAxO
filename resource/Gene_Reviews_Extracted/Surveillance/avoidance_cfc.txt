If anomalies are identified in any organ system, lifelong periodic follow up is warranted. Consensus guidelines for surveillance in CFC syndrome have been established [Pierpont et al 2014].

Gastrointestinal. Monitor for signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal reflux, constipation, and generalized dysmotility.

Endocrine. Monitor growth parameters to identify evidence of growth failure that may be associated with growth hormone deficiency. Monitor for signs of precocious puberty.

Cognitive development. Assess periodically to be certain that school programs or other supports are addressing learning needs.

Neurologic. Monitor neurologic signs and symptoms with period neurologic evaluations and MRI if indicated. Chiari malformation and later onset of seizures have been observed.

Audiologic. Annual evaluation of hearing is recommended.

Ophthalmologic. Periodic evaluation by an ophthalmologist to monitor for ocular issues (such as myopia, hyperopia, cataracts) is recommended.

Cardiac. If the initial cardiac evaluation is normal, periodic follow-up evaluations including an echocardiogram and an electrocardiogram are necessary as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and rhythm disturbances may develop later in life.

Dermatologic. As affected individuals age, formation of nevi may be progressive. At present, the natural history of the nevi is unknown. Periodic and routine dermatologic evaluation of nevi may be warranted to monitor for malignant change, although no individuals with CFC syndrome have been reported to have a malignant change.

Musculoskeletal. Periodic evaluation for scoliosis during young childhood is recommended.

Malignancy. No screening protocol exists at present, as it is unclear if individuals with CFC syndrome are at an increased risk for malignancies.
