Appropriate surveillance includes:

Daily evaluation by parents and caregivers for early signs of otherwise unrecognized injury;

Regular examinations by specialists in pediatrics, orthopedics, dentistry, ophthalmology, and dermatology to identify serious injuries and initiate early treatment;

Annual follow up at a center that fosters comprehensive care and communication between the various subspecialties that are needed for optimal care.
