The following should be monitored periodically to assess the adequacy of treatment, and more frequently following initial diagnosis when treatment is being optimized:

Complete blood count

Serum and CSF folate concentrations. In particular, monitoring the trough CSF folate concentration is critical to assure that the dose of folate is sufficient to achieve CSF folate concentrations as close as possible to what is normal for the affected individualâ€™s age.

Neurologic/cognitive status to ensure that CSF folate levels are adequate

Serum and CSF homocysteine concentrations. A high homocysteine concentration is the most sensitive indicator of folate deficiency.

Serum immunoglobulin concentrations until they are within the normal range and the hemoglobin and serum folate levels are normal and stable
