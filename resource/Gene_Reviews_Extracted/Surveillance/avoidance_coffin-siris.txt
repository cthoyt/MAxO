Surveillance includes the following:

Yearly evaluation by a developmental pediatrician to assess developmental progress and therapeutic and educational interventions

Annual follow up with a gastroenterologist and feeding specialists as needed to monitor feeding and weight gain

Regular follow up of ophthalmologic and/or audiologic abnormalities

Because of the rarity of tumors in CSS, the utility of tumor surveillance has not been determined.
