Children of both sexes with findings suggestive of IGD (e.g., microphallus, anosmia) should be monitored at regular intervals from age 11 years onwards with the following:

Assessment of sexual maturation by Tanner staging (Table 1)

Measurement of serum concentrations of LH, FSH, and total testosterone (T) in males and estradiol (E2) in females

Bone age determinations

In individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of IGD, serum sex steroid levels (to guide optimal hormone replacement) and bone mineral density should be monitored at regular intervals.
