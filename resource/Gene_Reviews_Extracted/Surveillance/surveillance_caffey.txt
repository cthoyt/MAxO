Currently, no standard surveillance protocols exist. However, given that Caffey disease is a collagenopathy, yearly evaluation of stature, joint extensibility, hernias, fracture history, and dental health is recommended.

Although no systematic reviews of bone mineral density in adults with the defining pathogenic variant have been performed, reports of fractures and short stature in adults with other COL1A1 pathogenic variants suggest that assessment of bone mineral density may be prudent in adults with a history of Caffey disease in childhood.
