Children with CCD should be monitored for the following:

Orthopedic complications

Dental abnormalities

Upper-airway obstruction. Because of the craniofacial involvement, signs and symptoms of obstructive upper-airway disease should be elicited. When symptoms are suggestive, a sleep study is indicated and surgical intervention may be required.

Sinus and ear infections

Hearing loss. Regular audiometry in individuals with repeated ear infections allows the identification and early management of hearing loss if it develops.

Osteoporosis. DEXA to measure bone mineral density should be done early in adolescence and every five to ten years thereafter. If there are clinical signs of osteopenia (increased number of fractures), evaluation and treatment should be started earlier.
