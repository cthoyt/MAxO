After initiating corticosteroids, affected individuals should be followed monthly, with efforts to taper the steroids to the lowest tolerated dose. Blood pressure should be monitored at each visit, as hypertension can develop following the initiation of steroid therapy.

When a maintenance steroid dose is achieved, ongoing evaluations should include the following:

Annual:

Complete neurologic examination

CBC

Measurement of blood pressure

Hearing screen

Evaluation of bone mineral densityNote: CED does not appear to cause an increase in spine density; therefore steroid therapy could lead to osteoporosis of the spine [Author, personal observation].

Routine monitoring of linear growth in children due to the possible side effect of delayed or stunted growth

The authors are aware of one affected teenage individual who died of a dilated ascending aorta dissection. Whether this is related to CED is unknown. Because the mechanism of CED involves increased TGFB1 signaling, also found in Marfan syndrome and Loeys-Dietz syndrome, this death is of some concern. The authors are unaware of any other similar cases. Note: No recommendations for routine evaluation of the aorta can be made at this time.
