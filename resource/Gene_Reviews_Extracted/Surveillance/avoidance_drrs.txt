In those with cardiac malformations or conduction defects:

ECG is indicated annually or more often in individuals diagnosed with a conduction defect, as well as in individuals at risk for developing a conduction defect.

ECG should be combined with annual Holter monitor in individuals with known conduction disease to assess progression.

Depending on the nature and significance of a known cardiac malformation, echocardiogram surveillance may be requested every one to five years by the managing cardiologist.

In those with renal anomalies:

Renal function should be monitored by routine laboratory parameters for renal function (ie, serum creatinine), even if no impairment of renal function is detected on initial examination. In the first years of life, renal function should be performed every six months or once per year. If renal function remains normal, the screening intervals may be extended.

Renal ultrasound should be repeated if renal position anomalies could cause obstruction. The frequency depends on the clinical situation.

In those affected individuals with thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis, blood counts should be monitored at least yearly. However, data are sparse on the natural history of thrombocytopenia in individuals with SALL4 pathogenic variants and so it is unknown at present if more severe complications may occur.
