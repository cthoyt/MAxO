Eyes. Annual ophthalmologic examination, including assessment of refractive error, is indicated.

Skin. Over many years, exposure to the sun of lightly pigmented skin can result in coarse, rough, thickened skin (pachydermia), solar keratoses (premalignant lesions), and skin cancer. Both basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma can develop. Although skin melanocytes are present in individuals with HPS, melanoma is rare. Examination for these findings should be performed at least annually.

Pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary function testing should be performed annually in adults.

Colitis. Colitis is suspected in those with a history of cramping, increased mucus in the stool, and rectal bleeding; colonoscopy is used to confirm the diagnosis.
