Consider periodic evaluation by a clinical geneticist to discuss manifestations associated with disorders of the Ras/MAPK pathway that may eventually be associated with Legius syndrome

However, given the prevalence of vascular abnormalities and hypertension in NF1, it would seem appropriate to have regular blood pressure monitoring at each physician visit.
