Asymptomatic children at risk. Large-scale, population-based studies in Japan, Europe, Canada, and the US that screened healthy infants with urinary catecholamines to identify neuroblastomas found no improvement in survival in children diagnosed before symptoms occurred [Schilling et al 2002, Woods et al 2002].

Because no data are available as yet on the effect of screening in families with a germline ALK activating pathogenic variant and because tumor surveillance at the population level does not improve neuroblastoma outcome, there is currently no consensus on the proper frequency or type of tumor surveillance for individuals with a germline ALK activating pathogenic variant. In the absence of published guidelines, the noninvasive measures of physical examination, abdominal ultrasound examination, and measurement of urine catecholamine metabolite levels have been performed on the following schedule; less frequent intervals may also be appropriate.

Every 1-2 months in infants age ≤12 months

Every 3-4 months in children age ≤10 years

After successful treatment of a neuroblastic tumor, screening for neuroblastic tumors should continue since children with ALK-related neuroblastic tumor susceptibility are at risk of developing multiple primary tumors. Although no consensus exists, some recommend screening until age six years [Bourdeaut et al 2012].
