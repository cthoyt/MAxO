Given the limited number of individuals reported with MPPH syndrome, no formal surveillance guidelines exist; however, recommended surveillance includes the following:

Follow-up with a pediatric neurologist, at least every six months until age six years, and annually thereafter.

Brain MRI to detect hydrocephalus and/or cerebellar tonsillar ectopia; provisionally recommended every six months from birth to age two years, and annually from age two to six years. In older individuals, the frequency should be based on prior results and clinical findings, with particular attention to apnea or other abnormal patterns of respiration, headaches, changes in gait, or other neurologic problems.

Long-term neurologic follow up is recommended for management of epilepsy.

Routine follow up with a developmental pediatrician is appropriate, given the high risk for developmental delays and/or intellectual disability.
