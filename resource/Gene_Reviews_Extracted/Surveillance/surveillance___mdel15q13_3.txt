Close assessment/monitoring of neurocognitive development and developmental milestones are recommended during childhood for all children who have the 15q13.3 microdeletion, with referral to early intervention programs if required.

Medical surveillance for persons with cardiac defects, epilepsy, autism spectrum disorders, and schizophrenia should follow standard practice for these disorders, considering the age of the patient and the specific manifestations.
