Lifelong clinical follow up should include the following:

Neurologic

Monitoring of antiepileptic drug treatment (drug levels and clinical assessment of biological effects);

Periodic assessment of hearing by audiograms and BAEPs and of the peripheral nerves by NCV and needle EMG.

Renal function monitoring by measurement of: blood pressure; body weight; serum concentrations of creatinine, albumin, and cholesterol; 24-hour urinary protein; and creatinine clearance

Agents/Circumstances to avoid

Diphenylhydantoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and possibly lamotrigine increase myoclonus and should be avoided in any individual with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME), including AMRF.

Evaluation of relatives at risk

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Some antiepileptic drugs can lead to an increased risk of malformations, growth retardation, or neurodevelopmental disabilities in exposed fetuses. However, when pregnant women experience prolonged seizures during pregnancy, the risk of adverse fetal outcomes is increased. Therefore, it is recommended that women with a known seizure disorder continue to take antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. Standard measures for prevention of fetopathy should be followed. These include:

Possible changes of medication prior to pregnancy;

Spacing of the antiepileptic drugs into four doses a day or taking extended release medications, so that the drug levels do not have significant peaks or troughs;

Monitoring the dosages and drug levels of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy and after the delivery.

In addition, folic acid should be prescribed at 1 mg/day for all women of childbearing age and increased to 5 mg/day when planning a pregnancy (ideally 3 months prior to conception) and during the pregnancy, in order to prevent possible neural tube defects and other congenital malformations that can be associated with fetal exposure to antiepileptic drugs.
