The following evaluations are performed at different intervals depending on age and disease severity.

During the first year of life, infants may need to be evaluated once or twice a month by a metabolic specialist.

Clinical evaluation should include assessment of:

Growth including weight, linear growth, and head circumference;

Nutritional status;

Feeding ability;

Developmental and neurocognitive progress, as age-appropriate.

Laboratory evaluation should include:

Metabolic studies: urine organic acids, plasma MMA concentration, plasma amino acids (methionine), plasma tHcy concentration;

Complete blood count (CBC) to monitor for cytopenias;

Nutritional studies, if indicated: electrolytes, albumin, prealbumin, plasma amino acids, vitamin levels (including thiamine and 25-hydroxyvitamin D), and trace minerals.

Routine evaluations should include:

Ophthalmologic evaluation for retinal and optic nerve changes in patients with cblC and cblG and if visual symptoms are present;

Neurologic evaluations for early signs of psychomotor retardation, behavioral disturbances, seizures, and myelopathy;

Brain MRI and/or EEG as clinically indicated.
