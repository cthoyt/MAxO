Patients with severe AATD should undergo pulmonary function tests (including spirometry with bronchodilators and diffusing capacity measurements) every six to 12 months [American Thoracic Society & European Respiratory Society 2003].

All individuals with the PI*ZZ genotype (including those who did not manifest liver disease in childhood) should undergo periodic evaluation of liver function [American Thoracic Society & European Respiratory Society 2003].

While current guidelines from the American Thoracic Society recommend regular follow up of liver function tests in adults with AATD [American Thoracic Society & European Respiratory Society 2003], those tests may not reliably detect liver disease in these individuals [Clark et al 2012]. For instance, various liver function tests were not significantly different in persons with AATD with or without liver disease, and the sensitivity of the alanine transaminase (ALT) for alpha-1 antitrypsin-associated liver disease was only 12% [Clark et al 2012]

A combination of liver function tests, platelet count, and liver ultrasound examination may be an effective screening method to detect the presence of severe fibrosis or cirrhosis [Dawwas et al 2013].

All patients with established liver disease should have periodic (i.e., every 6-12 months) ultrasound examination of the liver to monitor for fibrotic changes and HCC [American Thoracic Society & European Respiratory Society 2003, Nelson et al 2012].
