For individuals with HCM who do not currently meet criteria for placement of an ICD for primary prevention, risk for SCD should be reassessed approximately every 12-24 months (or sooner if any clinical parameters change) [Gersh et al 2011].

For relatives at risk for HCM. Screening guidelines for HCM have been proposed for the longitudinal evaluation of clinically unaffected at-risk family members (see Table 2). Note that the following screening guidelines apply both to relatives in whom a pathogenic variant has been identified and to asymptomatic first-degree relatives (adults and children) of an individual with primary HCM in whom a pathogenic variant has not been identified.

Because penetrance of diagnostic features (i.e., LVH) is age dependent, a single unremarkable evaluation does not exclude the possibility of future development of HCM. Diagnostic clinical manifestations are often not present in infancy/early childhood; they commonly develop during adolescence and early adulthood, but may also develop late in life. Therefore, longitudinal follow up is required at a frequency based on the individual’s age and family history, and physician discretion. Screening should be performed in response to any symptoms that develop or any change in clinical status.

Screening Guideline

<12 yrs

Optional unless any of the following are present:

Family history of early HCM-related death, early development of LVH, or other adverse complicationsCompetitive athlete in intense training programSymptomsOther clinical findings that suggest early LVH

12-18 yrs

Repeat evaluation every 12-18 months

>18-21 yrs

Repeat evaluation every ≤5 years or in response to any change in symptomsMore frequent evaluation if the family has late-onset LVH or HCM-related complications
