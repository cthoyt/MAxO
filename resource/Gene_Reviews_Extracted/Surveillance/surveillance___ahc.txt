If puberty has not started by age 14 years, serum concentrations of LH and FSH (basal concentration and GnRH-stimulated concentration), testosterone, and inhibin B are monitored to evaluate for the possibility of HH.

Some children and parents prefer the induction of puberty at the same time as the affected boyâ€™s peer-group; this should not be delayed unnecessarily.

If puberty does start spontaneously it is likely to arrest; thus, careful monitoring of testosterone levels is needed.

Psychological counseling should be available for families and young people if needed to discuss the issues related to hormone replacement therapy and future fertility.
