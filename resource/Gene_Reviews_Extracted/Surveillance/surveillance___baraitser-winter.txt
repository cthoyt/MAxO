Appropriate surveillance includes the following:

Neurodevelopmental follow up by a multidisciplinary team involved in cognitive impairment and appropriate support

Coloboma or microphthalmia: ophthalmologic follow-up (at least yearly) with systematic screening for intraocular hypertension and glaucoma. Although glaucoma has not been reported to date, it is a known complication of colobomatous microphthalmia. Early detection allows specific treatment of intraocular hypertension.

Routine follow up of deafness for any evidence of progression

Cardiac defect: cardiology follow up (adapted to the type of congenital heart disease identified)

Renal tract anomaly: nephrology follow up adapted to the anomaly and the risk of renal insufficiency

Screening for malignancies. The risk of malignancies is not established for BWCFF syndrome; screening for hematologic malignancies must be considered in case of physical deterioration or unexplained chronic fever.
