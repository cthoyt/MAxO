Height and weight should be monitored on a regular basis with consideration of Barth syndrome-specific growth patterns [Roberts et al 2012].

Standardized cardiac evaluation including echocardiogram, ECG, and Holter monitoring should be considered at least yearly [Spencer et al 2005].

A low threshold for performing an electrophysiologic study to assess for a potentially serious arrhythmia is appropriate, especially in the presence of symptoms such as palpitations and syncope, abnormal arrhythmia screening tests, or a family history of sudden death [Spencer et al 2005].
