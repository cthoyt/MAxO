According to current guidelines (AASLD [Roberts & Schilsky 2008] and EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines [European Association for Study of Liver 2012]), routine monitoring should include the following examinations:

At least twice annually: serum copper and ceruloplasmin, liver biochemistries, international normalized ratio, complete blood count, urinalysis, and physical examination including neurologic assessment

Note: Patients receiving chelation therapy require a complete blood count and urinalysis regularly, no matter how long they have been on treatment

At least once annually: 24-hour urinary excretion of copper

Note: Measurements are recommended more frequently if there are questions on compliance or if dosage of medications is adjusted.
