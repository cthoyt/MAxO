Regular evaluation by a general pediatrician is recommended for younger children, individuals with many medical complications needing coordination of medical specialists, and families requiring more support than average [Tatton-Brown & Rahman 2007].

The clinician may wish to evaluate older children/teenagers and those individuals without many medical complications less frequently.

The following are appropriate at the clinical evaluation:

Thorough history to identify known clinical sequelae of Sotos syndrome

Cardiac auscultation

Blood pressure measurement

Examination for curvature of the spine

Urine dipstick to assess for quiescent urine infection

Referral to an ophthalmologist if strabismus or other problem with vision is suspected

Referral for audiologic assessment if hearing is a concern or if the child has had many upper respiratory tract infections

Referral to the appropriate clinical specialist if problems are identified

Note: Cancer screening is not recommended. (1) The absolute risk of sacrococcygeal teratoma and neuroblastoma is low (~1%) [Tatton-Brown et al 2005b, Tatton-Brown & Rahman 2007]. This level of risk does not warrant routine screening, particularly as screening for neuroblastoma has not been shown to decrease mortality and can lead to false positive results [Schilling et al 2002]. (2) Wilms tumor risk is not significantly increased and routine renal ultrasound examination is not indicated [Scott et al 2006].
