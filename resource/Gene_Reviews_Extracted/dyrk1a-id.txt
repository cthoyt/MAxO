Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

To establish the extent of the disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with DYRK1A-related intellectual disability syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended: Multidisciplinary developmental evaluation including speech/language evaluation focused on nonverbal language ability and related educational and teaching strategies Sleep history and sleep evaluation if necessary Feeding assessment in infants and young children to detect gastroesophageal reflux or suck/swallowing problems Neurologic evaluation including brain imaging studies and EEG in individuals with microcephaly and/or seizures Musculoskeletal examination for signs of hypertonia and spine curvature anomalies; orthopedic referral if needed Physical therapy evaluation regarding interventions needed to achieve optimal ambulation The following baseline evaluations: Endocrine Dental Cardiac (for possible heart anomalies including valve, aorta and septal defects) Ophthalmology Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Treatment of Manifestations

Treatment includes the following: Ongoing routine medical care by a pediatrician or other primary care physician Educational programs to address the specific needs identified; speech therapy directed at improving communication skills; introduction of sign language and augmentative communication aids such as picture cards, communication boards and/or computer touch screens as early as possible Therapeutic management of sleep disturbances if necessary Early intervention with occupational therapy for feeding problems; consideration of tube feeding for severe persisting feeding problems Epilepsy treatment in accordance with standard practice under care of a neurologist Early intervention with physical therapy for hypertonic musculature and gait disturbances. A wheeled walker may be useful for children with serious gait disturbances. Standard treatment for orthopedic, endocrine, dental, cardiac, ophthalmologic, and other medical issues

Surveillance

The following are appropriate: Monitoring and guidance as needed for educational and behavior problems Regular lifelong dietary evaluation to assure optimal nutritional status Monitoring for complications of hypertonic musculature such as scoliosis and the development of a stiff gait Regular lifelong evaluations of the following: Teeth: frequency determined by a dentist, based on the dental condition Heart: based on the type of congenital anomaly. If no congenital cardiac anomaly is present, ongoing cardiac surveillance is not needed. Eyes
