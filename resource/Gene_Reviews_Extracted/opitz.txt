Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with X-linked Opitz G/BBB syndrome, the following evaluations by a multidisciplinary team (including craniofacial surgeon, ophthalmologist, pediatrician, pediatric urologist, cardiologist, pulmonologist, speech pathologist, and clinical geneticist) are recommended: Past medical history and physical examination with attention to head and facial measurements, palate, heart, genitourinary system, and lower respiratory system Complete eye evaluation including assessment of visual acuity, refractive error, and ocular alignment for possible strabismus Assessment of hypospadias by a urologist, including ultrasound examination to evaluate for renal/urinary tract abnormalities in males with severe hypospadias Laryngoscopy and chest x-ray in individuals who have choking with feeding, recurrent pneumonia, and/or aspiration Assessment of cleft lip/palate (CLP) by a craniofacial surgeon Age-appropriate assessment of development and intellectual abilities Assessment of anal position and patency Echocardiogram Cranial imaging

Treatment of Manifestations

 Management of anomalies by a multidisciplinary team (including craniofacial surgeon, ophthalmologist, pediatrician, pediatric urologist, cardiologist, pulmonologist, speech pathologist, and clinical geneticist) to help assure coordination of care is indicated. Treatment as needed by an ophthalmologist Surgical intervention as needed for hypospadias Surgical treatment of medically significant laryngotracheoesophageal (LTE) abnormalities; often tracheostomy is necessary initially to assure an adequate airway. Surgical management for cleft lip/palate and other craniofacial anomalies; therapy for speech problems secondary to the cleft lip and palate Neuropsychological support; many males with X-linked Opitz G/BBB syndrome require special educational programs. Surgical intervention for imperforate anus Surgical repair as needed for heart defects

Prevention of Primary Manifestations

 All primary manifestations are present at birth. To date no factors that can influence their expression have been identified.

Prevention of Secondary Complications

 Antireflux pharmacologic therapy minimizes the risk for aspiration until laryngeal competence is assured.

Surveillance

 Regular follow-up depending on the type of malformations present: Craniofacial team follow-up for those with cleft lip/palate, including regular monitoring of hearing Urology follow-up for those with significant hypospadias and/or renal defects Cardiac follow-up for those with cardiac defects Gastroenterology, pulmonary, and/or surgical follow-up for those with LTE defects Gastroenterology and/or surgical follow-up for those with anal defects
