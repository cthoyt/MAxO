Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 After the diagnosis of dense deposit disease/membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II (DDD/MPGNII) has been made, the following evaluations are recommended: Evaluate the complement system by measuring serum concentration of CH50, APH50, C3, C3d, C4, factor H and sMAC. (For a list of laboratories providing these tests, contact Richard Smith. See Author Notes.) Complement protein measures in DDD/MPGNII are distinctive, with most patients having only low serum concentrations of C3, while serum concentrations of properdin, C5, and other terminal proteins are within the normal range. Factor H serum concentrations can be low, as has been reported with pathogenic missense variants in the CFH coding sequence that block protein secretion from the endoplasmic reticulum [Ault et al 1997, Dragon-Durey et al 2004]. Measure autoantibodies including C3NeF, factor H autoantibodies (FHAA) and factor B autoantibodies (FBAA). Screen CFH for pathogenic variants using bidirectional sequencing. Establish the extent of renal disease by measuring serum creatinine concentration, and monitor creatinine clearance, proteinuria and hematuria. Obtain a baseline ophthalmologic examination [McAvoy et al 2004].

Treatment of Manifestations

 Nonspecific therapies have been shown to be effective in numerous chronic glomerular diseases and should be initiated. The judicious use of these agents, along with optimal blood pressure control, may be of benefit in individuals with DDD/MPGNII. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers decrease proteinuria in many glomerular diseases and slow the progression to renal failure [Ruggenenti et al 1999, Brenner et al 2001]. A retrospective study found that the combination of angiotensin blockers and immunosuppressants (steroids) is more effective than each therapy alone in preventing the development of renal failure [Nasr et al 2009]. Lipid-lowering agents, and in particular hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, may delay progression of renal disease as well as correct endothelial cell dysfunction and alter long-term atherosclerotic risks in the presence of hyperlipidemia [Nickolas et al 2003, Maisch & Pezzillo 2004]. These agents are not widely used in children. Renal allografts. Fewer than 200 individuals with DDD/MPGNII have undergone transplantation [Braun et al 2005]. Five-year allograft survival approximates 50%, which is significantly worse than for the NAPRTCS database as a whole (p=0.001). Living-related donor grafts fare better than deceased donor grafts (p<0.005). Allograft survival appears to be age-dependent in DDD; the survival of pediatric DDD transplant recipients is significantly worse than the rest of the pediatric transplant population [Angelo et al 2011]. DDD/MPGNII recurs in nearly all grafts and is the predominant cause of graft failure in 15%-50% of transplant recipients [Appel et al 2005, Angelo et al 2011]. There are little data to suggest that any therapeutic interventions have an effect on reversing this course, although isolated reports have described the use of plasmapheresis, which appears to be of equivocal benefit [FrÃ©meaux-Bacchi et al 1994, Kurtz & Schlueter 2002].

Prevention of Primary Manifestations

 Although most treatment for DDD/MPGNII is ineffective, plasma replacement therapy in patients with pathogenic variants in CFH can control complement activation and prevent ESRD [Licht et al 2006].

Surveillance

 Periodic funduscopic assessment is appropriate [McAvoy et al 2004].

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 If pathogenic variants in CFH have been identified in an affected individual, sibs can be offered molecular genetic testing to identify those who have the same variant(s) in order to facilitate early diagnosis and management of renal disease. Penetrance rates, however, are not known. See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Therapies Under Investigation

 A clinical study using eculizumab in persons with DDD/MPGN2 or C3 glomerulonephritis who are age 18 years and older is ongoing but is not recruiting new patients (ClinicalTrials.gov). A clinical study using sulodexide in persons with DDD/MPGNII who are under age 21 years was put on inactive status as no beneficial effect was noted in patients with diabetic nephropathy (ClinicalTrials.gov). Search ClinicalTrials.gov for access to information on clinical studies for a wide range of diseases and conditions.

Other

 The impact of genotype on graft survival has not yet been explored. Experience with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and B cell suppression is limited. The following treatment modalities are of unproven value: Plasmapheresis to remove or suppress serum C3NeF activity: In one study, one of three adults with DDD/MPGNII experienced improvement in serum creatinine during plasmapheresis [McGinley et al 1985]. Another study reported success using plasmapheresis to treat a five-year-old boy with recurrent DDD/MPGNII after transplantation. Twelve phereses were performed over 24 days, and the child continued to have improved renal function one year later [Oberkircher et al 1988]. In another report, a 15-year-old girl with rapidly progressive recurrent DDD/MPGNII in her allograft underwent 73 phereses over 63 weeks, stabilizing her creatinine and improving her creatinine clearance. Serial biopsies during this time demonstrated persistent DDD/MPGNII without development of tubular atrophy. During the course of therapy, serum C3NeF activity decreased and C3NeF activity was detected in the removed plasma. Because of the morbidity associated with repeated phereses, treatment was discontinued and graft failure ensued [Kurtz & Schlueter 2002]. In another report, two patients with a pathogenic variant in CFH were successfully treated with fresh frozen plasma [Licht et al 2006]. Prednisone. Although long-term controlled studies of prednisone therapy have suggested a possible benefit as measured by a decrease in proteinuria and prolonged renal survival in children with MPGN type I-III [West 1986, McEnery 1990], a randomized placebo-controlled study found that while evidence showed an overall benefit in individuals with MPGNI, II, and III combined, children with DDD/MPGNII had no better response to prednisone than to lactose, with treatment failure defined as a creatinine greater than 350 mmol/L (4 mg/dL) in 55.6% (5/9) and 60% (3/5) of individuals, respectively [Tarshish et al 1992]. Available data on steroid therapy in adults with DDD/MPGNII suggest a similar lack of efficacy [Donadio & Offord 1989]. Note: The use of steroid therapy is extremely effective in JANG, which can be confused with DDD/MPGNII. The two diseases can be distinguished clinically, as DDD/MPGNII is typically associated with C3NeF-induced hypocomplementemia, often with nephrotic syndrome and hypertension, while in JANG, C3 levels remain at the lower limit of normal [West et al 2000]. Calcineurin inhibitors. When evaluated in small numbers of individuals, the calcineurin inhibitors do not improve renal survival in DDD/MPGNII. Furthermore, in vitro studies with two calcineurin inhibitors, cyclosporin and tacrolimus, have shown that at therapeutic concentrations neither drug suppresses C3 transcription [Sacks & Zhou 2003]. Given the evidence that uncontrolled activation of the AP of the complement cascade is the basis of MPGNII/DDD, it is not surprising that these drugs are clinically ineffective immunomodulatory treatment modalities. Combined therapy with immunosuppression (IS) and renin aingotensin system (RAS) blockade. In a retrospective study, the combined use of IS (steroids) and RAS blockade (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and/or angiotensin II receptor blocker) was protective against developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The IS/RAS blockade therapy was superior to the use of either agent alone. These findings need to be confirmed by a prospective control study [Nasr et al 2009]. Bevacizumab. In one study, a 29-year-old woman with DDD/MPGNII and subretinal neovascular membranes was treated with monthly intravitreal injections of bevacizumab. An improvement in vision was noted; renal function remained unaltered [Farah et al 2009].
