Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with KAT6B-related disorders, the following are recommended: 
            GPS and SBBYSS Clinical genetics consultation Evaluation by developmental specialist Feeding evaluation Baseline hearing evaluation Thyroid function tests 
            GPS Evaluation of males for cryptorchidism Orthopedic evaluation if contractures are present or feet/ankles are malpositioned Hip radiographs to evaluate for femoral head dislocation Renal ultrasound examination for hydronephrosis and cysts Echocardiogram for congenital heart defects Evaluation for laryngomalacia if respiratory issues are present Evaluation by gastroenterologist as needed, particularly if bowel malrotation is suspected 
            SBBYSS Ophthalmologic evaluation for lacrimal duct abnormalities, amblyopia, and other issues

Treatment of Manifestations

 The following are appropriate: Developmental. Educational intervention and speech therapy beginning in infancy because of the high risk for motor, cognitive, speech, and language delay 
                Skeletal features Referral to an orthopedist for consideration of surgical release of contractures Early referral to physical therapy to help increase joint mobility Genital anomalies. Orchiopexy in males with undescended testes Anal anomalies. Surgery as required Renal anomalies. Referral to an urologist or nephrologist as indicated Heart defects. Routine management Facial features. In SBBYSS, ptosis surgery and cleft palate repair if present 
                Other features Hearing aids as needed for hearing loss Thyroid hormone replacement as needed Intervention for respiratory and feeding issues as needed in the neonatal period Referral to a gastroenterologist for evaluation and treatment of feeding difficulties and bowel malrotation

Surveillance

 The following should be assessed annually: Developmental progress Ophthalmologic conditions such as amblyopia (which develops in a majority of patients with SBBYSS) Thyroid function Cardiac function if malformations are present Renal function if hydronephrosis or multiple renal cysts are present Contractures and/or scoliosis

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
