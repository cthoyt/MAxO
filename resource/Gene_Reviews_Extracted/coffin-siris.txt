Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with Coffin-Siris syndrome (CSS), the following evaluations are recommended: Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor Neurologic and/or developmental examination to record developmental milestones and identify neurologic symptoms or deficits Evaluation for occupational, speech, or physical therapy as needed Gastrointestinal evaluation for feeding difficulties or poor growth Dietary evaluation by a nutritionist as needed Ophthalmologic examination, including a dilated fundus examination and visual acuity Audiology evaluation with auditory brain stem response testing and otoacoustic emission testing to assess for hearing loss Echocardiogram to evaluate for structural cardiac defects Renal ultrasonography to evaluate for structural kidney or genitourinary (GU) anomalies

Treatment of Manifestations

 The following are appropriate: Occupational, physical, and/or speech therapies to optimize developmental outcomes Feeding therapy, nutritional supplementation, and/or gastrostomy tube placement as needed to meet nutritional needs Spectacles as needed to correct refractive errors and surgery as needed for strabismus and/or ptosis Hearing aids as needed

Prevention of Secondary Complications

 Therapies and interventions which can prevent secondary complications mirror the recommended treatments for an individualâ€™s particular needs. This may include developmental therapies, appropriate cardiac, gastrointestinal, and neurologic evaluations and treatments, and ophthalmologic and audiologic surveillance.

Surveillance

 Surveillance includes the following: Yearly evaluation by a developmental pediatrician to assess developmental progress and therapeutic and educational interventions Annual follow up with a gastroenterologist and feeding specialists as needed to monitor feeding and weight gain Regular follow up of ophthalmologic and/or audiologic abnormalities Because of the rarity of tumors in CSS, the utility of tumor surveillance has not been determined.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

 As no females with CSS have been reported to reproduce, potential complications of pregnancy are unknown.
