Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with a free sialic acid storage disorder, the following evaluations are recommended: Neurologic and developmental evaluations to establish a baseline for educational and rehabilitation interventions MRINote: MRI may reveal classic brain findings, but correlations between such findings and disease severity have not been established. Biochemical genetics or neurogenetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations

The medical and psychosocial management of individuals with free sialic acid storage disorders is symptomatic and supportive. Management focuses on rehabilitation to optimize mobility and communication. Programs to foster normal development and assure adequate nutrition should be implemented. Treatment of seizures follows standard management principles.

Surveillance

Regular evaluation by a rehabilitation specialist may identify potentially helpful interventions.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

No routine testing is recommended because adult presentations are unusual and no early interventions are available. See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Therapies Under Investigation

Search ClinicalTrials.gov for access to information on clinical studies for a wide range of diseases and conditions. Note: There may not be clinical trials for this disorder.
