Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), the following evaluations are recommended: Neurologic evaluation, including EEG and brain MRI Developmental assessment including assessment of motor skills, cognition, and speech Physical therapy evaluation of joint range of motion Ophthalmologic evaluation Feeding and swallowing assessment in individuals with lack of head control or lack of the ability to sit without support Assessment of caloric intake and nutritional status Clinical genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations

 There is no definite treatment for FCMD. Multidisciplinary and appropriate management can prolong survival and improve the quality of life for individuals with FCMD. Treatment includes the following: Physical therapy and stretching exercises to promote mobility and prevent contractures Monitoring for orthopedic complications such as foot deformity and scoliosis. When scoliosis is present, spinal fusion can preserve breathing function and improve sitting balance [Takaso et al 2010] Use of mechanical assistance such as long leg braces to maintain standing posture and wheelchairs to help mobility Use of respiratory aids such as nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilator when indicated Note: Noninvasive ventilation is offered, particularly at night, before respiratory distress becomes acute. Prompt treatment of acute respiratory tract infections; particularly important, as these infections are the most common cause of hospital admissions and death in people with FCMD Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) when indicated Surgical treatment for gastroesophageal reflux when indicated Gastrostomy when indicated to assure adequate caloric intake Routine therapy of cardiomyopathy

Surveillance

 Surveillance includes: Monitoring of respiratory function in individuals with advanced FCMD over age ten years. Those who survive beyond age 20 years may require tracheostomy or noninvasive respiratory support. Monitoring of myocardial involvement by chest x-ray, ECG, and echocardiography in individuals over age ten years. Observation/evaluation of gastrointestinal function by a qualified specialist, using a video-fluoroscopic swallow assessment, upper gastrointestinal tract image and pH monitor for gastroesophageal reflux Monitoring for foot deformities and scoliosis

Therapies Under Investigation

 Taniguchi-Ikeda et al [2011] reported that introduction of antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) targeting the splice acceptor, the predicted exonic splicing enhancer, and the intronic splicing enhancer prevented pathogenic exon-trapping by SINE (short interspersed sequence)-VNTR (variable number tandem repeat)-Alu (SVA) retrotransposon in cells of patients with FCMD and model mice, rescuing normal fukutin mRNA expression and protein production. They have discovered in human disease a role for SVA-mediated exon-trapping and demonstrated the promise of splicing modulation therapy as the first radical clinical treatment for FCMD.
