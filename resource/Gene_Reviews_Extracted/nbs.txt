Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome (NCBRS), the following evaluations are recommended: EEG to determine if seizures are present, with consideration of referral to an epileptologist for seizure management Neurologic and/or developmental examination to assess developmental milestones and identify neurologic findings or deficits Evaluation for occupational, speech, or physical therapy as needed Dental evaluation if dental eruption is delayed Audiology evaluation with auditory brain stem response testing and otoacoustic emission testing to assess for hearing loss Ophthalmologic examination, including visual acuity and dilated fundus examination Evaluation for cryptorchidism in males Consultation with a medical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Treatment of Manifestations

 The following are appropriate: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for seizures under the care of a neurologist or epileptologist Occupational, physical, and/or speech therapy to optimize developmental outcomes Spectacles as needed to correct refractive errors Hearing aids as needed Orchiopexy as needed

Surveillance

 Surveillance includes the following: At least yearly evaluation by a neurologist to assess for and/or manage seizures Yearly evaluation by a developmental pediatrician to assess developmental progress and therapeutic and educational interventions Regular follow up of ophthalmologic and/or audiologic abnormalities

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
