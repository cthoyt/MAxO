Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features (ADPEAF), the following evaluations are recommended: A clinical history from the individual and witnesses to establish seizure types and their frequencies, and symptoms associated with each seizure type Routine interictal EEG Routine clinical imaging to rule out structural abnormalities Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Treatment of Manifestations

ADPEAF is a benign syndrome in the great majority of individuals. No clinical trials of different antiepileptic medications have been carried out, but most individuals have been readily able to achieve seizure control with medications used routinely in clinical practice (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproate).

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

It is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and measures to minimize risk in the event of seizure onset (e.g., avoidance of unattended swimming). If the LGI1 or RELN pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives. If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, interview of relatives at risk may identify symptoms possibly related to seizures. See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
