Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with the primary autosomal recessive microcephalies (MCPH) and Seckel syndrome (SCKS) spectrum disorders, the following evaluations are recommended: Neurology consultation Age-adapted psychomotor or neuropsychological evaluation Electroencephalogram if seizures are suspected Review of brain MRI performed at the time of diagnosis to evaluate for malformations which can have a prognostic value in young children If short stature is present, skeletal survey (if not performed at the time of diagnosis)

Treatment of Manifestations

 Therapy is supportive and involves the following: Special education programs tailored to the needs of the individual Speech and language therapy Behavioral therapy as needed Occupational therapy as needed Community services that provide support for families Ritalin® may be helpful to treat marked hyperkinesia. Seizures are usually responsive to monotherapy with standard antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Growth hormone may be considered in individuals with mild growth retardation; objective efficiency of GH therapy has not been evaluated. Intubation may be difficult in affected individuals with small chin [Gürkan et al 2006].

Surveillance

 The following are appropriate: Monitoring of head circumference and stature using standard growth charts Neurologic follow-up from birth to adulthood to detect behavioral difficulties, hyperactivity, attention disorder, and motor problems (spasticity), and to monitor for evidence of seizures which can be late onset Periodic neuropsychologic evaluation in order to adapt interventions and schooling to the level of the individual's cognitive abilities
