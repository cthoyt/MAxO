It is appropriate to offer molecular genetic testing to at-risk relatives if the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member so that morbidity and mortality can be reduced by early diagnosis and treatment.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy may increase the size of a growth hormone-secreting adenoma or a prolactin-secreting adenoma (especially macroadenomas); thus, a pregnant woman with pituitary macroadenoma is at risk of developing visual field defects. In each trimester it is appropriate to inquire about headaches and perform visual field testing.
