It is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, a medical history to seek evidence of affected status should be elicited from relatives at risk.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
