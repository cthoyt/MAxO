It is appropriate to evaluate sibs and parents of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk family members.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known, ECG testing should be undertaken to evaluate for QT prolongation.

Standard newborn screening programs are sufficient to identify hearing loss in children with JLNS.

Because of the relationship between JLNS and long QT syndrome, ECG should be considered for relatives at risk for JLNS even if they have normal hearing.

If the JLNS-causing pathogenic variants in an affected family member are known, molecular genetic testing of a relative with congenital profound sensorineural hearing loss is recommended to confirm the diagnosis of JLNS.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Consideration should be given as to whether a mother who has a fetus affected with JLNS herself has long QT syndrome [Seth et al 2007].
