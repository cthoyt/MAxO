Molecular genetic testing of at-risk relatives in a family with PC is not indicated because the phenotype is readily observed from a young age and no interventions can prevent the development of manifestations or reduce their severity.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Increased risk to the fetus during pregnancy has not been reported.

For a pregnant woman with PC, weight gain (increasing stress on the plantar surface) or altered hormonal environment during pregnancy may worsen the painful plantar keratoderma.
