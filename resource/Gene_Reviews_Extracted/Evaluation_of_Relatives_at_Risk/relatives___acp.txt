It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of a proband (starting at age 15 years) in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from surveillance and initiation of treatment. However, the proper preventive approach for asymptomatic sibs is unknown:

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known;

Monitoring of serum concentrations of hemoglobin and hemoglobin A1c as anemia and diabetes may precede neurologic symptoms (see also Surveillance).

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
