It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures. Chelation therapy and iron supplementation can potentially prevent primary disease manifestations in asymptomatic individuals.

Evaluations include:

Molecular genetic testing if the SLC30A10 pathogenic variants in the family are known;

Periodic monitoring of whole-blood manganese concentration and hemoglobin if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

For an affected fetus, no prenatal treatment is recommended as the disease does not manifest before early childhood.

For an affected mother, no data or information on pregnancy management are available.
