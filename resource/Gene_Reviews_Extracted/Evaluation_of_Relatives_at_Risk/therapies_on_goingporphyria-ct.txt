Testing at-risk relatives of an individual with F-PCT to identify those with a UROD pathogenic variant is not expected to alter their management due to the low risk of development of the signs and symptoms of PCT. Nevertheless, if the family-specific UROD pathogenic variant is known, it is reasonable to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives so that those with a UROD pathogenic variant can avoid known susceptibility factors.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy is generally not complicated by F-PCT. Women with active F-PCT should be able to carry pregnancies to term [Aziz Ibrahim & Esen 2004, Tollanes et al 2011].

It is recommended that women with F-PCT be treated prior to the onset of planned pregnancies.
