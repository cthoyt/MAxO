It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic relatives of an affected individual by molecular genetic testing for the familial REN pathogenic variant in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures. Particularly important are:

Children because of their increased risk for anemia;

Adolescents because of their increased risk for gout, which can be prevented with allopurinol treatment;

Relatives interested in donating a kidney to an affected family member.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Successful pregnancies have been documented in women with a REN pathogenic variant. The rate of miscarriages or other adverse outcomes was not increased.
