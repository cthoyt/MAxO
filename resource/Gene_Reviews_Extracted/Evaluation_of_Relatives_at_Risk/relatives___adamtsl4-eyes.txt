Sibs of a proband with an ADAMTSL4-related eye disorder should undergo complete ophthalmologic evaluation (determination of visual acuity, measurement of intraocular pressure, slit lamp examination, and ophthalmoscopy) to allow early diagnosis and treatment of findings, primarily to prevent amblyopia.

If the pathogenic variants in a family are known, molecular genetic testing is likely to be more helpful that clinical examination in clarifying the genetic status of at-risk sibs, given the wide phenotypic variability even within the same family.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
