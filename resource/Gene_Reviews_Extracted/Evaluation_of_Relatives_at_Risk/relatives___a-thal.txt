The sibs of a proband should be evaluated as soon as possible after birth to determine if they have HbH disease so that appropriate monitoring can be instituted. Evaluations can include:

Evaluation of red blood cell indices, red blood cell supravital stain for HbH inclusions and hemoglobin analysis by HPLC

Targeted molecular analysis if the pathogenic variants in the family are known

Molecular genetic analysis (according to the frequency of Î±-globin gene pathogenic variants in each geographic area) if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

During pregnancy several complications have been reported in women with HbH disease, including worsening of anemia (with occasional need of red cell transfusions), preeclampsia, congestive heart failure, and threatened miscarriage [Origa et al 2007]. Monitoring for these possible complications is recommended.
