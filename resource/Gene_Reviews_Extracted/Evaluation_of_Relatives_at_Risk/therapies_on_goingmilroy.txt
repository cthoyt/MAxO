If the FLT4 pathogenic variant in a family is known, molecular genetic testing of at-risk relatives ensures identification of those who will benefit from treatment early in the disease course.

If the pathogenic variant in a family is not known, evaluation of relatives at risk by physical examination is appropriate in order to identify those who will benefit from treatment early in the course of the disease. The use of properly fitted compression hosiery and advice to reduce the risk of cellulitis of the legs and feet can be beneficial.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management 

Ultrasound scanning during pregnancy may indicate if a fetus is affected if swelling of the dorsum of the feet is noted in the second or third trimester. The fetus may have mild pleural effusions which frequently resolve before birth [S Mansour, personal communication]. Very rarely, the fetus may present with hydrops fetalis. If the mother is affected by Milroy disease there may be an increase in swelling during the pregnancy.
