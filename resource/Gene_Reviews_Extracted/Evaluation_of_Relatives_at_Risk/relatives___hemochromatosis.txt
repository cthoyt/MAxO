It is appropriate to clarify the status of apparently asymptomatic adult sibs and offspring of individuals homozygous for p.Cys282Tyr in order to identify those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

The following strategy is appropriate:

Offer molecular genetic testing to the adult sibs of an individual homozygous for p.Cys282Tyr.

Perform iron studies (i.e., transferrin iron saturation and serum concentration of ferritin) on those sibs who are homozygous for p.Cys282Tyr.

Begin phlebotomy therapy if serum ferritin concentration is elevated above the upper limits of normal and if the proband has clinical HFE-HH. Note: Sibs of probands with clinical HFE-HH appear to have a higher prevalence of clinical HFE-HH than asymptomatic individuals detected through screening programs.

Note: Genotype-based testing has been found to be cost effective in most individuals because it has excellent negative predictive value. However, genotype-based testing has a low positive predictive value because many p.Cys282Tyr homozygotes and compound heterozygotes will not express the disease [El-Serag et al 2000, Beutler et al 2002].

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

No guidelines exist; common practice is to withhold phlebotomy during pregnancy.
