The ATS/ERS guidelines recommend evaluation of older and younger sibs of an individual with severe AATD (Table 2) in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from institution of treatment and preventive measures.

The ATS/ERS guidelines also recommend testing for parents and children of individuals with severe AATD.

Extended pedigree analysis beyond first-degree relatives may be indicated in selected instances. For example, the presence of an AATD-associated condition (e.g., COPD, liver disease, panniculitis) in a more distant family member would justify extensive family testing (i.e., of family members beyond parents, sibs, and offspring).

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Management of women with AATD during pregnancy should be guided by usual care principles, both for women without clinical disease and for those with liver disease. As noted, emphysema, especially in non-smokers, would not commonly be expected during the usual childbearing age range.
