Evaluation of newborn at-risk males is recommended before any elective procedure such as circumcision.

It is appropriate to test at-risk males so that morbidity and mortality can be reduced by early diagnosis and treatment.

Rapid screening of at-risk males may be accomplished by WASP staining using flow cytometry.

Definitive testing is possible by molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant in the family is known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

There is no evidence that C-section reduces the risk of morbidity and mortality in males with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.
