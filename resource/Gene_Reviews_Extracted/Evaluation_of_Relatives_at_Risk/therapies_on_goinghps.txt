In individuals with HPS-1 and HPS-4, the diagnosis of HPS will be apparent because the hypopigmentation and nystagmus are clinically evident.

In rare families with the milder types (HPS-3, HPS-5, or HPS-6), the evaluation of apparently unaffected sibs may yield a positive diagnosis:

If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known, platelet aggregation or platelet whole mount electron microscopy studies can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancies should proceed normally for an affected mother or an affected fetus. Delivery, however, carries risk for bleeding in a woman with HPS; surveillance and a hematology consultation for anticipation of bleeding complications during delivery should be initiated once pregnancy is confirmed.
