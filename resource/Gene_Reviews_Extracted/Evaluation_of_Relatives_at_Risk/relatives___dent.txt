It is appropriate to evaluate male relatives at risk for Dent disease 1 (caused by mutation of CLCN5) or Dent disease 2 (caused by mutation of OCRL) in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, measurement of urinary excretion of low molecular-weight proteins (e.g., alpha 1 microglobulin, retinol binding protein) is a sensitive and specific test.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
