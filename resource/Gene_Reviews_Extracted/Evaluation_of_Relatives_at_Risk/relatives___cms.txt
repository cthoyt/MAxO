It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic at-risk relatives of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures, especially newborns or young children, who could benefit from early treatment to prevent sudden respiratory failure.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant in the family is known;

Neurologic/neuropediatric examination, electrophysiologic testing (repetitive nerve stimulation) if the pathogenic variant in the family is not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Data on pregnancies in CMS are limited. Seventeen pregnancies were reported in eight French patients with CMS [Servais et al 2013]. According to these data pregnancy was a frequent cause of clinical exacerbation but the vast majority of patients recovered their pre-pregnancy clinical status six months after delivery. The childrenâ€™s outcome was excellent, except for one newborn who developed a severe, neonatal (autosomal dominant) slow-channel CMS. Pregnant patients should be closely followed by neurologists during the course of pregnancy. Careful respiratory and cardiac surveillance should be initiated in consultation with obstetric specialists.
