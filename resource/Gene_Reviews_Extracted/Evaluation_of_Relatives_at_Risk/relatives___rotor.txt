Pregnancy Management

No special pregnancy management issues from the perspective of an affected mother and/or from the perspective of an affected fetus are known.

Of note, during pregnancy the hyperbilirubinemia of Rotor syndrome may complicate the diagnosis and management of liver disease related to pregnancy (e.g., intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy) and liver disease not related to pregnancy.
