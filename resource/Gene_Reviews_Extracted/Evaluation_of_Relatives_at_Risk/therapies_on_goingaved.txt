Predictive testing should be offered to all sibs of a proband, as timely treatment with vitamin E supplementation may completely avert the clinical manifestations of the disease.

All relatives at risk, especially younger sibs of a proband, should be evaluated for vitamin E deficiency.

If plasma vitamin E concentration is low, the person should be tested for presence of the TTPA pathogenic variants found in the proband so that individuals with biallelic pathogenic variants can be treated promptly with vitamin E supplementation.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Reduced vitamin E levels are associated with low fertility and embryo resorption in mice [Traber & Manor 2012] and α-tocopherol transfer protein is highly expressed in the human placenta [Müller-Schmehl et al 2004]; therefore, it is advisable to keep vitamin E levels in the high normal range during pregnancy.
