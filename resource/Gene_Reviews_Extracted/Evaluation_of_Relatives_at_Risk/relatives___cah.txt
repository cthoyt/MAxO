If prenatal testing for 21-OHD CAH has not been performed, it is appropriate to evaluate newborn sibs of a proband in order to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment.

Serum 17-OHP concentration should be measured in addition to newborn screening.

Molecular genetic testing is indicated if the pathogenic variants in the family are known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnant females with classic 21-OHD CAH. Pregnant females who have classic salt-wasting 21-OHD CAH need to be monitored closely by an endocrinologist during pregnancy. Maintenance doses of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid usually need to be increased because adrenal androgens tend to increase during pregnancy. Despite excess production of maternal adrenal androgens, the genitalia of their female fetuses are not virilized [Lo et al 1999].
