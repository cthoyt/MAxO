Using genomic testing that will detect the 15q13.3 microdeletion found in the proband, it is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from close assessment/monitoring of developmental milestones in childhood.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
