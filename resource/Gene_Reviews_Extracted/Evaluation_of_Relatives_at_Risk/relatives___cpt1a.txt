Because presentation in later childhood is possible, it is appropriate to evaluate each sib of a proband, regardless of age, in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of preventive measures.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the CPT1A pathogenic variants in the family are known.

Enzyme analysis in cultured skin fibroblasts if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Although data are limited, it is prudent to counsel unaffected female carriers regarding the risk for obstetric complications.

Women who have had one child with CPT1A deficiency following an uneventful pregnancy remain at risk for acute fatty liver of pregnancy in subsequent pregnancies with an affected fetus.

Pregnant females who are heterozygous for a CPT1A pathogenic variant should be monitored for acute fatty liver of pregnancy. In any pregnancies that follow identification of a child with CPT1A deficiency, liver function testing should be performed at each prenatal visit during the first two trimesters and more frequently during the third trimester when the risk for acute fatty liver of pregnancy is greatest. Management by a team comprising a maternal-fetal medicine specialist and a medical/biochemical geneticist is highly recommended.
