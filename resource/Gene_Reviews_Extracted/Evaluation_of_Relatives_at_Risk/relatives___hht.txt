It is appropriate to evaluate at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from preventive measures (see Prevention of Primary Manifestations) and prompt initiation of treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is known, evaluate with molecular genetic testing.

If the familial pathogenic variant is not known and, consequently, HHT cannot been ruled out by molecular diagnosis, at-risk family members should follow the same protocol as is recommended for individuals in whom the diagnosis of HHT is definite (see Surveillance).

Individuals older than age 40 years should have a targeted medical history and clinical examination for features of HHT. The absence of mild but recurrent epistaxis and subtle telangiectases in characteristic locations on careful examination is reassuring.

In individuals age 40 years and younger, targeted medical history and clinical examination for features of HHT in addition to an evaluation for brain and pulmonary AVMs should be done initially, as features of HHT may not be identified by medical history and clinical examination in younger individuals.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnant women with HHT and untreated pulmonary AVMs are also at high risk for lung hemorrhage and cerebral complications of air embolism. Women with treated pulmonary AVMs appear to be at no higher risk during pregnancy than those without pulmonary AVMs.
