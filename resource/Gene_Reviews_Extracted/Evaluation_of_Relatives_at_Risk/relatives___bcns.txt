It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives, including children, of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from surveillance (see Surveillance) for complications of NBCCS (most notably medulloblastoma in children and jaw cysts and BCCs in adults) and the need to avoid x-rays and sun exposure (see Agents/Circumstances to Avoid).

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant in the family is known;

Clinical examination and x-rays of the skull for calcification if the pathogenic variant in the family is not known; these may be less likely to clarify the genetic status in a very young child because of the age-related features of NBCCS.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Since individuals with NBCCS have a large head circumference, a woman who is carrying an affected fetus should be assessed for the need for either early induction of labor or caesarean section delivery due to cephalopelvic disproportion.
