For infants identified with high myopia, unusual head posture or nystagmus and a family history of CSNB, ophthalmic examination and molecular genetic testing may confirm the diagnosis of CSNB, obviating the need for neuroimaging or clinical electrophysiologic testing under sedation or general anesthesia.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
