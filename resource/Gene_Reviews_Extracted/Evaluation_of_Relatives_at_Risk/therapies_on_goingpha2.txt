It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment. Evaluations can include:

Measurement of serum potassium concentration and blood pressure;

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family is known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

During the pregnancy of a woman with PHAII, electrolytes and blood pressure should be monitored regularly and blood pressure medication adjusted as needed.

Some antihypertensive medications (including thiazide diuretics) have been associated with adverse fetal outcome, especially when taken during the first trimester of pregnancy. The best time to discuss the risk to the fetus associated with a maternal medication is prior to conception. Women with PHAII who become pregnant should be referred to an obstetrics group with expertise in high risk pregnancies.
