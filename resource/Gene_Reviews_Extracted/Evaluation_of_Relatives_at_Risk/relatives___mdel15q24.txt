Pregnancy Management

If a fetus is known to have 15q24 microdeletion syndrome, fetal echocardiogram and ultrasound examination with an attempt to visualize the palate and look for diaphragmatic hernia are recommended. Close monitoring for intrauterine growth retardation is warranted. Counseling with regard to the developmental outcomes and medical complications of the 15q24 microdeletion syndrome is appropriate. Delivery at a center with a good neonatal intensive care team is optimal, as respiratory complications and feeding difficulties may occur after delivery.
