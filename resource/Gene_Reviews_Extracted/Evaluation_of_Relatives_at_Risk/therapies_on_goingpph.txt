It is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

The WHO Symposia [Badesch et al 2009] recommends serial screening by echocardiography of at-risk family members every three to five years to enable earlier detection and treatment. However, many health insurers do not provide coverage for screening tests for asymptomatic individuals. No studies describe the frequency of compliance with the WHO recommendation.

In families with a known pathogenic variant in one of the genes known to be associated with HPAH, the use of molecular genetic testing to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives can allow individuals who do not have the family-specific pathogenic variant to safely forego clinical screening. However, the role of molecular genetic testing for early diagnosis of at-risk family members has yet to be established [Newman et al 2001].

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

The physiologic stress of pregnancy in a woman with HPAH is significant and maternal mortality is believed to be substantial; newer effective therapies may decrease the risk.

Anecdotal reports of onset of PAH with pregnancy raise concern about risks of pregnancy as a basis for developing PAH, but no consensus exists regarding the best approach to birth control in women with HPAH [Austin et al 2009a, Sweeney & Voelkel 2009].
