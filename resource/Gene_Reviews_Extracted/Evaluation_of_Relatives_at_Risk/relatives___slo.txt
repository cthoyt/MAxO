All sibs should be tested by measurement of 7DHC concentration in plasma or amniotic fluid (prenatally). In cases of borderline 7DHC concentration, molecular genetic testing is indicated. Caution must be exercised in interpreting elevated 7DHC concentration in individuals treated with haloperidol, aripiprazole, and tradozone [Hall et al 2013].

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

No current guidelines exist for the management of pregnant women with SLOS, as to date only one affected woman with a successful pregnancy has been identified [Ellingson et al 2014].
