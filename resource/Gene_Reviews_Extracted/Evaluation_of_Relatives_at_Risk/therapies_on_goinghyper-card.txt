If the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, clarification of the genetic status of at-risk family members (see Figure 1) allows appropriate longitudinal evaluation of those who have the pathogenic variant (see Surveillance and Table 2).

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

The hemodynamic changes associated with pregnancy and delivery place women with familial HCM at increased risk for obstetric complications, particularly if significant obstructive physiology is present. Perinatal care with specialists experienced in cardiovascular medicine and high-risk obstetrics is highly recommended.
