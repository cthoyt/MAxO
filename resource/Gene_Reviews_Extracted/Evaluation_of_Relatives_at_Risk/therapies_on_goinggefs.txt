Pregnancy Management

In addition to the considerations described in Genetic Counseling, other pregnancy-related considerations include the following:

Risk of major malformations (especially due to valproic acid exposure in utero [Samrén et al 1997]) and minor anomalies

Advantages and disadvantages of increasing maternal periconceptional folic acid supplementation to 4000 µg daily, particularly when women are taking valproic acid or carbamazepine during pregnancy

Effect of in utero exposure to anticonvulsants on future cognitive development [Meador et al 2009]

Effect of anticonvulsants on hormonal methods of birth control

Effects of anticonvulsants on conception; the risk for complications in mothers who are on anticonvulsants

Effect of pregnancy on anticonvulsant metabolism

Effect of pregnancy on maternal seizure control

Pregnancy, family planning, and contraception are issues that should be raised with every female near childbearing age who has epilepsy. These considerations are not unique to or (aside from medication selection) significantly influenced by the presence of an SCN1A-related seizure disorder.
