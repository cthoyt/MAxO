Molecular genetic testing should be offered to at-risk members of a family in which a germline MEN1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected relative [Lairmore et al 2004].

When molecular genetic testing for an MEN1 pathogenic variant is not possible or is not informative, individuals at 50% risk (i.e., first-degree relatives of an individual with MEN1 syndrome) should undergo routine evaluation (see Surveillance).

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
