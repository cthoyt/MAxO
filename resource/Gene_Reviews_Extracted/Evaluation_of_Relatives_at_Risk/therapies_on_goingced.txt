It is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk in order to identify the diagnosis as early as possible, avoid potential misdiagnosis, and provide appropriate treatment for extremity pain.

If the TGFB1 pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, radiographic evaluation for hyperostosis can be used to clarify the disease status of at-risk relatives.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
