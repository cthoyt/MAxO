Pregnancy Management

Women with OI who have significant skeletal deformity and short stature should be followed during pregnancy by a high-risk prenatal care center.

Delivery of an infant with OI by cesarean section or by vagina has about the same rate of complications for each type of OI. Delivery of an infant with OI by cesarean section is more frequent than in the general population because a non-vertex presentation cannot be corrected by external manipulation.
