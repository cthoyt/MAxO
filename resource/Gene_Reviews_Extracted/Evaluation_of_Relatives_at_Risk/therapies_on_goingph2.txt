In order to delay disease onset in asymptomatic relatives, it is prudent to screen at-risk family members before symptoms occur by measuring urinary oxalate excretion or by molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known. Molecular genetic testing tends to be more reliable as urine oxalate output can be variable in childhood.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
