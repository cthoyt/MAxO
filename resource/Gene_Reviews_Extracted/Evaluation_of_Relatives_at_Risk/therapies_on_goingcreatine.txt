It is appropriate to evaluate neonates at-risk for GAMT deficiency or AGAT deficiency to allow for early diagnosis and treatment.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known;

Biochemical genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to evaluation of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
