It is appropriate to evaluate sibs of a proband who are younger than age 12 months in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures. The majority of children with VODI present before age six months; however, as one child presented at age 11 months, testing should be considered in sibs of a proband who are younger than age 12 months.

Evaluations include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known;

Serum immunoglobulins, full blood count and liver function tests at birth and repeated at six months if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

Penetrance is complete (i.e., 100%) in the individuals with VODI described to date; thus, molecular genetic testing of healthy at-risk sibs of a proband who are older than age 12 months is not recommended.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

For an affected pregnant woman, ongoing intravenous immunoglobulin to prevent infection related to severe hypogammaglobulinemia and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis to prevent Pneumocystis jirovecii infection is appropriate during pregnancy. There is evidence that early treatment of a baby known to be homozygous for pathogenic SP110 pathogenic variants may result in improved long-term outcomes.
