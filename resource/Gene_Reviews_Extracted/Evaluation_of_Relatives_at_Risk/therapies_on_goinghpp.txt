When a pathogenic variant is identified in a proband, molecular genetic testing of at-risk, asymptomatic family members is appropriate because of the risk for unexpected acute paralysis and/or malignant hyperthermia.

When the results of presymptomatic testing are not known, the at-risk family members must be considered at risk for complications and precautions must be taken, particularly in the administration of anesthesia and avoidance of risk factors.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

While in utero acetazolamide exposure is reported to cause limb defects in rodents, acetazolamide therapy during human pregnancy does not appear to increase the risk for fetal malformations [Heinonen et al 1977].
