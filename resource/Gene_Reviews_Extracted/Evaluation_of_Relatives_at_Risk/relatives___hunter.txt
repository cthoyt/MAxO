Although clinical experience suggests that early diagnosis of at-risk males allows initiation of ERT before the onset of irreversible changes and often before significant disease progression [Muenzer 2014], it is unclear at present whether early diagnosis (either by newborn screening or testing of at-risk male relatives) is beneficial as no data are available on whether early ERT improves the outcome of the somatic disease in MPS II. ERT is not expected to benefit children with the CNS form of the disease.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
