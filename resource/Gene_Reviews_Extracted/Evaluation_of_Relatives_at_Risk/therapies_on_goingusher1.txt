It is appropriate to evaluate the hearing of all sibs at risk for Usher syndrome type I as soon after birth as possible to allow early diagnosis and treatment of hearing impairment.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known.

Auditory brain stem response (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
