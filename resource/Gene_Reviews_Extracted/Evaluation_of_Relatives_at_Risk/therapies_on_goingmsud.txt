Early diagnosis of at-risk sibs of an affected individual may allow asymptomatic infants to be managed out of hospital by experienced providers.

Newborn at-risk sibs who have not undergone prenatal testing can be tested in one of two ways:

Plasma amino acid analysis of a sample obtained at approximately 24 hours of life. In some laboratories, samples obtained earlier can yield false negative results.

If the pathogenic variants have been identified in the family, a cord blood sample can be used for molecular genetic testing.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

With the advent of newborn screening and preventive care, more women with MSUD are surviving to child-bearing age. Successful delivery of a healthy baby is possible for women with classic MSUD. Reports include Van Calcar et al [1992] and Grünewald et al [1998].

Elevated maternal leucine plasma concentration, like elevated maternal phenylalanine plasma concentration, is likely teratogenic. If a woman with MSUD is planning a pregnancy, metabolic control should be maintained in a rigorous fashion preceding and throughout the gestation. Keeping the maternal plasma levels of the branched-chain amino acids between 100 and 300 μmol/L is compatible with delivery of a normal infant [Grünewald et al 1998].

During the development of the placenta and fetus, maternal BCAA and protein requirements increase, and frequent monitoring of plasma amino acid concentrations and fetal growth may be necessary to avoid essential amino acid deficiencies [Grünewald et al 1998].

The post-partum period is dangerous for the mother. Catabolic stress of labor, involutional changes of the uterus, and internal sequestration of blood are potential sources of metabolic decompensation [Chuang & Shih 2001]. Appropriate monitoring at a metabolic referral center is advised at the time of delivery.
