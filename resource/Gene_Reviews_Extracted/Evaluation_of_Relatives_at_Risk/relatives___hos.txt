It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from appropriate cardiac management. Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the TBX5 pathogenic variant in the family is known;

Echocardiography, ECG, and hand x-rays (anterior/posterior view) if the pathogenic variant in the family is not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnant women with HOS who have a known history of a structural cardiac defect or cardiac conduction abnormality should be followed by a multidisciplinary team (including a cardiologist) during pregnancy. Affected women who have not undergone cardiac evaluation should do so prior to pregnancy if possible, or as soon as the pregnancy is recognized.
