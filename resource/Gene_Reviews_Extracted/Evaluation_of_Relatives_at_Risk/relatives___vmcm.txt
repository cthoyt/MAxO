Evaluating at-risk neonates by physical examination is appropriate in order to identify those who may benefit from early treatment.

Lesions arising after infancy usually stay small and therefore are rarely symptomatic. If no lesions are seen at birth, a second evaluation should be done around puberty.

If the TEK pathogenic variant has been identified in the family, molecular genetic testing can be used to evaluate at-risk relatives.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management 

During pregnancy, affected women may develop small new lesions; in addition, existing lesions may increase in size and become painful. If the D-dimer level is high, low molecular-weight heparin therapy may be used to alleviate pain.
