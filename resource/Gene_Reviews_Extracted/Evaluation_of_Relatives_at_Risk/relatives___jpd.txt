Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy in women with Parkinson disease is a rare event. Only one case of a successful pregnancy in a woman with parkin type of early-onset Parkinson disease has been reported [Serikawa et al 2011]. The 27-year old woman successfully gave birth to spontaneously conceived dichorionic/diamnionic male twins. Exacerbation of her motor disabilities was noted during late pregnancy. She was treated with levodopa/carbidopa only during the period of organogenesis. Both babies were born healthy, without any evidence of psychomotor impairment two years after birth.

Worsening of parkinsonian symptoms could in part be explained by the reduction of dopaminergic replacement therapy. If possible, dopaminergic medication should be limited to levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitor to minimize the potential risk for teratogenicity at least over the course of the embryonic phase.
