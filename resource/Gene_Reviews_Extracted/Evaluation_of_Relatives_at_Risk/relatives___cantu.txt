If the pathogenic ABCC9 or KCNJ8 variant in an affected family member is known, relatives at risk who are suspected of having Cantú syndrome can be offered molecular genetic testing to clarify their genetic status. Family members who are affected should be evaluated (see Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis and Surveillance).

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy of a fetus with Cantú syndrome warrants monitoring for:

Polyhydramnios. The cause of polyhydramnios is unknown. In some instances, severe polyhydramnios has required serial amniotic fluid reductions and has led to premature labor and delivery.

Macrosomia. It is unknown if fetal size warrants special consideration at the time of delivery.
