Early evaluation and/or molecular genetic testing (if the two pathogenic allelic variants in a family are known) of at-risk sibs allows for early diagnosis and early treatment of manifestations.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

There are no data to guide the management of a pregnancy should it occur in a female with Alstr√∂m syndrome. Potential maternal complications during pregnancy could include development or worsening of cardiac, renal, or hepatic failure; severe dyslipidemia; and hyperglycemia. The fetus could be affected by placental dysfunction resulting from maternal diabetes and cardiorenal disease. Intensive multidisciplinary surveillance of any pregnancy would be mandatory.
