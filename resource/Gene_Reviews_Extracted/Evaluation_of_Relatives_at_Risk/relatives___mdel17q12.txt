If genomic testing detects the 17q12 recurrent deletion in one of the probandâ€™s parents, it is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of older and younger sibs of the proband and other relatives at risk in order to identify those who would benefit from close assessment/monitoring for evidence of renal structural or functional defects, maturity-onset diabetes of the young, and developmental delays/intellectual disability.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
