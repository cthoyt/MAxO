It is appropriate to test relatives at risk* for the ALK pathogenic variant found in the proband to identify those at high risk for neuroblastoma, for whom early detection of neuroblastoma and initiation of therapy would likely improve quality of life and may affect outcome (if therapy is started prior to end organ damage).

*Sibs who are younger than age ten years at the time of diagnosis of the proband, as well as sibs born subsequently.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
