Pregnancy Management 

When TD has been diagnosed prenatally, potential pregnancy complications include prematurity, polyhydramnios, malpresentation, and cephalopelvic disproportion caused by macrocephaly from hydrocephalus or a flexed and rigid neck. Cephalocentesis and cesarean section may be considered to avoid maternal complications.

Management of an affected pregnancy is directed by the level of parental desire for heroic life-saving measures and is often highly center-specific. It can be addressed on three levels:

Maternal. Surveillance for cephalopelvic disproportion, polyhydramnios, and/or preterm labor; avoidance of emergency C-section for fetal distress

Fetal. Surveillance for malpresentation, periodic prenatal ultrasound monitoring of head circumference, MRI for fetal lung volume, and/or fetal stress testing

Familial. Establishment of a perinatal plan for assessment, care, and/or withdrawal of care after delivery
