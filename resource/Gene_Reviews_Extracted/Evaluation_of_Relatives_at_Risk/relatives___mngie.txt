It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the TYMP pathogenic variants in the family are known;

Measurements of thymidine phosphorylase enzyme (See Establishing the Diagnosis, thymidine phosphorylase enzyme) activity or plasma concentrations of thymidine and deoxyuridine (see Establishing the Diagnosis, Plasma concentrations of thymidine and deoxyuridine) if the TYMP pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
