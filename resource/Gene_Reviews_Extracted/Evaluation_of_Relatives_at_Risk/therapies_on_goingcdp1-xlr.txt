It is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger at-risk relatives of an individual with CDPX1 in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early screening for hearing loss. If the ARSE pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to evaluation of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
