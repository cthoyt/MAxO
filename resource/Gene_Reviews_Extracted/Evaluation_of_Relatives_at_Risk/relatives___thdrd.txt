It is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment.

Evaluations include:

Clinical examination to identify mild dystonic and/or parkinsonian symptoms or unexplained gait disorders;

Molecular genetic testing if the TH pathogenic variants have been identified in the family.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
