It is appropriate to evaluate at-risk sibs in early childhood in order to identify those who will develop sensory loss and would benefit from measures to prevent injury to limbs and/or self-mutilation. Molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs if the pathogenic variants in the family are known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
