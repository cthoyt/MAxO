It is appropriate to evaluate older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt treatment of hearing loss and myopia. Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the SLITRK6 pathogenic variants in the family are known;

Clinical audiology and ophthalmology evaluations if a molecular diagnosis has not been established.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
