If prenatal testing for IMAGe syndrome has not been performed, it is appropriate to evaluate newborn sibs of a proband to enable prompt diagnosis and management of adrenal insufficiency.

Molecular genetic testing is indicated if the CDKN1C pathogenic variant in the family is known;

If the CDKN1C pathogenic variant in the family is not known, family members can be screened for serum electrolyte abnormalities, elevated serum ACTH level, and skeletal features of IMAGe syndrome, including short stature and delayed bone age.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Risks to a mother with IMAGe syndrome during pregnancy include potential adrenal insufficiency; risks during delivery include cephalopelvic disproportion.
