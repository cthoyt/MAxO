Pregnancy Management

The pregnancy management of a woman with a KCNQ2 pathogenic variant and epilepsy does not differ from that of any other pregnant woman with a seizure disorder.

A fetus with a KCNQ2 pathogenic variant may have neonatal seizures in the first few days of life. Therefore, a woman who is carrying a fetus at risk of inheriting a KCNQ2-related disorder should consider delivering in a hospital with a neonatal intensive care unit.
