Plasma concentrations of total homocysteine and amino acids should be measured in at-risk sibs as soon as possible after birth so that morbidity and mortality can be reduced by early diagnosis and treatment.

If the CBS pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of sibs.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Because women with homocystinuria may be at greater than average risk for thromboembolism, especially post partum, prophylactic anticoagulation during the third trimester of pregnancy and post partum is recommended. The usual regimen is injection of low molecular-weight heparin during the last two weeks of pregnancy and the first six weeks post partum [Pierre et al 2006]. Aspirin in low doses has also been given throughout pregnancy.

Maternal homocystinuria, unlike maternal phenylketonuria (see Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Deficiency), does not appear to have major teratogenic potential requiring additional counseling or, with respect to the fetus, more stringent management [Levy et al 2002, Vilaseca et al 2004]. Nevertheless, treatment with pyridoxine or methionine-restricted diet or both should be continued during pregnancy [Morris et al 2017]. Betaine may also be continued and appears not to be teratogenic [Yap et al 2001b, Levy et al 2002, Vilaseca et al 2004, Pierre et al 2006].
