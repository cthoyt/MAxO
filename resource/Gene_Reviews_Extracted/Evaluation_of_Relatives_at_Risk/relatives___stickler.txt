Because of the variable expression of Stickler syndrome [Faber et al 2000], it is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband as well as other at-risk relatives in order to identify those who warrant ongoing evaluation (see Surveillance). Evaluation can be done in one of two ways:

By documenting medical history and performing physical examination and ophthalmologic, audiologic, and radiographic assessments. The examination of childhood photographs may be helpful in the assessment of craniofacial findings of adults, since the craniofacial findings characteristic of Stickler syndrome may become less distinctive with age.

By molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known

It is recommended that relatives at risk in whom the diagnosis of Stickler syndrome cannot be excluded with certainty be followed for potential complications.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
