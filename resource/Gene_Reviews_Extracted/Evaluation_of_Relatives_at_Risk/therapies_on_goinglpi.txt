If the pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, it is appropriate to offer molecular genetic testing to at-risk sibs in order to reduce morbidity and mortality through early diagnosis and treatment.

When molecular testing is not available, early diagnosis of at-risk sibs relies on careful clinical evaluation and determination of plasma and urinary amino acid concentrations and orotic acid urinary excretion.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
