If the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, it is appropriate to offer molecular genetic testing to at-risk relatives so that morbidity and mortality can be reduced by early diagnosis and treatment.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, it is appropriate to offer clinical diagnostic evaluations to identify those family members who will benefit from early treatment.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
