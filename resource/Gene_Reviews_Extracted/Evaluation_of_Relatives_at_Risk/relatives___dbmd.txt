Heterozygous females need to be identified for the purpose of cardiac surveillance (see Surveillance). Therefore, genetic counseling and molecular genetic testing (if the family-specific pathogenic variant is known) should be offered to females who are the sisters or maternal female relatives of an affected male and to females who are a first-degree relative of a known or possible carrier female.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management for Heterozygous Females

Symptomatic heterozygous women should undergo an evaluation for dilated cardiomyopathy ideally prior to conceiving a pregnancy or as soon as the pregnancy is recognized. Asymptomatic heterozygous women should consider undergoing a cardiac evaluation prior to conception or when a pregnancy is recognized. Those with evidence of dilated cardiomyopathy should be treated and/or monitored by a cardiologist and a high-risk obstetrician.
