It is appropriate to evaluate the apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from institution of treatment and preventive measures.

Evaluations can include karyotype in sibs who have normal external female genitalia but have not yet undergone menarche.

Molecular genetic testing can be pursued next if a phenotypic female is found to have a 46,XY karyotype and if the AR variant in the family is known.

Androgen binding assays may be considered if an AR variant has not been identified in the family.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
