Depending on the genotype and phenotype of the proband, evaluation of sibs at risk should be performed using biochemical testing with treatment instituted as soon as possible if a sib is affected. Molecular genetic testing (if the pathogenic variants in the family are known) or cellular enzymology typically can further confirm the results of biochemical studies. Prenatal diagnosis of at-risk sibs may allow for prompt treatment of affected newborns at the time of delivery.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Oral and intramuscular vitamin B12 has been administered to women pregnant with a fetus with vitamin B12-responsive MMA, resulting in decreased maternal MMA urine output [Ampola et al 1975, van der Meer et al 1990]. Despite these observations, maternal vitamin B12 supplementation for isolated MMA needs further study.

Despite high maternal MMA levels, fetal growth and development were normal for all reported pregnancies of women with MMA [Wasserstein et al 1999, Deodato et al 2002].

Complications observed in pregnancies of women with MMA can include acute decompensation or hyperammonemia, deterioration of renal function, and obstetric complications including preeclampsia, preterm delivery, and c√¶sarean section [Raval et al 2015].
