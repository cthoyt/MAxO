Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with ADNP-related intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders (ADNP-related ID/ASD), the following evaluations are recommended: Physical examination to assess hypotonia, joint laxity, and obesity Anamnestic interview focusing on sleep problems and feeding difficulties Neurologic evaluation, including EEG if seizures are suspected, and brain MRI to detect brain abnormalities (if not performed as part of the diagnostic evaluation) In infants and children, comprehensive developmental assessment including gross and fine motor skills and speech and language; evaluation for autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability Psychiatric evaluation if behavioral problems are present Ophthalmologic examination and vision assessment, including electrophysiologic and visual perception examination to detect cortical visual impairment Ultrasound of the heart to evaluate for cardiac anomalies Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Treatment of Manifestations

 Treatment is symptomatic; no specific therapy is available. Routine medical care by a pediatrician or primary care physician is recommended: Speech, occupational, and physical therapy Specialized learning programs depending on individual needs Treatment of any neuropsychiatric features including sleep disorders, behavioral problems, and/or seizures Nutritional support if necessary Routine treatment of cardiac and ophthalmologic findings

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Therapies Under Investigation

 Administration of NAP, a neuroprotective octapeptide (NAPVSPIQ), has been reported to ameliorate some of the cognitive abnormalities observed in a knockout mouse model [Bassan et al 1999, Vulih-Shultzman et al 2007]. It restores learning and memory and reduces neurodegeneration in Adnp+/âˆ’ mice. The drug name for NAP is davunetide, a candidate for treatment of multiple selected neurologic disorders. Intranasal and intravenous formulations of the drug have been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier. Phase II and Phase III clinical trials showed good tolerance without significant side effects. Although it is not known whether the disease is the result of a loss of function of ADNP and although the mouse model has not been evaluated for autistic traits, the observations raise hope for treatment in patients with an ADNP-related ID/ASD [Vandeweyer et al 2014].
