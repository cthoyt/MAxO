Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with the Kleefstra syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended following the initial diagnosis: Complete review of systems Physical and neurologic examination Renal ultrasound examination to evaluate for possible renal/urologic anomalies Echocardiogram and ECG to evaluate for possible structural cardiac anomalies and atrial rhythm defects; follow-up depending on the severity of any cardiac anomaly identified Speech/language evaluation including audiologic examination Assessment for signs and symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) Physical and/or occupational therapy assessment Sleep history EEG if seizures are suspected Neuroimaging (MRI) especially in the presence of findings such as seizures and/or movement disorder, extreme apathy/catatonia, and/or regression in psychomotor development Clinical genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations

 The following are indicated: Ongoing routine pediatric care by a pediatrician or neurologist, psychiatrist, and/or (for adults) specialist in the care of adults with intellectual disability Depending on the age of the affected individual, referral to an early childhood intervention program, ongoing special education programs, and/or vocational training Speech/language therapy, physical and occupational therapy, and sensory integration therapy Specialized neurologic and psychiatric care for individuals with extreme behavior problems and/or movement disorder. Behavioral therapies include special education techniques that may help minimize behavioral outbursts in the school setting by emphasizing individualized instruction, structure, and a set daily routine. Therapeutic management of the sleep disorder. No well-controlled treatment trials have been reported Specialized neurologic care for individuals with epilepsy; management of seizures in accordance with standard practice Standard treatment for cardiac, renal, urologic, and other medical issues Auditory amplification if hearing loss is identified

Surveillance

 Cardiac and renal/urologic abnormalities should be monitored as needed.
