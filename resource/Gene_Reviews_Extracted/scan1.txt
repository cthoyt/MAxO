Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy (SCAN1), the following evaluations are recommended: complete neurologic examination (including assessment of muscle strength, reflexes, coordination, and sensation) is appropriate.

Treatment of Manifestations

Prostheses, walking aids, and wheelchairs are helpful for mobility depending on disabilities. Physical therapy may be helpful in maintaining a more active lifestyle.

Surveillance

Routine visits to a neurologist are appropriate.

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid

Exposure to genotoxic anti-cancer drugs such as camptothecins (e.g., irinotecan and topotecan) and bleomycin is likely to be extremely harmful and possibly fatal [Hirano et al 2007]. Exposure to radiation is likely to be extremely harmful and possibly fatal [El-Khamisy et al 2007].

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
