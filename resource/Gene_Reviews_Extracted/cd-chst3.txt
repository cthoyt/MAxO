Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with CHST3-related skeletal dysplasia, the following evaluations are recommended: Orthopedic referral Referral to a specialized skeletal dysplasia clinic if available Echocardiogram

Treatment of Manifestations

The main focus of treatment has thus far been surgical correction of the abnormal joints. Presumably because of the basic defect present in CHST3-related skeletal dysplasia, surgical correction is often only partially successful and most patients have had multiple procedures by adulthood [Unger et al 2010]. Of note, physical therapy has not been demonstrated to be effective in this disorder.

Surveillance

Thus far, heart valve dysplasia has not required correction; thus, no firm guidelines for appropriate surveillance have been developed. Echocardiogram is suggested at time of diagnosis and, if normal, should probably be repeated at intervals of five years.

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid

Activities with a high impact on joints (e.g., jogging) should be avoided. Obesity, which places an excessive load on the large weight-bearing joints, should be avoided.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
