Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with myopathy with deficiency of ISCU, the following evaluations are recommended: Consideration of cardiac evaluation in an affected individual who has at least one pathogenic variant that is not the common Swedish pathogenic splice site variant No special evaluations in an affected individual who is homozygous for the common Swedish pathogenic splice site variant Clinical genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations

No specific therapy currently exists for this disorder.

Prevention of Primary Manifestations

The major management goal is to prevent episodes of rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this goal may be achieved by avoiding sustained fatiguing physical exertion.

Prevention of Secondary Complications

The major secondary complications are those attributable to rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria, including renal failure and hyperkalemia. Management is similar to that for other causes of rhabdomyolysis including monitoring of renal and electrolyte status, maintenance of intravascular volume and urinary output, urine alkalinization, and institution of dialysis when needed [Malinoski et al 2004].

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid

Avoid sustained fatiguing physical exertion.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Therapies Under Investigation

Antisense oligonucleotides that induce skipping of the aberrant splice site produced by the pathogenic variant have restored normal mRNA splicing in fibroblasts from affected individuals [Kollberg & Holme 2009], suggesting a potential role for this type of therapy.
