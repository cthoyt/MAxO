Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with hereditary fibrosing poikiloderma with tendon contractures, myopathy, and pulmonary fibrosis (POIKTMP), the following evaluations are recommended: Dermatologic evaluation Physical therapy assessment Evaluation by pulmonary specialists including pulmonary function testing to evaluate for restrictive lung disease and/or pulmonary fibrosis Muscle MRI to evaluate for progressive muscle involvement (optional) Blood tests: Liver function: SGOT, SGPT, ALP, GGT Baseline complete blood count with differential. Individuals with clinical evidence of anemia or cytopenias should be evaluated by CBC and bone marrow biopsy if clinically indicated. Fecal elastase level if steatorrhea is present Ophthalmologic examination to evaluate for cataracts or other abnormalities Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Treatment of Manifestations

 
            Dermatologic Avoidance of excessive sun exposure and use of sunscreens with both UVA and UVB protection Pulsed dye laser can be discussed in older individuals as an option for cosmetic management of the telangiectatic component of the rash; however, no data on its use are available. Avoidance of excessive heat exposure and control of fever, especially in the first years of life to prevent overheating Lymphedema management (manual lymphatic drainage, compression) Topical treatment for eczema-like lesions (emollients, topical steroids) 
            Muscle Physical therapy and exercise to promote mobility and prevent contractures Calcium and vitamin D supplements may also be warranted in individuals with muscle weakness to prevent osteopenia. 
            Lung Use of self-inflating manual ventilation bag or mechanical insufflation-exsufflation device if needed Noninvasive ventilation if needed Pancreas. Treatment of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency with pancreatic enzyme supplementation Liver. Treatment of cholestasis with ursodeoxycholic acid Growth. Enteral feeding as needed Cataract. Surgical removal of visually significant cataracts

Surveillance

 Annual surveillance beginning at the time of diagnosis (to be adapted to patientâ€™s symptoms): Dermatologic evaluation for poikiloderma, lymphedema of the limbs, eczema-like lesions, changes in the nails and hair Physical therapy assessment for muscle weakness or contractures Pulmonary function testing Blood test: Complete blood count with differential Liver function testing: SGOT, SGPT, ALP, GGT Ophthalmologic examination Monitoring for orthopedic complications, especially contractures (with attention to Achilles tendon contractures) and scoliosis

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid

 Avoid the following: Excessive sun exposure, which may exacerbate the rash Exposure to heat because of heat intolerance secondary to hypohidrosis

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk
