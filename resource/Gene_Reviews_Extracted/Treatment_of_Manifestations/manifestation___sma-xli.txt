Management is similar to that for classic SMA type 0 and SMA type I, caused by mutation of SMN. See Spinal Muscular Atrophy.

Feeding/growth

If oral intake is not adequate, consider higher-calorie feeds and fat supplementation.

If weight gain is inadequate or the child cannot feed appropriately, consider nasogastric and possibly gastrostomy-tube placement.

Watch for swallowing dysfunction and consider a formal swallowing evaluation, especially if coughing or choking and/or recurrent pneumonias are evident as they may be signs of aspiration.

Manage gastroesophageal reflux disorder in the standard manner.

Manage constipation (resulting from weak abdominal musculature and poor motility) with diet (fiber and water content).

Respiratory

Provide rigorous pulmonary toilet, supplemental oxygen, and noninvasive ventilatory support.

Assist cough through mechanical devices or other means if the patient has ineffective cough.

Secretion mobilization may be achieved through chest physiotherapy and postural drainage.

Use oral suctioning as needed.

Use oximetry to monitor the patientâ€™s oxygen exchange status [Wang et al 2007].

In some cases artificial ventilation and tracheostomy may be employed.

As in classic SMA, discuss "do not attempt to resuscitate" status with the family before respiratory failure occurs. This discussion may begin earlier, but is appropriate when abdominal breathing is present and/or the forced vital capacity is less than 30%. See Spinal Muscular Atrophy for further discussion of respiratory support in SMA.

Sleep. Perform a sleep study if sleep-disordered breathing is suspected. Manage accordingly.

Orthopedic. Orthopedic management and physical and occupational therapy are indicated to manage contractures and prevent development of further contractures related to muscle weakness.
