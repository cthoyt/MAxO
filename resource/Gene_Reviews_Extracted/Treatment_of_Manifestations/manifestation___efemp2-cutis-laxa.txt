Hernia. Routine repair is appropriate.

Pulmonary emphysema is treated symptomatically. Tracheostomy may be necessary when retrognathia leads to upper airway obstruction.

Arterial abnormalities. No definitive treatment is available. Based on experience in other related disorders (e.g., Marfan syndrome), treatment with beta-blockers or angiotensin receptor blockers can be considered when aortic root dilatation is present. However, the efficacy of these interventions in EFEMP2- related disorders has not been proven. Surgical repair of large aortic aneurysms (at risk for dissection) should be considered. Aortic aneurysm replacement has been performed successfully

Joint hypermobility can be supported by muscle reinforcing physical therapy.
