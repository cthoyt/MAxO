In children with hypotonia and delayed motor development, a physiotherapeutic program is important.

Non-weight-bearing muscular exercise, such as swimming, is useful to promote muscular development and coordination.

Individuals with muscle hypotonia and joint instability with chronic pain may have to adjust lifestyle and professional choices accordingly. Emotional support and behavioral and psychological therapy may help in developing acceptance and coping skills.

Dermal wounds should be closed without tension, preferably in two layers. Deep stitches should be applied generously. Cutaneous stitches should be left in place twice as long as usual and additional fixation of adjacent skin with adhesive tape can help prevent stretching of the scar.

For recommendations on treatment of joint laxity and dislocations, see EDS, Hypermobility Type. (Note: Surgical stabilization of joints may lead to disappointing, or only temporary, improvement.)

Anti-inflammatory drugs may help with joint pain.

Long-term chronic pain may result in the need for mental health services.

Cardiovascular problems should be treated in a standard manner.
