Hypogammaglobulinemia is treated via intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), which should commence at the diagnosis of VODI or in presymptomatic sibs confirmed to have homozygous SP110 pathogenic variants. An appropriate dose is 0.4 g/kg every four weeks adjusting the dose to maintain a trough IgG level greater than 6 g/L.

Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole pediatric suspension (5 mL = trimethoprim 40 mg and sulfamethoxazole 200 mg) should be ongoing in children with VODI who tolerate this medication. This may be administered as a single daily dose or as a single dose three days per week. The recommended dose is 5 mg trimethoprim per kg (0.625 mL/kg) or 150 mg/M2 (3.75 mL/M2).

Infections with specific agents should be treated with appropriate supportive care and antibacterials or antivirals.

Hepatic transplantation may be considered, but appears to have a high rate of complications in the VODI cohort studied to date (see Other).

Bone marrow transplantation.

Ganaiem et al [2013] reported that this may be an efficacious treatment modality with appropriate conditioning therapy (see Other).
