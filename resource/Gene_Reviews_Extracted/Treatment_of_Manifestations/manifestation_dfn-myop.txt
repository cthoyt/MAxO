Appropriate treatment includes the following:

Implementation of hearing habilitation devices including hearing aids and vibrotactile hearing tools as needed

Consideration of cochlear implantation (CI) in individuals with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss and auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder. Although no CI has been reported among individuals with deafness and myopia syndrome, favorable outcome of CI has been reported in children with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder [Breneman et al 2012].

Enrollment in early intervention programs and educational programs for the hearing impaired to maximize long-term speech and language outcomes

Routine correction of refractive error
