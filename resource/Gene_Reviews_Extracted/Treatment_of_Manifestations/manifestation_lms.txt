Specific treatment for LMS does not currently exist. Supportive management of the clinical finding depends on the involved system as outlined below.

Lateral spinal meningoceles. Symptomatic treatment of neurologic sequelae (e.g., neurogenic bladder, paresthesias, back pain, and/or paraparesis) is as per routine.

Although rarely required, surgical intervention may be necessary for neurologic manifestations secondary to meningocele size and location. When required, surgical approach is individualized and can include laminectomy for smaller meningoceles and costotransversectomy for larger meningoceles [Kim et al 2011]. Of note, the 55-year-old woman with LMS experienced irreversible nerve damage following surgery for two lumbosacral meningoceles (to manage back and referred neuropathic pain) [Castori et al 2014].

Psychomotor development. Provide timely supportive interventions as needed to optimize development through occupational therapy and education resources.

Musculoskeletal

Management by specialists in chronic pain management or rehabilitation medicine as needed

Physiotherapy to reduce risk for joint subluxation and dislocation

Routine management of the following:

Cleft palate

Hearing loss

Congenital cardiac defects

Genitourinary abnormalities

GERD. Note that a feeding tube may be necessary if persistent feeding difficulties result in failure to thrive.
