A pediatric neurologist with expertise in the management of infantile spasms and medically refractory epilepsy is essential for long-term management of seizures.

Individuals with Aicardi syndrome usually require multiple antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for adequate seizure control. Improved outcome with vigabatrin [Chau et al 2004] and vagus nerve stimulators has been reported; however, these treatments do not work for all [Van den Veyver & Sutton, unpublished observation].

Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and vision therapy should begin at diagnosis to ensure the best functionality and developmental outcome possible. An individualized therapy plan should be developed and implemented by the therapists and caregivers.

Resection of large choroid plexus papillomas has been reported for management of hydrocephalus [Taggard & Menezes 2000]. Improvement of seizures was also noted in the individual reported. Whether this improvement was related to resolution of the hydrocephalus or whether the choroid plexus papillomas may have been epileptogenic is not clear.
