Treatment is supportive. Care is best provided by a multidisciplinary team including a metabolic pediatrician, pediatric neurologist, dietician, and physical therapist when possible.

Applicable supportive treatment [SB Wortmann, personal communication] includes:

For (progressive) spasticity. Some patients experienced (temporary) improvement of spasticity with treatment with oral or intrathecal baclofen.

For excessive drooling. Patients experienced great improvement (e.g., of respiratory problems) with botulinum toxin injection in the salivary glands, extirpation of salivary glands, and/or re-routing of glandular ducts.

For failure to thrive. An age-appropriate diet given via nasogastric tube or gastrostomy can greatly improve overall clinical condition.
