Although newborn screening for biotinidase deficiency has resulted in almost complete ascertainment of children with biotinidase deficiency in the United States and in many other countries, occasionally a child who has not been screened or has been mistakenly thought to have normal biotinidase activity on newborn screening will present with clinical symptoms. These children may become metabolically compromised and require hydration, occasionally bicarbonate for acidosis, and procedures to ameliorate hyperammonemia. Once it is recognized that the child has a multiple carboxylase deficiency, administration of biotin – or a multivitamin “cocktail” containing biotin – can rapidly resolve the metabolic derangement and improve many of the clinical symptoms within hours to days.

Compliance with biotin therapy (see Prevention of Primary Manifestations) improves symptoms in symptomatic individuals.

Some features such as optic atrophy, hearing loss, or developmental delay may not be reversible; they should be addressed with ophthalmologic evaluations and intervention, hearing aids or cochlear implants, and appropriate interventions for developmental deficits.
