WFS. Hearing loss is managed with either hearing aids or cochlear implant depending on the degree of hearing impairment and the frequencies affected.

Low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss (LFSNHL). Hearing aids should be tried early on, but may not be necessary until later in the disease course when a broader range of frequencies is involved. Hearing should be assessed throughout childhood in order to provide hearing aids when clinically indicated.
