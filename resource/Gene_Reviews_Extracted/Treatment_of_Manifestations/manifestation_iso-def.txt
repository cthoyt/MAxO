To date, no definitive treatment for ISOD has been identified. Symptomatic management by a multidisciplinary team consisting of specialists in neurology, nutrition, gastroenterology, pulmonary medicine, physiotherapy, and orthopedics is recommended. Management includes the following:

Appropriate medications for management of seizures and spasticity

Early consideration of gastrostomy tube placement to manage difficulties with swallowing to assure adequate caloric intake and reduce the risk of aspiration.

Appropriate management of vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and aspiration pneumonia

Chest physiotherapy to prevent respiratory complications

Sleep studies to assess nocturnal hypoventilation and institute appropriate interventions

Assessment for scoliosis

The following treatment modalities have been tried with minimal success:

Dietary. A low-protein diet restricted in cysteine and methionine has been tried in a few individuals with ISOD. Clinical and biochemical improvement were reported in two patients with late-onset ISOD [Del Rizzo et al 2013]. No clinical benefit has been noted in those with classic ISOD. The value of these diets in presymptomatic individuals has yet to be established.

Medical. No medical treatment that improves the neurologic outcome or prevents the development of neurologic manifestations in individuals with ISOD has been identified. The following agents have been tried on an experimental basis with minimal clinical effect:

Betaine has been used to increase the remethylation of homocysteine back to methionine, which reduces cysteine and leads to reduction in sulfite levels.

Thiamine replacement has been attempted (given that the accumulation of sulfite leads to depletion of thiamine).

Use of cysteamine and penicillamine (chelating agents used to chelate sulfite) resulted in no beneficial clinical effects.
