The affected individual is often managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes a neurologist, physiatrist, orthopedic surgeon, and physical and occupational therapists [Pareyson & Marchesi 2009, Reilly & Shy 2009, Rossor et al 2015].

Treatment is symptomatic and may include the following:

Special shoes, including those with good ankle support

Ankle/foot orthoses to correct foot drop and aid walking

Orthopedic surgery to correct severe pes cavus deformity [Guyton & Mann 2000, Ward et al 2008]

Forearm crutches or canes for gait stability; fewer than 5% of affected individuals need wheelchairs.

Exercise within the individual's capability to remain physically active
