Patient management guidelines have been published [Scarpa et al 2011].

At this time, treatment of complications in MPS II is symptomatic.

The involvement of specialists for each affected organ system is required to monitor and treat specific problems (see Clinical Description). Commonly required interventions include the following:

Shunting for hydrocephalus

Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy

Positive pressure ventilation (CPAP or tracheostomy)

Carpal tunnel release

Cardiac valve replacement

Inguinal hernia repair

Hip replacement

Developmental, occupational, and physical therapy are often necessary.

Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) (see Prevention of Primary Manifestations) has shown encouraging results in possibly modifying/correcting the non-CNS manifestations; as confirmed in a long-term study [Lampe et al 2014b].
