Management should involve a multidisciplinary team including specialists in hepatology, neurology, nutrition, clinical genetics, and child development. Treatment of MPV17-related hepatocerebral mtDNA depletion syndrome remains unsatisfactory with a mortality rate higher than 50% (see Clinical Description, Prognosis).

Nutritional support should be provided by a dietitian experienced in managing children with liver diseases.

Prevention of hypoglycemia requires frequent feeds and avoidance of fasting. Uncooked cornstarch (1-2 grams/kg/dose) can be used to manage hypoglycemia, and it may slow but not stop the progression of the liver disease [Spinazzola et al 2008, Parini et al 2009].

Liver transplantation. Although liver transplantation remains the only treatment option for liver failure, liver transplantation in mitochondrial hepatopathy is controversial, largely because of the multisystemic involvement. Liver transplantation has been performed in about one third of affected children; the outcome has not been satisfactory, with half of the transplanted children dying in the post-transplantation period because of multi-organ failure and/or sepsis (see Clinical Description, Prognosis).

Hepatocellular carcinoma. The two children reported with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were treated by liver transplantation. Screening for HCC using periodic hepatic ultrasound examination and serum alpha fetoprotein concentration potentially could result in earlier diagnosis, enabling liver transplantation before metastasis or local invasion occurs.
