Visual impairment. The general management of visual impairment is not specific to anophthalmia or microphthalmia (see Anophthalmia/Microphthalmia Overview). Care includes:

Early referral to an experienced multidisciplinary team

Consideration of use of expanders to stimulate growth of the orbit and periorbital tissues. Because accurate assessment of visual function is necessary, optically clear expanders should be used.

Referral to special educational services for visually impaired infants

Other

Referral to endocrinologist for growth or hypogonadism concerns

Referral to physiotherapist if any evidence of motor impairment exists

Referral to special educational services for neurodevelopmental problems as needed

Consideration of use of melatonin for regulation of circadian rhythm if sleep pattern is abnormal

Parent/caregiver training in seizure management
