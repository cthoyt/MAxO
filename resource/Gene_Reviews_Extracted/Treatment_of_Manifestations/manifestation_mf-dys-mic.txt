Mandibulofacial dysostosis

Neonates with airway compromise at delivery may require intubation and/or tracheostomy for initial stabilization.

Treatment of craniofacial manifestations is individualized and managed by a multidisciplinary team, which may include: oromaxillofacial surgery, plastic surgery, otolaryngology, dentistry/orthodontics, occupational and speech/language therapy.

Intellectual disability. Occupational, physical, and/or speech/language therapies are involved as needed to optimize developmental outcome.

Hearing loss. Treatment is individualized and may involve conventional hearing aid(s), bone-anchored hearing aid(s), and/or cochlear implant(s). See Hereditary Hearing Loss and Deafness Overview.

Esophageal atresia is managed as for nonsyndromic forms of EA, the definitive management being surgical. See Esophageal Atresia/Tracheoesophageal fistula Overview.

Cardiac defects are managed in a routine manner.

Thumb anomalies. Preaxial polydactyly, if present, may be treated surgically; other thumb anomalies are not generally functionally significant.

Short stature is managed expectantly. Of note, the response to human growth hormone has not been specifically reported.
