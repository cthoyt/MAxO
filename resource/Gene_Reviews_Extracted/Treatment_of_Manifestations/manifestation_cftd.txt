It is recommended that care be provided by a multidisciplinary team coordinated by a clinician familiar with treatment of neuromuscular conditions [North & Goebel 2003, North 2004]. Teams often include a pulmonologist, neurologist, physical therapist and/or rehabilitation medicine specialist, orthopedist, and clinical geneticist.

Hypotonia, weakness, and joint contractures may benefit from physical therapy, occupational therapy, and/or orthopedic intervention. Interventions may include exercise and stretching programs, orthotics or splinting, serial casting, or walking supports/wheelchairs [North 2004]. Regular low-impact exercise, stretching, and submaximal strength training may be helpful. These activities should be balanced with sufficient rest time to avoid exhaustion [North 2004].

Respiratory issues may benefit from breathing exercises, chest physiotherapy for handling secretions, seating assessment, immunization against influenza and other respiratory infections, antibiotics for chest infections, tracheostomy, or ventilatory support [North 2004].

Feeding and swallowing difficulties may benefit from speech therapy, diet supplementation, and feeding by gavage or gastrostomy. Gastrostomy and fundoplication should be considered if feeding issues continue beyond a few months of age [North 2004].

Referral to an orthopedist for evaluation of scoliosis and joint contractures is recommended. If scoliosis is present, serial x-rays can be used to define and monitor the degree of curve. The need for bracing or corrective (spinal fusion) surgery is based on the progression of the curve, the effect on pulmonary function, and the likelihood that surgery could affect motor function [North 2004].

Foot deformities may benefit from physical therapy, splinting/casting, or corrective surgery by an orthopedic surgeon [North 2004].

Cardiac involvement should be monitored by a cardiologist and treated as necessary [North 2004].

Orthodontic evaluation and appropriate intervention may be necessary.
