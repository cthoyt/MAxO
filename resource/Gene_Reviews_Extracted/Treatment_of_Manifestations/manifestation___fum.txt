Seizures in individuals with fumarate hydratase deficiency are often difficult to control. Individuals with seizures need to be evaluated and treated by a qualified specialist (usually a pediatric neurologist) in order to improve clinical outcome. Recommendation of particular medications or interventions is beyond the scope of this review. However, it should be noted that the ketogenic diet is usually considered to be contraindicated for treating epilepsy associated with fumarate hydratase deficiency or other enzymatic defects within the Krebâ€™s tricarboxylic acid cycle.

Nutritional intervention (e.g., feeding gastrostomy) may be appropriate in hypotonic and/or lethargic children with feeding difficulties and/or aspiration.

Physical therapy and orthopedic management is appropriate to minimize contractures and prevent scoliosis. Wheelchairs can be useful for some individuals.

In individuals with significant developmental deficits (including impairment of motor, language, and social development) special needs services are a required component of care.
