Psychosocial. Family and teachers are encouraged to relate to persons with BSyn appropriately for their chronologic age rather than the younger age suggested by their unusually small size.

Growth. Growth hormone administration to children with BSyn has not increased growth rate or adult height in most persons, but some have experienced improved linear growth. Use of growth hormone has been approached cautiously in this population, because of the theoretic increase in their risk to develop tumors as a result of their treatment. Supplemental feeding results in increased fat deposition but not in improved linear growth.

Diabetes mellitus. Treatment of diabetes mellitus in BSyn is the same as in other persons.

Cancer. The hypersensitivity of persons with BSyn to both DNA-damaging chemicals and ionizing radiation ordinarily necessitates modification of standard cancer treatment regimens, which usually includes a reduction of both dosages and durations. Absence of information as to the ideal dosages makes such treatment particularly challenging to the physician; nevertheless, the fact that the cancers themselves often appear unusually responsive to the treatment justifies the special effort.

Bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Too few persons with BSyn have had BMT to permit conclusions as to its value (which in theory could be great). The required ablative therapy prior to BMT often may require modification of standard protocols because of the hypersensitivity of persons with BSyn to DNA-damaging agents.
