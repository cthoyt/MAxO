Hyperuricemia/gout

Acute gout typically responds well to prednisone, short-term nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or colchicine.

Gout prevention with allopurinol or probenecid should be considered.

With allopurinol treatment, serum uric acid concentration returns to normal and gout attacks can be entirely prevented.

Lifelong therapy with allopurinol may be required.

In individuals with allergies or intolerance to allopurinol, febuxostat may be considered; however, no data on the use of this medication in UMOD-associated kidney disease are available at present.

Kidney disease. Referral to a nephrologist is indicated to monitor kidney function, evaluate for manifestations of chronic kidney disease, and prepare for renal replacement therapy when renal insufficiency occurs.

Renal replacement therapies such as hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis replace renal function but are associated with potential complications.

Kidney transplantation cures ADTKD-UMOD. The transplanted kidney does not develop the disease.

Allopurinol may slow the progression of kidney disease, although reliable data are not available [Pirson et al 2000, Fairbanks et al 2002].
