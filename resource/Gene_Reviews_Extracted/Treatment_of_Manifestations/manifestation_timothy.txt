Note: All medical procedures requiring anesthesia should be performed with caution (see Prevention of Secondary Complications).

Long QT interval

Beta-blockers. While most individuals with Timothy syndrome are treated with beta-blockers to maintain QT interval stability and thereby prevent ventricular tachyarrhythmia, no data concerning the effectiveness of beta-blockers are available. Verapamil and ranolazine have been reported effective in case reports. However, no cohort-based analysis of the efficacy of pharmacologic therapy is available.

Pacemaker. To control 2:1 AV block and resultant bradycardia, a pacemaker can be placed with general success within the first days of life.

Implants. The implantable cardioverter defibrillator is most important in preventing sudden cardiac death in individuals with Timothy syndrome. An implant should be considered in every individual with confirmed diagnosis as soon as body weight allows the procedure (as determined by the treating clinician).

Congenital heart defects. Standard treatment is indicated.

Respiratory infections. Standard treatment (antibiotic therapy, steroids) is indicated. The possibility of reduced immune response should be considered.

Surgical release of syndactyly. Standard treatment is indicated.
