A pediatric neurologist with expertise in the management of children with multiple disabilities and medically refractory epilepsy is recommended for long-term management.

Supportive management, including an individualized therapy plan that includes physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and vision therapy for oculomotor deficits and/or strabismus should begin at the time of diagnosis to ensure the best possible functionality and developmental outcome. Of note, it is appropriate to institute measures early on to manage potential complications of spasticity (i.e., joint contractures or reduced range of motion), which can increase the risk for decubitus ulcers as well as affect mobility and hygiene.

Failure to thrive in infants with the more severe brain malformations (i.e., lissencephaly, generalized polymicrogyria) is usually managed by nasogastric tube feedings, followed by gastrostomy tube placement as needed.

Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for seizures based on the specific epilepsy type are indicated. In general, seizures should be treated promptly by specialists, as poor seizure control frequently worsens feeding and increases both the likelihood that a gastrostomy tube will be needed and the risk for pneumonia.

Education of parents regarding common seizure presentations is appropriate. For information on non-medical interventions and coping strategies for parents or caregivers of children diagnosed with epilepsy, see Epilepsy & My Child Toolkit.

For those with CFEOM, see detailed discussion of nonsurgical and surgical treatment (including extraocular muscle and/or ptosis surgery) in Congenital Fibrosis of the Extraocular Muscles.

For patients with severe cortical malformations (lissencephalies, polymicrogyria-like cortical dysplasia, microlissencephaly), it is usually appropriate to discuss the level of care to be provided in the event of a severe intercurrent illness.
