Symptomatic individuals should be seen by a physical therapist and an orthopedist in order to assess the possibility of treatment (physiotherapy for muscular strengthening and maintaining mobility, cautious use of analgesic medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) and the optimal time for surgery (joint replacement), if indicated.

Career counseling is recommended.
