No specific management guidelines have been developed. Management is mostly supportive.

A multidisciplinary team of specialists in clinical genetics, plastic surgery, ophthalmology, pulmonology, gastroenterology, feeding, endocrinology, and neurology is recommended depending on the affected individualâ€™s manifestations.

Manifestation

Treatment

Considerations/Other

Lacrimal duct obstruction

Tear duct massage; consider lacrimal duct stent placement

Cleft palate, bifid uvula, or velopharyngeal insufficiency

Management by a cleft/craniofacial team; retrognathia & underdevelopment of the mandible may require mandibular distraction osteogenesis.

Obstructive sleep apnea

CPAP or BiPAP; ENT evaluation for tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy

Pulmonary consultation; consider treatment w/mefanamic or flufenamic acid (see Therapies Under Investigation)

Feeding difficulties or signs of aspiration

Use of a special nipple or bottle with cleft palate; short-term nasogastric feeding tube; consideration of gastrostomy tube

Gastroesophageal reflux disease

Standard positioning & pharmacologic treatment

Musculoskeletal findings (i.e., contractures, scoliosis)

Ankle-foot orthoses or other assistive devices; standard treatment for scoliosis

Physical therapy and/or occupational therapy evaluation; consultation w/an orthopedist

Seizure disorder

Evaluation of blood sugar & electrolytes; standard treatment for seizures

Consider EEG and referral to a neurologist

Unexplained hypoglycemia or suspected hyperinsulinism

Consideration of diazoxide therapy

Consider referral to an endocrinologist

Developmental delay

Early referral for developmental support/special education, which may include physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and/or cognitive therapy
