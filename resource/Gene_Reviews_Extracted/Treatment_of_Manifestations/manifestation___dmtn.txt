Rehydration and IV insulin on a sliding scale are usually required. Some infants produce some insulin and can be treated by rehydration alone.

Subcutaneous injection of insulin is introduced as soon as possible, often within two weeks. Continuous insulin pump therapy (as opposed to intermittent insulin injections) has been used successfully in a number of cases in the UK and France [JP Shield, personal communication]. Successful treatment with subcutaneous insulin glargine has also been reported [Barone et al 2011].

Blood glucose concentration should be monitored and insulin doses changed accordingly as in the standard treatment for diabetes mellitus. Insulin can be discontinued when blood glucose concentrations stabilize.

Once diabetes mellitus is in remission, parents need to be alerted to the possibility of recurrence of the diabetes mellitus, particularly during periods of illness. Symptoms such as excessive thirst, polyuria, and repeated bacterial infections should prompt measurement of blood glucose concentration.

If diabetes mellitus recurs, treatment may require diet alone, oral agents, or insulin, although the doses of insulin needed tend to be less than those required in type 1 diabetes mellitus (i.e., some residual endogenous insulin remains). It should be noted that patients do not always require treatment with insulin even in the neonatal period. In several patients at relapse, sulphonylureas or diet alone is adequate [Valerio et al 2004].

Note: Macroglossia could potentially cause airway obstruction; macroglossia severe enough to require treatment has not been reported.
