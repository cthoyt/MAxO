Consensus for management of congenital myopathies have been published [Wang et al 2012] (full text).

A multidisciplinary approach to the clinical management of the affected individual greatly improves quality of life and can influence survival:

Aggressive treatment of lower respiratory tract infections

Evaluation at an early stage of the need for intermittent or permanent use of a mechanical ventilator to prevent insidious nocturnal hypoxia

Assurance of adequate caloric intake and appropriate nutritional status, including special feeding techniques and high-calorie formulas and foods, if indicated

Standard treatment of gastroesophageal reflux, if present

Referral to an orthopedist for management of scoliosis and joint contractures, as in the general population

Physical therapy for maintenance/improvement of function and joint mobility

Speech therapy if dysarthria and/or hypernasal speech is present

Assessment of cardiac status because of the risk (albeit low) of cardiomyopathy or cor pulmonale
