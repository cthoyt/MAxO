Treatment for HPE varies according to the brain malformations and associated anomalies [Levey et al 2010]. Most affected children benefit from a multidisciplinary team approach with clinicians very familiar with HPE.

Hormone replacement therapy has been successful in some children with pituitary dysfunction.

Antiepileptic drugs can help decrease the frequency and intensity of seizures.

Feeding difficulties and failure to thrive may be managed with gastrostomy tube placement and Nissen fundoplication if gastroesophageal reflux and vomiting are issues. Thickening of feeds and upright positioning after feeding may be helpful to alleviate gastroesophageal reflux. To achieve the best growth in the child with HPE, the quality of the feeds is more important than the quantity.

Accommodations for oral feeding with cleft lip and/or palate may require specific nipples, cups, and parental training. Early surgical repair may improve feeding.

Placement of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt may be necessary in children with HPE and hydrocephalus.

In older children, surgical repair of cleft lip and/or palate may be indicated.

For children with cleft lip and/or palate, referral to a specialized cleft or craniofacial clinic is recommended.

Onset of new neurologic findings or deterioration warrant evaluation for seizures and/or hydrocephalus and/or shunt malfunction. Such evaluation would include vital sign monitoring, neurologic examination, EEG, and MRI.

A major aspect of treatment is support and counseling of the parents [Mercier et al 2010].
