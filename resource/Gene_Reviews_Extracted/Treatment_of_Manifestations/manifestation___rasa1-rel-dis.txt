Depending on the location and symptoms of AVMs/AVFs, a multi-disciplinary team including specialists in interventional radiology, neurosurgery, surgery, cardiology, and dermatology is recommended to determine appropriate approaches (e.g., embolization vs. surgery).

Cardiac overload. Referral to a cardiologist is indicated if cardiac overload is suspected.

Hemihyperplasia and/or leg length discrepancy. Referral to an orthopedist is recommended in individuals with hemihyperplasia and leg length discrepancy.
