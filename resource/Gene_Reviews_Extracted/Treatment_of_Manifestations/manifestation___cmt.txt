Reviews of treatment approaches to CMT are available [Carter et al 2008, Young et al 2008, Reilly & Shy 2009]. Reviews of the diagnosis, natural history and management are available [Pareyson & Marchesi 2009a, Pareyson & Marchesi 2009b].

Treatment is symptomatic. Affected individuals are often evaluated and managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes neurologists, physiatrists, orthopedic surgeons, and physical and occupational therapists [Carter et al 2004, Grandis & Shy 2005]. Quality of life has been measured and compared among various groups of individuals with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) [Vinci et al 2005a, Burns et al 2010]. Persistent weakness of the hands and/or feet has important career and employment implications; anticipatory counseling is appropriate.

Special shoes, including those with good ankle support, may be needed. Affected individuals often require ankle/foot orthoses (AFOs) to correct foot drop and aid walking.

Some individuals require forearm crutches or canes for gait stability; fewer than 5% of individuals need wheelchairs.

Exercise is encouraged within the individual's capability and many individuals remain physically active.

Orthopedic surgery may be required to correct severe pes cavus deformity [Guyton & Mann 2000, Guyton 2006, Casasnovas et al 2008, Ward et al 2008]. Surgery is sometimes required for hip dysplasia [Chan et al 2006].

The cause of any pain should be identified as accurately as possible [Padua et al 2006].

Musculoskeletal pain may respond to acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents [Carter et al 1998].

Neuropathic pain may respond to tricyclic antidepressants or drugs such as carbamazepine or gabapentin.

Modafinil has been used to treat fatigue [Carter et al 2006].
