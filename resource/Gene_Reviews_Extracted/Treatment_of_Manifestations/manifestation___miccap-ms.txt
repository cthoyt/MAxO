Development. As for all children with profound developmental disability, infants and children with MIC-CAP syndrome require stimulation and recreation. Given that most have poor vision, regular tactile and auditory stimulation are recommended.

Physical habilitation. Central hypotonia and peripheral hypertonia require care by physicians and therapists specializing in physical habilitation. If the child is non-ambulatory, proper seating and bracing is required to maintain posture and prevent contractures.

Neurologic. Seizure management during infancy requires an experienced pediatric neurology team to manage medically refractory epilepsy. Multiple anticonvulsant medications are frequently required for adequate seizure control. A few individuals have responded favorably to ketogenic diet or corticosteroids.

Other. Standard care for other medical issues (e.g., enteral feeding team to optimize nutrition and weight gain)
