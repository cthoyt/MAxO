Because of the rarity of Majeed syndrome, treatment is empiric.

CRMO is treated as follows:

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which provide moderate improvement. If there is an inadequate response to NSAIDs, corticosteroids are useful in controlling CRMO and skin manifestations; however, their long-term use in children is limited by side effects such as growth delay and cataracts.

Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors and bisphosphonates have been reported to improve sporadic CRMO; however, the two individuals with Majeed syndrome treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors did not improve [Herlin et al 2013]. To date, bisphosphonates have not been used to treat individuals with Majeed syndrome; thus, their efficacy in this disorder is unknown.

The same two affected individuals reported by Herlin et al who failed to improve with TNF blockade did respond to IL-1 blockade (IL-1 receptor antagonist [anakinra] and IL-1Î² antibody [canakinumab]) with clinical, radiographic, and laboratory evidence of improvement [Herlin et al 2013].

Physical therapy to avoid disuse atrophy of muscles or contractures

CDA is treated with periodic monitoring with complete blood count (CBC) and blood transfusion if indicated. One patient had a splenectomy, after which the anemia markedly improved. In the two affected individuals reported by Herlin et al [2013] it is unclear if the CDA completely resolved, as a repeat bone marrow biopsy was not performed.
