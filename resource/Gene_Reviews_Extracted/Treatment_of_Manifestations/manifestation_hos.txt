The management of individuals with HOS optimally involves a multidisciplinary team approach with specialists in medical genetics, cardiology, and orthopedics, including a specialist in hand surgery.

A cardiologist can assist in determining the need for antiarrhythmic medications and surgery. Individuals with severe heart block may require pacemaker implantation. Pharmacologic treatment for affected individuals with pulmonary hypertension may be appropriate. Individuals with pulmonary hypertension and/or structural heart malformation may require tertiary care center cardiology follow up. Cardiac surgery, if required for congenital heart defect, is standard.

The orthopedic team may be able to guide individuals in decisions regarding surgery for improved upper-limb and hand function as well as physical and occupational therapy options. Those individuals born with severe upper-limb malformations may be candidates for surgery to improve function, such as pollicization (creation of a thumb-like digit by moving another digit into the thenar position) in the case of thumb aplasia/hypoplasia [Vaienti et al 2009]. Children with severe limb shortening may benefit from prostheses as well as from physical and occupational therapy.

Individuals and families are also likely to benefit from programs providing social support to those with limb anomalies.
