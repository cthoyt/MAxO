Cognitive impairment. Developmental stimulation including speech therapy is appropriate.

Note: Because developmental outcome is variable, individual counseling is important.

Spastic paraplegia. Treatment is nonspecific; general guidelines can be followed.

Epilepsy. Seizures usually respond well to standard therapy with antiepileptic drugs; however, in some males seizures are resistant to the usual therapy, necessitating multi-drug therapy.

Predisposition to infections. Infections, especially of the respiratory tract, should be treated immediately with appropriate antibiotics. All vaccines should be given. If aspiration occurs, placement of a permanent gastrostomy should be considered.

Gastrointestinal dysfunction. Feeding problems, gastroesophageal reflux, swallowing dysfunction, and obstipation require referral and treatment in the usual manner.
