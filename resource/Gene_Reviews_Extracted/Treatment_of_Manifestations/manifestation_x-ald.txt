When adrenal insufficiency is identified in an affected male, corticosteroid replacement therapy is essential and can be lifesaving. (Corticosteroid replacement therapy has no effect on nervous system involvement.)

Affected boys benefit from the general supportive care of parents, as well as psychological and educational support.

Physical therapy, management of urologic complications, and family and vocational counseling are of value for men with adrenomyeloneuropathy, many of whom maintain successful personal and professional lives [Silveri et al 2004].
