The predominant management issues are ultimate adult stature and growth:

Surgical bone lengthening may be an option for some.

Adaptive aids for people with short stature are appropriate. Significant joint laxity should prompt orthopedic evaluation and measures to control the development of arthritis. Males with 3-M syndrome should be referred for endocrinologic evaluation regarding gonadal function at puberty.

Treatment with growth hormone is indicated in the presence of documented growth hormone deficiency, but treatment of children with normal serum concentration of growth hormone is experimental. GH treatment should be carried out in a center with experience in managing growth disorders.

Note: (1) Although most children with 3-M syndrome are evaluated for growth hormone deficiency, only one individual has been reported with an incomplete response to growth hormone (GH) stimulation, suggesting partial deficiency of GH [Miller et al 1975]. (2) Several individuals with short stature have been treated with exogenous GH without positive result [Miller et al 1975]. One report suggested that high-dosage GH treatment may be effective in 3-M syndrome [van der Wal et al 2001]. No obvious demonstration of growth hormone efficiency has been published to date [Huber et al 2011].

Hip dislocation has been reported, probably secondary to joint laxity [Badina et al 2011, Huber et al 2011].
