Of primary importance in the management of individuals with HHH syndrome is rapid control of the hyperammonemic episodes that may result from changes in diet (e.g., protein intake), infection, fasting, or injury, or have no apparent cause. Long-term management of affected individuals focuses on the prevention of episodes of hyperammonemia and attempts to lower the level of plasma ornithine concentration.

It is critical that the acute and long-term management of individuals with HHH syndrome be performed in conjunction with a metabolic specialist.

Treatment of acute hyperammonemic episodes. Assess plasma ammonia concentration, complete chemistry panel, arterial blood gases (ABGs), CBC and differential (to evaluate for an infectious process), urinalysis, urine and plasma amino acids, and urine orotic acid.

Plasma ammonia concentrations ≥100-125 μmol/L (~2 times control values) should be treated immediately.

Discontinue all oral intake until the patient’s condition is stabilized because vomiting may be induced by hyperammonemia and/or some of the drugs given intravenously to promote ammonia removal (e.g., as part of nitrogen scavenging therapy). This approach also stops all protein intake.

Initial intravenous infusion should be 10% dextrose (with 1/4 normal saline and 20mEq/liter KCl) at twice maintenance; ammonia and glucose/Na/K/Cl/CO2 concentrations should be monitored every two hours or when neurologic status changes. It is important to note that patients respond neurologically differently to rising ammonia concentrations: an individual with HHH syndrome is more likely to respond to the initial IV infusion of dextrose and to normalize his/her plasma ammonia concentration when compared to an individual with a urea cycle disorder such as OTC deficiency or ASS deficiency. If clinical status does not improve, infusion of supplemental arginine and ammonia removal drugs is added to the regimen.

Follow published protocols for treatment of acute hyperammonemic episodes similar to those instituted for OTC deficiency [Brusilow & Horwich 2001]. These protocols consist of arginine supplementation and use of intravenous bolus and maintenance infusions of the ammonia removal drugs sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate. The New England Consortium of Metabolic Programs has a complete set of treatment protocols and algorithms that are freely available and easily accessible.

An initial priming dose of arginine, benzoate, and phenylacetate is given (see Table 3).

Mix solutions of arginine, benzoate, and phenylacetate in a 10% dextrose solution at a dose of 25 mL of 10% dextrose/kg and infuse over 90 min. The solutions containing arginine, benzoate, and phenylacetate should be given in conjunction with 10% dextrose + one quarter normal saline + 20 mEq/L KCL solution.

Initial Priming Dose of Arginine, Benzoate, and Phenylacetate by Age Group

Mix solutions of arginine, benzoate, and phenylacetate in a 10% dextrose solution at a dose of 25 mL of 10% dextrose/kg and infuse over 90 min. The solutions containing arginine, benzoate, and phenylacetate should be given in conjunction with 10% dextrose + one quarter normal saline + 20 mEq/L KCL solution.

If ammonia levels stabilize, the same arginine, benzoate, and phenylacetate solution is infused over 24 hrs.

Note: All preparations of arginine and ammonia removal drugs should be double- or triple-checked given the potential for drug intoxication if high doses are given or continued CNS ammonia toxicity if low doses are given. If sodium benzoate or sodium phenylacetate solutions are not available, infusion of arginine should be started.

Hemodialysis. If the patient fails to respond to the above treatment of hyperammonemia, if the plasma ammonia concentration increases, and/or if the neurologic status deteriorates, hemodialysis should be started promptly to remove ammonia from the circulation. Infusion of arginine, benzoate, and phenylacetate should continue during hemodialysis.

Dialysis may be prolonged if the catabolic state persists.

Nutrition. Twenty-four to 36 hours after initial admission the patient should start receiving intravenous alimentation including daily doses of only essential amino acids, carnitine, vitamins, and lipids to help avoid a catabolic state which will prolong hyperammonemia. Note: Non-essential amino acids (i.e., glutamine, proline, and glycine) should be avoided since they increase the nitrogen load to an already compromised urea cycle.
