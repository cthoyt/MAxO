Infertility. No available treatment can reverse the morphologic and/or motility defects observed in CATSPER-related asthenospermia or asthenoteratospermia (low motility with increased number of abnormal forms). For infertile males, one option is to bypass these morphologic and motility abnormalities using assisted reproductive technologies such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) [Smith et al 2013]. This approach has been used successfully in males with DIS [Zhang et al 2007].

Deafness. For males and females with DIS, treatment of hearing loss is best achieved by fitting hearing aids for amplification. For school-age children or adolescents, special educational assistance may also be warranted and, where possible, should be offered. (See Deafness and Hereditary Hearing Loss Overview and Related Genetic Counseling Issues for other issues pertinent to the care of deaf and hard-of-hearing persons.)
