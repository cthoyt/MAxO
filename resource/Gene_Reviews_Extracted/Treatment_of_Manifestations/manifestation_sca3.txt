Management of individuals with SCA3 remains supportive as no medication has been proven to slow the course of disease [D’Abreu et al 2010].

However, some symptoms may respond –in some cases dramatically – to certain drugs:

In particular, the extrapyramidal syndromes resembling parkinsonism may benefit from levodopa or dopamine agonist [Subramony et al 1993, Nandagopal & Moorthy 2004].

Symptoms of restless legs syndrome may respond to these agents.

Other manifestations, including spasticity, drooling, and sleep problems, also respond variably to appropriate agents such as lioresal, atropine-like drugs, and hypnotic agents.

Botulinum toxin has been used for dystonia and spasticity [Freeman & Wszolek 2005].

Daytime fatigue, a common problem in individuals with SCA3, may respond to psychostimulants used in narcolepsy such as modafinil.

Depression is common in individuals with SCA3 and should be treated with antidepressants [Cecchin et al 2007]. A trial of occupational therapy in SCA3 showed that depression scores improved as a consequence of therapy, underscoring the fact that non-pharmacologic measures may also improve affective disorder in SCA3 [Silva et al 2010].

Non-pharmacologic therapy is important in SCA3:

Although neither exercise nor physical therapy slows the progression of incoordination or muscle weakness, affected individuals should maintain activity. Canes and walkers help prevent falling, and motorized scooters later in disease can help maintain independence. Intensive coordinative training or a course of combined physical and occupational therapy focused on gait and incoordination can lead to symptomatic improvement [Ilg et al 2009, Miyai et al 2012]

Speech therapy and communication devices such as writing pads and computer-based devices may benefit those with dysarthria.

When dysphagia becomes troublesome, video esophagrams can identify the consistency of food least likely to trigger aspiration.

Modification of the home with such conveniences as grab bars, raised toilet seats, and ramps to accommodate motorized chairs may be necessary.

Weighted eating utensils and dressing hooks help maintain a sense of independence.
