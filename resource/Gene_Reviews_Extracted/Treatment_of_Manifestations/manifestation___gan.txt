Treatment, focused on managing the clinical findings, often involves a team including (pediatric) neurologists, orthopedic surgeons, physiotherapists, psychologists, and speech and occupational therapists. Major goals are to optimize intellectual and physical development and, later in life, to slow the inevitable deterioration of these capacities.

Note: Early intellectual development is nearly normal in many affected children, enabling them to attend a normal school initially; however, significant intellectual impairment usually occurs before the second decade of life.

Treatment includes the following:

Speech and occupational therapy to improve communication and activities of daily living

Early intervention and special education directed to the individual's disability. Frequent reassessment is needed because of the progressive nature of the disorder. Special education often becomes necessary between ages five and 12 years.

Physiotherapy (typically for distal weakness, ataxia, and spasticity) to preserve mobility as long as possible

Orthopedic surgery as required for foot deformities (Note, however, that most affected individuals become wheelchair bound between ages ten and 20 years for other reasons.)

Appropriate ophthalmologic treatment (e.g., surgery or glasses), especially if diplopia occurs
