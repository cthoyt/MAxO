Children who develop neuroblastic tumors (neuroblastomas, ganglioneuroblastoma, or ganglioneuroma) should be evaluated and treated by a pediatric oncologist at a pediatric cancer center.

Neuroblastoma and ganglioneuroblastoma. The treatment for individuals with a neuroblastic tumor who have a germline ALK activating pathogenic variant is the same standard risk-stratified therapy used to treat all neuroblastic tumors. Clinical trials are ongoing to study the efficacy of ALK-targeted therapy in the setting of relapsed and refractory neuroblastoma and ganglioneuroblastoma (see Therapies Under Investigation).

The management guidelines for neuroblastoma or ganglioneuroblastoma are complex [Irwin & Park 2015]

Depending on the age of the affected individual, stage of the tumor, and biologic characteristics of the tumor, treatment may involve observation or surgical resection.

Tumors with risk for metastatic spread or those that have already metastasized require chemotherapy and sometimes radiation therapy, stem cell transplantation, and immunotherapy.

Ganglioneuromas are typically removed by surgical resection and require no further therapy.
