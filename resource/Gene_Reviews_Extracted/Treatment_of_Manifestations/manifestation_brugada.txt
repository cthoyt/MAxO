Brugada syndrome is characterized by the presence of ST-segment elevation in leads V1 to V3. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are the only therapy currently known to be effective in persons with Brugada syndrome with syncope or cardiac arrest [Brugada et al 1999, Wilde et al 2002]. See Figure 3 for risk stratification and recommendations of ICD in individuals with Brugada syndrome.

Electrical storms respond well to infusion of isoproterenol (1-3 µg/min), the first line of therapy before other antiarrhythmics [Maury et al 2004].

It is important to:

Eliminate/treat agents/circumstances such as fever, cocaine use, electrolyte disturbances, and use of class I antiarrhythmic medications and other non-cardiac medications that can induce acute arrhythmias;

AND

Hospitalize the patient at least until the ECG pattern has normalized.

Controversy exists regarding the treatment of asymptomatic individuals. Recommendations vary [Benito et al 2009, Escárcega et al 2009, Nunn et al 2010] and include the following:

Observation until the first symptom develops (the first symptom can also be sudden cardiac death)

Placement of an ICD if the family history is positive for sudden cardiac death

Use of electrophysiologic study (EPS) to identify those most likely to experience arrhythmias and thus to benefit the most from placement of an ICD
