There is no definite treatment for FCMD. Multidisciplinary and appropriate management can prolong survival and improve the quality of life for individuals with FCMD.

Treatment includes the following:

Physical therapy and stretching exercises to promote mobility and prevent contractures

Monitoring for orthopedic complications such as foot deformity and scoliosis. When scoliosis is present, spinal fusion can preserve breathing function and improve sitting balance [Takaso et al 2010]

Use of mechanical assistance such as long leg braces to maintain standing posture and wheelchairs to help mobility

Use of respiratory aids such as nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilator when indicated

Note: Noninvasive ventilation is offered, particularly at night, before respiratory distress becomes acute.

Prompt treatment of acute respiratory tract infections; particularly important, as these infections are the most common cause of hospital admissions and death in people with FCMD

Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) when indicated

Surgical treatment for gastroesophageal reflux when indicated

Gastrostomy when indicated to assure adequate caloric intake

Routine therapy of cardiomyopathy
