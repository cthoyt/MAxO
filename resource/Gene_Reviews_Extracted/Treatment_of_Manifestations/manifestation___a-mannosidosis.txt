Some affected individuals, including those who have had bone marrow transplantation (BMT), may require symptomatic treatment. The overall aim is to prevent complications and to optimize quality of life.

Medical measures

Early use of antibiotics for bacterial infections. A clinical consequence of the immunodeficiency is that bacterial and viral infections must be treated with vigilance.

Hearing aids as early as possible for individuals with sensorineural hearing loss to improve hearing and enhance speech development and social functioning

Insertion

of PE (pressure-equalizing) tubes to reduce the conductive/mechanical component of hearing loss from fluid in the middle ear

Glasses (spectacles) to correct refractive error to improve vision. Although lens replacement for cataract is a standard procedure in alpha-mannosidosis, corneal transplantation can be difficult; postoperative complications include astigmatism (which may be correctable with repeat surgery, laser treatment, or optical devices).

Physiotherapy including hydrotherapy to avoid strain on the joints

Use of a wheelchair if necessary

Treatment of osteoporosis or osteopenia identified on bone densitometry with palmidronate (Aredia®) monthly or zoledronic acid (Aclasta®) once a year

Orthopedic intervention if necessary. Special shoes may help with ankle and foot support.

Ventriculocaval shunt for communicating hydrocephalusNote: Ventriculoperitoneal shunts may cause ascites because of the reduced absorptive capacity of the peritoneal cavity [Malm, personal communication]. Therefore, ventriculocaval shunts are preferred.

Educational opportunities/social considerations

Use of sign language in individuals with significant hearing loss

Early educational intervention for development of social skills

Speech therapy to improve speech

Special education to maximize learning

Planning housing for possible future wheelchair use
