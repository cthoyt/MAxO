Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have a major effect against generalized seizures, sometimes controlling seizures for many months. Generalized seizures are rare in individuals who are treated, even years after disease onset.

Valproic acid is the traditional antiepileptic treatment for LD; because it is a broad-spectrum AED, it controls both the generalized tonic-clonic seizures and myoclonic jerks.

Clonazepam can be used as an adjunctive medication for control of myoclonus, as in other forms of PME, although the literature does not provide clear evidence for its effect on myoclonus in LD.

Zonisamide has had a significant effect on both seizures and myoclonus in a small number of individuals with Unverricht-Lundborg disease and Lafora disease.

Both piracetam and levetiracetam have been effective, sustained, and well tolerated as add-on treatment for myoclonus in progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME) [Koskiniemi et al 1998, Genton et al 1999, Fedi et al 2001, Crest et al 2004]. Levetiracetam had a significant effect on myoclonus in two sisters with LD [Boccella et al 2003]. Lohi et al [2006] reported that levetiracetam exacerbated seizures while improving myoclonus in two persons with LD.
