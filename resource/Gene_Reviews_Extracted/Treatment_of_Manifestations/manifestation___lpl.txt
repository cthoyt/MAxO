Medical nutrition therapy. Morbidity and mortality can be prevented by maintaining plasma triglyceride concentration at less than 2000 mg/dL; a good clinical goal is less than 1000 mg/dL [Viljoen & Wierzbicki 2012]. Restriction of dietary fat to no more than 20 g/day or 15% of total energy intake is usually sufficient to reduce plasma triglyceride concentration and to keep the individual with familial LPL deficiency free of symptoms.

Medium-chain triglycerides may be used for cooking, as they are absorbed directly into the portal vein without becoming incorporated into chylomicron triglyceride.

The success of therapy depends on the individual's acceptance of the fat restriction, including both unsaturated and saturated fat. Note: Fish oil supplements, which are effective in disorders of excess hepatic triglyceride production, are not effective in LPL deficiency and are contraindicated (see Agents/Circumstances to Avoid).

The enlarged liver and spleen can return to normal size within one week of lowering of triglyceride concentrations.

The xanthomas can clear over the course of weeks to months. Recurrent or persistent eruptive xanthomas indicate inadequate therapy.

Pancreatitis associated with the chylomicronemia syndrome is treated in the manner typical for other forms of pancreatitis.

Discontinuation of oral fat intake stops chylomicron triglyceride formation, and replacement with hypocaloric parenteral nutrition decreases VLDL triglyceride production.

Administration of excess calories, as in hyperalimentation, is contraindicated in the acute state. The intravenous administration of lipid emulsions may lead to persistent or recurrent pancreatitis.

If recurrent pancreatitis with severe hypertriglyceridemia occurs, total dietary fat intake needs to be reduced.
