A multidisciplinary team evaluation is recommended beginning in early infancy to evaluate motor and speech development and later to assist in referrals for appropriate educational programs.

Supportive care may include the following:

Occupational and physical therapy

Alternative and augmentative communication

Behavioral therapy (e.g., applied behavioral analysis therapy)

Psychotropic medications for behavioral manifestations

Standard management for seizures including medications, vagus nerve stimulators, and/or ketogenic diets [Conant et al 2014]. Effectiveness of antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment varies by seizure type and severity. No prospective or randomized-controlled data on AED therapy in dup15q have been published. See Conant et al [2014] for parent-reported effectiveness of various medications and treatments.

Seizure management is important in preventing secondary complications, including (in the most severe cases) brain damage, developmental regression, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) [Devinsky 2011].

Approximately half of seizure-related deaths are not due to SUDEP, but to other causes including status epilepticus, drowning, falls, and accidents. Many of these are preventable. For example, status epilepticus may be prevented with the use of rescue medications such as rectal diazepam or nasal midazolam. Some evidence suggests that prompt identification of a seizure and basic care (e.g., repositioning a person on the side instead of face down) after a seizure may help prevent SUDEP [Ryvlin et al 2013]. However, the only known preventive therapy is the best possible seizure control [Ryvlin et al 2011]. Although a variety of monitors can help detect SUDEP (e.g., wrist and mattress accelerometers), none can prevent it [Devinsky 2011].

Caregivers. For information on non-medical interventions and coping strategies for parents or caregivers of children diagnosed with epilepsy, see Epilepsy & My Child Toolkit (pdf).
