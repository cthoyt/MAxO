The most important aspect of treating symptomatic patients is reversal of catabolism and sustained anabolism by provision of simple carbohydrates by mouth (for example, glucose tablets, or sweetened, non-diet beverages) or IV if the patient is unable or unlikely to maintain or achieve anabolism through oral intake of food and fluids. IV administration of glucose should then be initiated immediately with a bolus of 2 mL/kg 25% dextrose, followed by 10% dextrose with appropriate electrolytes at a rate of 10-12 mg glucose/kg/minute and to achieve/maintain a blood glucose level higher than 5 mmol/L [Saudubray et al 1999].

All affected individuals should have a frequently updated "emergency" letter to be given, if needed, to health care providers who may not be familiar with MCAD deficiency. This letter should include a detailed explanation of the management of acute metabolic decompensation, emphasizing the importance of preventive measures (e.g., intravenous glucose regardless of "normal" laboratory results, overnight in-hospital observation), and the telephone numbers of the individual's metabolic specialist.
