Therapy is aimed at controlling symptoms that may cause discomfort.

If present, seizures may be treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) such as diphenylhydantoin or carbamazepine.

Myoclonus can sometimes be mitigated by clonazepam.

Issues related to dysphagia are often difficult to resolve. Since the disease is terminal, families are often faced with the decision of whether or not to place a permanent feeding tube. The timing of this decision differs depending on the type of prion disease. In general, placement of a feeding tube should be discouraged in those with late-developing dysphagia, as it may make it difficult for families to eventually withdraw feeding.

Evaluation by a social worker is mandatory to assist the family in management planning, as many decisions are required during the course of disease and at the end of the disease process. Autopsy to confirm the diagnosis should always be a consideration, as accurate information is important for family members.
