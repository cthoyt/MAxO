Appropriate treatment includes the following:

ICU care during acute encephalopathic episode, including treatment of seizures and increased intracranial pressure

Biotin and thiamine therapy. Biotin is given as 5-10 mg /kg and thiamine as 300-900 mg orally. (Note: In one report 20mg/kg/day in a neonate was used.)

Symptoms typically resolve within days. (Note: SLC19A3 encodes a second thiamine transport and some patients respond only to thiamine.)

Biotin and thiamine need to be given lifelong.

During acute decompensation thiamine may be increased to double the regular dose and given intravenously.

In the acute stage empiric treatment with antimicrobial/antiviral agents. Recommended until infectious causes of the acute/subacute encephalopathy are ruled out.

Fever control. Paramount as fever downregulates SLC19A3 and may exacerbate the disease.

Antiepileptic drugs for effective control of seizures

Symptomatic treatment of dystonia, including administration of L-dopa

Rehabilitation, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy

Educational programs adapted to individual needs

Education of the family regarding the importance of lifelong compliance with medical therapy
