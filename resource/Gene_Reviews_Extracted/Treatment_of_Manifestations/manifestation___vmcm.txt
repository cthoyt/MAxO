Management depends largely on the size and location of the lesions. Treatment is required for any symptomatic VMCM lesion. Although sclerotherapy is the treatment of choice, sclerosing agents are not specific and can lead to ulceration if the VMCM is mucosal or involves the epidermis [Hammer et al 2001, Dompmartin et al 2010, Boon et al 2011]. Foam aethoxysclerol and bleomycin are preferentially used as sclerosing agents. Surgery gives a consistently better result if it is performed after sclerotherapy.

If lesions are painful and D-dimers are elevated, low molecular-weight heparin can be used to alleviate pain [Dompmartin et al 2008].
