For ALS-related treatment options refer to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Overview.

Psychosocial support and education are indicated to reduce caregiver stress and reduce the risk of caregiver burden.

Non-pharmacologic treatment options in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) include psychosocial support and education as well as environmental, behavioral, and physical interventions designed to minimize the occurrence and consequences of undesired behaviors. Caregiver and patient support groups are valuable.

Additional helpful interventions include physical, occupational and speech therapy, home safety evaluations, and the implementation of augmentative communication devices [Rabinovici & Miller 2010].

Physical, occupational, and speech therapy are very valuable in cases involving parkinsonism and/or lower/upper motor neuron signs.

Pharmacologic treatment should be considered when non-pharmacologic treatment options have failed or when behavioral and psychological signs and symptoms (as in FTLD) are dangerous or too stressful. Options include:

SSRIs. Although the reported efficacy of SSRIs in treating FTLD is based on relatively small, often uncontrolled trials, the use of SSRIs is considered first line therapy in FTLD with behavioral and psychological signs and symptoms [Rabinovici & Miller 2010].

Venlafaxine. When apathy is prominent, venlafaxine may be tried for its activating properties.

Bupropion is considered when parkinsonism is present because of its dopaminergic tone [Rabinovici & Miller 2010].

Atypical antipsychotics may be considered in patients with severe behavioral and psychological signs and symptoms (agitation, aggressiveness, psychosis) that are refractory to SSRIs. Often, atypical antipsychotics are necessary only as a temporizing measure, and can be tapered as patients become more apathetic (and thus less agitated and disinhibited) with disease progression [Rabinovici & Miller 2010].
