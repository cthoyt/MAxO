The treatments for BAP1-TPDS tumors are those used in standard practice.

Uveal melanoma. Because of the increased aggressiveness of BAP1-related uveal melanoma, all uveal melanomas should be managed as the more aggressive tumors (ie., those determined to be class 2 by expression profiling and those with monosomy 3) [Njauw et al 2012].

Malignant mesothelioma. MMe is highly refractory to conventional therapies including aggressive surgical intervention and multimodality strategies; thus, a cure is unlikely.

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma is treated in the usual manner.
