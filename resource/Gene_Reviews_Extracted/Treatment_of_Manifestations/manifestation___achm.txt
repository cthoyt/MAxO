Dark or special filter glasses or red-tinted contact lenses reduce photophobia and may improve visual acuity.

Low vision aids include high-powered magnifiers for reading.

Children with achromatopsia should have preferential seating in the front of the class to benefit maximally from their magnifying devices.

Extensive information about learning and occupational aids is available from the Achromatopsia Network (www.achromat.org).
