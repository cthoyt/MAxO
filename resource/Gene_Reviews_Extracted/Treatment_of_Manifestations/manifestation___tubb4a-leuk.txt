Although there is no curative treatment for TUBB4A-related leukodystrophies, quality of life can be improved in the following ways.

Spasticity that is functionally disabling can lead to joint contractures and scoliosis; both require physical therapy (stretching and positioning) and medical management. Oral GABA agonists such as baclofen and diazepam can be used. In some instances intrathecal baclofen pumps can be considered. For focal spasticity, intramuscular botulinum toxin may be helpful.

Dystonia can be managed with:

Baclofen or intramuscular botulinum toxin when associated with spasticity;

Trihexyphenidyl or tetrabenazine;

High doses of levodopa and carbidopa [Wakusawa et al 2006, Tonduti et al 2016].

When dystonia is refractory to medical management, a baclofen pump may be considered. Of note, to date deep brain stimulation has not been studied in TUBB4A-related leukodystrophy.

Swallowing dysfunction may result in use of a gastrostomy for feeding to reduce the risk of aspiration.

Dysarthria may warrant augmentative communication tools.

Anticonvulsant medications should be used when seizures are present.

Constipation, commonly due to neurologic dysfunction and poor intestinal motility, can be treated with diet, laxatives, and stool softeners.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease is common and should be considered in the evaluation of pain.

Functional ability can be improved by use of walkers or wheeled mobility devices and other necessary equipment.

Accommodations in school such as an individual educational plan are often needed. With such accommodations many children with the classic H-ABC phenotype perform at or near grade level for many years, although cognitive decline may be seen later.

Family support and advocacy groups can provide needed psychosocial support for affected individuals.
