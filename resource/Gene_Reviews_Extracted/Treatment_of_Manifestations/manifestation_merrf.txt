The seizure disorder can be treated with conventional anticonvulsant therapy. No controlled studies have compared the efficacy of different anticonvulsants. Levetiracetam, clonazepam, zonisamide, and valproic acid (VPA) have been used to treat myoclonic epilepsy; however, VPA may cause secondary carnitine deficiency and should be avoided or used with L-carnitine supplementation.

The myoclonus improved substantially in three of four individuals treated with levetiracetam [Crest et al 2004, Mancuso et al 2007]. Clonazepam can also reduce myoclonus.

Physical therapy is helpful for any impaired motor abilities.

Aerobic exercise is helpful in MERRF and other mitochondrial diseases [Taivassalo & Haller 2004].

Standard pharmacologic therapy is used to treat cardiac symptoms.
