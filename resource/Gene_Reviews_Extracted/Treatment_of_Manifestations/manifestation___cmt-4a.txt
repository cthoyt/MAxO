Individuals with GDAP1-HMSN are often evaluated and managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes neurologists, physiatrists, orthopedic surgeons, and physical and occupational therapists [Corrado et al 2016, McCorquodale et al 2016]. Treatment is symptomatic and may include the following [Mathis et al [2015]:

Daily heel cord stretching exercises to prevent Achilles tendon shortening.

Exercise within the affected individual's capability

Note: (1) Fatigue may improve with exercise; (2) unconfirmed anecdotal observations suggest benefit from the stimulant modafinil [Carter et al 2006, Ramdharry et al 2012].

Ankle/foot orthoses (AFOs) to correct foot drop and aid walking [Guillebastre et al 2011, Phillips et al 2012]

Orthopedic surgery to correct severe pes cavus deformity [Boffeli & Tabatt 2015, Faldini et al 2015, Ferraro et al 2017]

Forearm crutches or canes for gait stability

Wheelchair for mobility because of gait instability

Treatment of musculoskeletal pain with acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) [Kroenke et al 2009]

Treatment of neuropathic pain with tricyclic antidepressants or drugs such as carbamazepine or gabapentin [Shy 2006, Bril et al 2011, Ribiere et al 2012, Jeong et al 2013]

Weight control to avoid obesity, which has a negative effect on gait and balance

Career and employment counseling because of persistent weakness of hands and/or feet

Individual psychotherapy, group therapy, and/or antidepressant medication for depression [Cordeiro et al 2014]

Treatment may require involvement of specialists to evaluate and manage potential complications, including the following:

Lower urinary tract involvement [Krhut et al 2014]

Obstructive sleep apnea and restless legs [Boentert et al 2014]

Pulmonary compromise and/or phrenic nerve involvement [Aboussouan et al 2007]

Vocal cord paresis

Hip dysplasia [Bamford et al 2009, Novais et al 2014]

Note: No special diet (including supplements with essential fatty acids, vitamin E, or creatine) has been shown to be beneficial [Mathis et al 2015].
