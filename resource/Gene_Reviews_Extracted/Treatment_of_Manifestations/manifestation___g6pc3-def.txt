Neutropenia. Treatment with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) improves neutrophil numbers, reduces the number of infections, and improves the quality of life [Boztug et al 2009, McDermott et al 2010, Boztug et al 2012]. Of note, the dose required to keep absolute neutrophil counts above 0.5x109/L can vary greatly among patients. In some patients G-CSF -- even in large doses -- may fail to control infections [Smith et al 2012].

A few mildly affected individuals have been reported to be adequately managed with prophylactic antibiotics alone [Banka et al 2013]. However, prophylactic antibiotics have a limited use for preventing severe infections or bronchiectasis and inflammatory bowel disease.

Fevers and infections require prompt treatment with antibiotics.
