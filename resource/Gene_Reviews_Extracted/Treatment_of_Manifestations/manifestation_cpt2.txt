Current treatment for long-chain fatty-acid oxidation disorders:

Avoid known triggers.

Reduce the amount of long-chain dietary fat while covering the need for essential fatty acids.

Provide carnitine to convert potentially toxic long-chain acyl-CoAs to acylcarnitines.

Provide a large fraction of calories as carbohydrates to reduce body fat utilization and prevent hypoglycemia.

Provide approximately one third of the calories as even-chain medium chain triglycerides (MCT). Metabolism of the eight to ten carbon fatty acids in MCT oil, for example, is independent of CPT I, carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase, CPT II, very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD), trifunctional protein, and long-chain hydroxy-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (LCHAD) enzyme activities.
