Management concerns are limited to the parents' desire for extreme life-support measures and provision-of-comfort care for the newborn.

Newborns require respiratory support (with tracheostomy and ventilation) to survive.

Anesthesia management concerns are described by Thompson et al [2011] and include:

Intubation with the cervical spine in a neutral position using a flexible fiber-optic scope

Utilization of evoked potential monitoring (somatosensory evoked potentials [SEPs] and motor evoked potentials [MEPs]) during the procedure to evaluate safety during intraoperative manipulations

Avoidance of volatile anesthetic agents and muscle relaxants which could affect the evoked potential recordings

Other measures:

Medication to control seizures, as in the general population

Shunt placement, when hydrocephaly is identified

Suboccipital decompression for relief of craniocervical junction constriction

Hearing aids, when hearing loss is identified
