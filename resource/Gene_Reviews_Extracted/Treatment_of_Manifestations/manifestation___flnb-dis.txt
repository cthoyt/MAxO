Cervical spine instability. Case series indicate that early intervention to improve cervical spine stability in asymptomatic infants using posterior arthrodesis is successful. In infants with myelopathic signs function can be stabilized, if not improved, by a combination of anterior decompression and circumferential arthrodesis [Johnston et al 1996, Sakaura et al 2007, Madera et al 2008].

Large joint dislocations. Conservative, nonsurgical management of hip dislocation in Larsen syndrome is often unsuccessful and operative reduction is usually required.

Scoliosis is treated medically; no effective surgical intervention has been described.

Club feet are managed in a routine manner.

Cleft palate should be treated by a multidisciplinary craniofacial team when possible.

Hearing loss. Ideally, the team evaluating and treating the deaf individual should consist of an otolaryngologist with expertise in the management of early childhood otologic disorders, an audiologist experienced in the assessment of hearing loss in children, a clinical geneticist, and a pediatrician. The expertise of an educator of the Deaf may also be required. An important part of the evaluation is determining the appropriate habilitation option. Possibilities include hearing aids, vibrotactile devices, and cochlear implantation (see Deafness and Hereditary Hearing Loss Overview).
