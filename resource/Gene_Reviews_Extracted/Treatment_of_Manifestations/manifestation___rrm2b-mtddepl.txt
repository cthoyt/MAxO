Detailed evaluations are outlined in Wellcome Trust Centre for Mitochondrial Research Clinical Guidelines.

To date, there are no known cures and few effective treatments for any forms of mitochondrial disease, including RRM2B-related mitochondrial disease. Treatment modalities currently focus on symptomatic management and supportive care, and are best implemented by a multidisciplinary team.

General management guidelines for those with systemic involvement:

Nutritional support (e.g., nasogastric tube, gastrostomy) as needed for significant gastrointestinal involvement

Early referral to a pediatric renal specialist for those with proximal renal tubulopathy

Early referral to a pediatric pulmonologist for children with evidence of reduced respiratory function. Management may include consideration of tracheostomy and artificial ventilation.

Physical therapy to maintain muscle strength and mobility and to prevent contractures

Referral to a pediatric neurologist for seizure management. Of note, seizures may be refractory to treatment.

Referral to hearing loss specialists to determine the best habilitation options for sensorineural hearing loss (see Hereditary Hearing Loss and Deafness for discussion of management issues)

General management guidelines for those with progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO):

Ptosis surgery for cosmesis and/or symptomatic relief in those with good residual orbicularis oculi muscle strength

ECG in all individuals with PEO to screen for significant cardiac conduction defects which may warrant placement of a pacemaker, particularly in those with the Kearns-Sayre syndrome phenotype

General management guidelines for both those with systemic involvement and those with PEO:

Aggressive management of fever and infection
