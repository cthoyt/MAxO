This section discusses only the management of the phenotype of nephronophthisis. Management of other findings associated with syndromic NPH (Table 3a) are beyond the scope of this GeneReview.

Currently no cure for nephronophthisis exists. Treatment is aimed at slowing the progression of CKD and its complications, according to international clinical practice guidelines for chronic renal failure (Kidney Disease â€“ Improving Global Outcomes [KDIGO] 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) for Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease [KDIGO 2013] (full text):

Correction of water and electrolyte imbalances, especially during intercurrent illness

Treatment of anemia, hypertension, and proteinuria if present. Preferred therapy may differ between adult and pediatric patients [KDIGO 2013].

Growth hormone treatment for children who have severe growth retardation as a result of chronic renal insufficiency and meet criteria for treatment [Wilson et al 2003]

Dialysis or renal transplantation when patients reach ESRD. Renal transplantation is the preferred treatment as disease does not recur in the transplanted kidney [Pistor et al 1985].
