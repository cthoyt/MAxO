Hearing. Hearing aids are usually ineffectual in individuals with Usher syndrome type I because of the severity of the hearing loss.

Cochlear implantation should be seriously considered, especially for young children [Damen et al 2006, Pennings et al 2006, Liu et al 2008].

Communication skills may be optimized if all family members, as well as affected children, receive specialized training from educators of the hearing impaired.

Balance. Tunnel vision and night blindness can combine with vestibular areflexia to predispose affected individuals to accidental injury.

Well-supervised sports activities may help a person with Usher syndrome type I to compensate by becoming more adept at using the somatosensory component of the balance system.

Vision. See Retinitis Pigmentosa Overview, Management.

Communication by sign language and lip reading becomes increasingly difficult over time as the retinitis pigmentosa (RP) progresses. Vision loss may progress to the point that the individual with Usher syndrome type I can only communicate through tactile signing.
