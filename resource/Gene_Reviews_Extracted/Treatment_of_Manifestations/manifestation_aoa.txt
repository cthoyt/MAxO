Physical therapy may be helpful, particularly for disabilities resulting from peripheral neuropathy.

A wheelchair is usually necessary for mobility by age 15-20 years.

Educational support should be provided to compensate for difficulties in speaking (dysarthria), in reading (oculomotor apraxia), and in writing (upper-limb ataxia and weakness).
