A consensus clinical management guideline for PKAN is available to provide management information at a detailed level [Hogarth et al 2017]. Pharmacologic and surgical interventions have focused on palliation of symptoms.

Symptomatic treatment is aimed primarily at the dystonia, which can be profoundly debilitating and distressing to the affected individual and caregivers. Therapies to manage dystonia in affected individuals that have been used with varying success include the following:

Intramuscular botulinum toxin

Oral baclofen, trihexyphenidyl, and clonazepam: the first-line drugs most commonly effective in PKAN

Second-line drugs including clonidine, gabapentin, tetrabenazine, and pregabalin

Intrathecal and intraventricular baclofen

Deep brain stimulation, used clinically with increasing frequency and some evidence for initial benefit, although it may not be sustained as disease progresses [Lim et al 2012, Garcia-Ruiz et al 2015, Hogarth et al 2017]

Ablative pallidotomy or thalmotomy. These ablative procedures have mainly been replaced by DBS, but in certain individuals may still be useful [Dwarakanath et al 2014].

Urgent medical treatment (often hospitalization) for status dystonicus (dystonic storm), which is a common occurrence. The PKAN consensus guideline provides detailed information about approach and management of dystonic storms [Hogarth et al 2017].

Physical and occupational therapy as indicated, particularly for those who are only mildly symptomatic. Therapies to maintain normal joint mobility for as long as possible may be useful.

Referral for adaptive aids as needed (e.g., a walker or wheelchair for gait abnormalities)

Speech therapy and/or assistive communication devices for PKAN-related dysarthria and speech delay

Other manifestations

Treatment and interventions for retinopathy as per ophthalmology

Referral to appropriate community resources for financial services, services for the blind (if retinopathy is present), and special education
