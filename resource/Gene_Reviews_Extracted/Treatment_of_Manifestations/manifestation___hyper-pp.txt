Treatment for hyperPP is symptomatic and not curative.

Attacks can often be prevented or aborted by continuing mild exercise and/or oral ingestion of carbohydrates at the onset of weakness (e.g., 2 g glucose per kg body weight).

Attacks occur more frequently on holidays and weekends when people rest in bed longer than usual

Individuals are advised to rise early and have a full breakfast.

In some individuals attacks can be aborted or attenuated by intravenously injected glucocorticoids or the inhalation of two puffs of 0.1 mg salbutamol.

Both mild exercise and treatment with Î²2-stimulating agents appear to work by stimulating the Na+K+-pumps [Clausen et al 2011].

Calcium gluconate (0.5-2 g taken intravenously) may terminate attacks in some individuals [Lehmann-Horn et al 2004].
