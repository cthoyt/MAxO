Low-vision services are designed to benefit those whose ability to function is compromised by vision impairment. Low-vision specialists, often optometrists, help optimize the use of remaining vision. Services provided vary based on age and needs.

Public school systems are mandated by federal law to provide appropriate education for children who have vision impairment. Assistance may include larger print textbooks, preferential seating in the front of the classroom, and use of handouts with higher contrast.

Many individuals with X-linked juvenile retinoschisis are able to obtain a restricted driver's license. Some individuals have found specially designed telescopic lenses useful when driving; legal use of telescopic lenses may vary by locale.

Retinoschisis affects primarily the inner retinal layers; hence, retinoschisis alone (without retinal detachment) is at best difficult to treat surgically.

Treatment of retinoschisis may require the care of a retinal surgeon to address the infrequent complications of vitreous hemorrhage and full-thickness retinal detachment. The clinical presentation of a large area of peripheral retinoschisis may mask a true retinal detachment. Advice from an ophthalmologist or retinal surgeon should be sought when in doubt.
