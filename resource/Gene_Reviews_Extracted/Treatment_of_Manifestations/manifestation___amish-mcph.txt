This disorder is fatal within the first year of life in children of the Old Order Amish of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. No intervention — including mitochondrial vitamin treatment — has shown promise for treatment or amelioration in this population. However, most experience with this disorder is based on the Old Order Amish; therefore, most clinical experience is based on a single allele. It is now known that this same allele can manifest in a more mild form [Siu et al 2010]. In this case, it was shown that a ketogenic diet improved the acidosis.

Seizures have occurred in some affected infants; the few children who were treated responded well to phenobarbital.

Physical therapy may be considered if the affected child develops contractures or other secondary neurologic manifestations.

Early intervention to stimulate and comfort the infant may be considered.

Support and respite for the family may be needed during the stressful terminal irritability phase of the disease, which can last for several weeks.
