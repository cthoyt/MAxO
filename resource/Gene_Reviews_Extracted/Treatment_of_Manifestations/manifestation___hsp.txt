At present, there is no specific treatment to prevent or reverse nerve degeneration in HSP. Treatments are directed at reducing symptoms and improving balance, strength, and agility. Current recommendations:

Daily regimen of physical therapy directed toward improving cardiovascular fitness, maintaining and improving muscle strength and gait, and reducing spasticity is recommended.

Occupational therapy, assistive walking devices, and ankle-foot orthotics are often used.

Drugs to reduce muscle spasticity (e.g., Lioresal® [oral or intrathecal], tizanidine, dantrolene, Botox® injections) and reduce urinary urgency (e.g., oxybutynin)
