Care by a multidisciplinary team that includes a general practitioner, neurologist, clinical geneticist, physiotherapist, physical therapist, social worker, and psychologist should be considered.

Symptomatic treatment includes use of the following:

Antispastic drugs for leg spasticity

Anticholinergic antispasmodic drugs for urinary urgency

Regular physiotherapy for stretching of spastic muscles. Stretching should be done manually at all levels (hips, knees, ankles) and preceded by heat conditioning.

Botulinum toxin and intrathecal baclofen can be proposed when oral drugs are ineffective and spasticity is severe and disabling. One open-label study with botulinum toxin injections showed an increase in gait velocity in persons with HSP after six months [Rousseaux et al 2007].

Urodynamic evaluation should be performed early in all affected individuals complaining of urgency or other problems, such as voiding difficulties, urine retention, and/or frequent urinary infections. Such symptoms should be monitored and treated according to individual needs and disease evolution. At the present time there is no consensus on treatment of sphincter disturbances (both urinary and anal) and management remains therefore symptomatic [Braschinsky et al 2010].
