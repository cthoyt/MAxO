Neurologic manifestations. Symptomatic pharmacologic and psychosocial support is the mainstay of care for the neurologic manifestations. Response to treatment is variable and may deteriorate over time, necessitating rehabilitative management.

Valproic acid, the first drug of choice, diminishes myoclonus and the frequency of generalized seizures.

Clonazepam may be used as add-on therapy for the treatment of myoclonic seizures.

Levetiracetam appearss to be effective for both myoclonus and generalized seizures, and is recommended in women of child bearing age.

Note: Lamotrigine is not effective in controlling the myoclonus, and may aggravate myoclonus in some patients [Guerrini et al 1998].

Renal manifestations. Renal insufficiency requires dialysis but response to treatment is poor, and renal transplantation is often necessary.
