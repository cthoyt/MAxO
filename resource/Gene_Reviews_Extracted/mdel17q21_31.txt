Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the clinical consequences in an individual diagnosed with KANSL1-related intellectual disability syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended: Multidisciplinary developmental evaluation, including feeding assessment Comprehensive speech/language evaluation including audiologic examination A renal ultrasound examination Cardiac evaluation for possible heart anomalies including septal defect and aortic dilatation Brain imaging studies in individuals with microcephaly and/or seizures If seizures are suspected, EEG and consultation with a neurologist Consideration of a Chiari malformation type 1 in individuals with the KANSL1-related intellectual disability syndrome presenting suggestive symptoms (headache, neck pain, cerebellar signs or muscle weakness) [Terrone et al 2012] Investigation of growth hormone deficiency in individuals with KANSL1-related intellectual disability syndrome and short stature, defined by a height below - 2 SD scores for age and sex Involvement of a clinical geneticist following the initial diagnosis

Treatment of Manifestations

 Treatment includes the following: Routine medical care by a pediatrician or other primary physician Early intervention with physiotherapy for feeding problems and motor delay related to hypotonia. Physical therapy aimed at strengthening the muscles as well as therapy to improve development of the child's fine and gross motor skills may also be beneficial. Speech therapy directed at improving verbal and nonverbal communication skills. Sign language, pictures, and computer touch screens may augment communication. Educational programming directed to the specific disabilities identified For epilepsy, treatment with routine antiepileptic drugs under the care of a neurologist. The seizures usually are easy to control with medication. Orthopedic care as required for scoliosis, hip dislocation, and positional deformities of the feet Standard treatment for cardiac, renal, urologic, and other medical issues Treatment for cryptorchidism if indicated

Surveillance

 The following are appropriate: Ongoing pediatric care Specialized neurologic care for individuals with epilepsy Ophthalmologic examinations at routine intervals due to increased risk for hypermetropia and strabismus Monitoring for spine deformities Monitoring as needed of cardiac and renal/urologic abnormalities
