Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 1 (AOA1), the following evaluations are recommended: Examination of cognitive function Examination of cranial nerve function Extended neurologic examination of the limbs: initial inspection, tone, strength testing, reflexes, coordination, sensory testing Ophthalmologic examination Clinical genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations

 Physical therapy may be helpful, particularly for disabilities resulting from peripheral neuropathy. A wheelchair is usually necessary for mobility by age 15-20 years. Educational support should be provided to compensate for difficulties in speaking (dysarthria), in reading (oculomotor apraxia), and in writing (upper-limb ataxia and weakness).

Prevention of Secondary Complications

 High-protein diet to restore serum albumin concentration is indicated to prevent edema secondary to hypoalbuminemia. Low-cholesterol diet is advised.

Surveillance

 Routine visits to the neurologist are appropriate.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
