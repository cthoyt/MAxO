Management



Treatment of Manifestations

 The mainstay of treatment is pharmacologic replacement of dopamine in the form of levodopa, which is converted to dopamine once it enters the brain. Other effective agents include dopamine agonists, inhibitors of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B), anticholinergics, and amantadine. Treatment of advanced or disabling symptoms includes neurosurgical procedures such as deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus. Occupational, physical, and speech therapy are often helpful.
