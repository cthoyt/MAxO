Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with primary familial brain calcification (PFBC), the following evaluations are recommended: Thorough neurologic and neuropsychiatric assessment Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Treatment of Manifestations

The following are appropriate: Pharmacologic treatment to improve anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive behaviors To alleviate dystonia and other associated involuntary movements, pharmacologic therapies as typically used in neurologic practice for the treatment of movement disorders For urinary urgency or incontinence, oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications Antiepileptic treatment for seizures Symptomatic treatment for headaches

Surveillance

Thorough neurologic and neuropsychiatric assessment is indicated annually.

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid

Neuroleptic medications should be used cautiously, since they may exacerbate extrapyramidal symptoms [Cummings et al 1983]. A poor response to neuroleptics was noted in a family with PFBC and mainly psychotic manifestations [Callender 1995]. Extrapyramidal symptoms may also be elicited or worsened by other drugs (e.g., some antiepileptics, medications to treat vertigo or dizziness).

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Therapies Under Investigation

Search ClinicalTrials.gov for access to information on clinical studies for a wide range of diseases and conditions.

Other

The response of parkinsonian features to levodopa therapy is generally poor. Manyam et al [2001a] attributed a positive response to levodopa in an affected member of a family with PFBC to the coexistence of PFBC and idiopathic Parkinson disease.
