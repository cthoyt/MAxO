Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with oral-facial-digital syndrome type I (OFD1), the following evaluations are recommended: Examination of the face, especially the mouth, and the hands for characteristic anomalies Formal, age-appropriate assessment of development and behavior Evaluation of CNS involvement Blood pressure and serum creatinine concentration Urinalysis, serum chemistries, and ultrasound examination of the kidneys, liver, ovary and pancreas for cysts if the individual is age ten years or older Audiology evaluation if cleft palate is present Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Treatment of Manifestations

 The following are appropriate: Cosmetic or reconstructive surgery for clefts of the lip and/or palate, tongue nodules, and accessory frenulae; treatment as for isolated cleft palate, including speech therapy and assessment for and aggressive treatment of otitis media Removal of accessory teeth Orthodontia for malocclusion Surgery to repair syndactyly, if present Routine management of renal disease, which may require hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis and renal transplantation Routine management of seizures Special educational evaluation and input to address learning disabilities and other cognitive impairments

Surveillance

 Surveillance includes the following: Annual audiology evaluation and assessment of speech development and frequency of ear infections in children if cleft lip and/or cleft palate is present Annual blood pressure examination and serum creatinine concentration to monitor renal function in individuals age ten years or older Annual ultrasound examination for renal, hepatic, pancreatic, and ovarian cystic disease in individuals age ten years and older

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 If an OFD1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, it is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic female relatives (even in the absence of oral, facial, and digital anomalies) to determine if they are at risk for renal disease. See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

 Affected pregnant women should undergo careful monitoring of their blood pressure and renal function during pregnancy.
