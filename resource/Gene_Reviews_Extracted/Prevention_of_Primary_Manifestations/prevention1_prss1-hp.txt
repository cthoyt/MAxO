Prevention of primary manifestations in hereditary pancreatitis is limited. The following recommendations are for individuals with (or at risk for) hereditary pancreatitis; beginning in early childhood can help prevent attacks of acute pancreatitis:

Low-fat diet. No formal guidelines for amount of dietary fat exist; however, some physicians recommend a low-fat diet to minimize pancreatic stimulation.

Multiple small meals. No evidence-based guidelines exist; however, small meals are recommended to minimize pancreatic exocrine stimulation.

Good hydration. Poor hydration (for example during exercise) can lead to episodes of pancreatitis [Authors, unpublished].

Antioxidants. One small study suggested that antioxidants may be useful in reducing the likelihood of acute pancreatitis in persons at risk for hereditary pancreatitis [Uomo et al 2001].
