In the following studies, small sample sizes limit the statistical validity and generalizability of the results; however, given the lack of effective treatments for EBS, these potentially helpful treatments should be considered on a case-by-case basis:

20% aluminum chloride applied to palms and soles can reduce blister formation in some individuals with EBS, presumably by decreasing sweating.

A case report [Abitbol & Zhou 2009] and small study [Swartling et al 2010] suggest that injection of botulinum toxin into the feet is effective in reducing blistering and associated pain. The mechanism of action is unclear, but likely relates to reduction of sweating and subsequent maceration of the skin.

In one study of a limited number of individuals with EBS-gen sev, cyproheptadine (PeriactinÂ®) reduced blistering. This may result from the anti-pruritic effect of the medication, but the true mechanism is not clear [Neufeld-Kaiser & Sybert 1997].

In another study, tetracycline reduced blister counts in two thirds of persons with EBS-loc [Weiner et al 2004]. A recent study evaluated three months of oral erythromycin therapy in six children ages one to eight years with EBS-gen sev, and showed the medication was well tolerated and improved blistering in three children [Chiaverini et al 2015]. An anti-inflammatory mechanism, rather an anti-microbial mechanism, is proposed for the effect of antibiotics in the treatment of EBS.

Other. Use of keratolytics and softening agents such as urea for palmar plantar hyperkeratosis has some benefit in preventing tissue thickening and cracking. In addition, soaking the hands and feet in salt water helps soften hyperkeratosis and ease debridement of the thick skin.
