Breast-feeding had been thought to exert a protective effect against the development of celiac disease in early childhood; however, this was not shown to be the case in two recent clinical trials [Lionetti et al 2014, Vriezinga et al 2014].

Earlier studies comparing breast-fed children with children who were not breast-fed found that breast-fed children who then developed celiac disease were more likely to have:

A later age of onset of symptoms;

Fewer classic symptoms such as diarrhea, growth disturbance, vomiting, abdominal pain, or distention [Ivarsson et al 2002];

A higher rate of “non-classic” symptoms [D'Amico et al 2005].
