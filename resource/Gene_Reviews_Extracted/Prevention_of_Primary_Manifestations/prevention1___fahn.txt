Pharmacologic and surgical interventions have focused on palliation of symptoms.

Weighted gloves can sometimes be used to assist with dysmetria.

Symptomatic treatment is aimed primarily at the dystonia, which can be debilitating. Therapies to manage dystonia in affected individuals that have been used with varying success include the following:

Oral trihexyphenidyl, baclofen, tizanidine, benzodiazepines, and/or dantrolene

Intramuscular botulinum toxin targeting abnormal co-contraction of selected muscle groups

Ablative pallidotomy or thalamotomy. Dystonia may return despite this aggressive measure [Justesen et al 1999]. (For discussion of deep brain stimulation [DBS] see Therapies Under Investigation.)

It is important to help affected individuals to maintain independence whenever possible.

Affected individuals should be referred to appropriate community resources for financial services, services for the visually impaired (if optic atrophy is present), and special education.

As needed, individuals should be referred for adaptive aids such as a walker or wheelchair for gait abnormalities and augmentative communication devices.
