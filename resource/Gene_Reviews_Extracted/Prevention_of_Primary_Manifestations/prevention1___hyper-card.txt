For individuals with familial HCM felt to be at increased risk for SCD, ICD therapy is an important consideration. ICDs are currently the best option for the prevention of SCD and have been shown to be effective in sensing and terminating ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF).

The annual rate of appropriate ICD therapies has been estimated at 2%-4% in individuals with an ICD placed for primary prevention, and 4%-11% in individuals with an ICD placed for secondary prevention [Maron et al 2007, O'Mahony et al 2012].

The potential for complications must be considered in the discussion of ICD placement. Although ICDs are generally safe, they are not benign and cumulative morbidity needs to take into account the age at implantation and duration of therapy. The rate of complications has been reported at 5% per year in persons with HCM. The rate of inappropriate shocks is roughly double the rate of appropriate therapies in persons who received ICDs for primary prevention [Maron et al 2007, Lin et al 2009, O'Mahony et al 2012].

In the absence of highly sensitive, patient-specific predictors, the decision to implant an ICD requires detailed and thoughtful evaluation, as well as the active input of well-informed patients.
