Antifibrinolytics should be used to prevent bleeding for surgical and dental procedures, childbirth, and other invasive procedures. Antifibrinolytics can be administered IV, PO, or topically, the latter especially during dental procedures.

Women who have heavy menstrual bleeding often benefit from continuous or intermittent prophylactic use of the antifibrinolytics tranexamic acid and epsilon-aminocaproic acid.
