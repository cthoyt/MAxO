The organs in MEN1 syndrome at highest risk for malignant tumor development — the duodenum, pancreas, and lungs (bronchial carcinoids) — are not suitable for ablative surgery.

The only prophylactic surgery possible in MEN1 syndrome is thymectomy to prevent thymic carcinoid [Brandi et al 2001]. Prophylactic thymectomy should be considered at the time of neck surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism in males with MEN1 syndrome, particularly those who are smokers or have relatives with thymic carcinoid [Ferolla et al 2005].
