The efficacy of androgen therapy in preventing manifestations such as gynecomastia is not clear.

Prevention of Secondary Manifestations

Women with CAIS have decreased bone mineral density, regardless of timing of gonadectomy [Oakes et al 2008]. However, women with PAIS who choose not to undergo gonadectomy do not appear to be at high risk for decreased bone mineral density [Bertelloni et al 2010].

In addition to estrogen replacement therapy, supplemental calcium and vitamin D are recommended.

Regular weight-bearing exercises are encouraged to maintain bone health.

Bisphosphonate therapy may be indicated for those individuals with evidence of decreased bone mineral density and/or multiple fractures.
