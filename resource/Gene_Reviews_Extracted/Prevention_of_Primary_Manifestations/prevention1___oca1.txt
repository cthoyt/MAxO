Skin care in individuals with OCA1 is guided by the amount of pigment in the skin and the cutaneous response to sunlight.

For individuals with OCA1A, the white skin is completely devoid of melanin and needs to be protected whenever exposed to the sun. Sun exposure as short as five to ten minutes can be substantial in very sensitive individuals, and exposure of 30 minutes or more is usually substantial in less sensitive individuals. Prolonged periods in the sun require skin protection with clothing (hats with brims, long sleeves, pants, and socks) and sun screens with a high SPF value (blocks with SPF 45-50+). Even early in life, a (pediatric) dermatologic consultation is warranted to teach parents about the use of sun-protective clothing and interpretation of the often confusing validity of numerical values and contents of sun-protective lotions and formulas.

For individuals with OCA1B, the amount of skin pigmentation varies and the use of sun screen should correlate with skin pigmentation and the ability to tan. Skin that burns with sun exposure needs protection. An early (pediatric) dermatologic consultation is warranted.
