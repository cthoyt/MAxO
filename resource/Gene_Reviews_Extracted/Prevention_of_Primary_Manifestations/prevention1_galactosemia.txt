Dietary intervention. Immediate dietary intervention is indicated in infants whose erythrocyte GALT enzyme activity is ≤10% of control activity and whose erythrocyte galactose-1-phosphate concentration is >10 mg/dL.

Because 90% of the newborn’s carbohydrate source is lactose and human milk contains 6%-8% lactose, cow’s milk 3%-4% lactose, and most proprietary infant formulas 7% lactose, all of these milk products must be replaced immediately by a formula that is free of lactose (e.g., Isomil® or Prosobee®). Such soy formulas contain sucrose, fructose, and galactose-containing oligosaccharides that cannot be hydrolyzed in the small intestine.

Elemental formulas that contain small amounts of galactose such as Alimentum®, Nutramigen®, and Pregestimil® made with casein hydrolysates have been employed in the past without obvious side effects. A formula (Neocate®) that contains neither free nor bound galactose has been used without any side effects [Zlatunich & Packman 2005].

Dietary restrictions on all lactose-containing foods including cow’s milk and other dairy products should continue throughout life; however, managing the diet becomes less important after infancy and early childhood, when milk and dairy products are no longer the primary source of energy. It is debated how stringent the diet should be after infancy [Berry et al 2004, Bosch et al 2004a, Schadewaldt et al 2004], as endogenous galactose production is an order of magnitude higher than that ingested from foods other than milk. Until more prospective evidence-based medicine studies have been performed with a large number of subjects, parents should be educated about the lifelong need for dietary restriction of cow’s milk and dairy products.
