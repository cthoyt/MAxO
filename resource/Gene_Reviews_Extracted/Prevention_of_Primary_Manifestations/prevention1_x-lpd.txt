It is recommended that boys with known or suspected XLP and hypogammaglobulinemia receive regular intravenous (IV) IgG replacement therapy every three to four weeks until definitive treatment can be provided.

HCT is the only curative therapy and should be considered in children with confirmed XLP as early in life as possible.
