Splenectomy is rarely indicated in EPB42-HS, as disease severity is usually mild or moderate. Note: When indicated, splenectomy is curative; however, it can have potential life-threatening complications (see Treatment of Manifestations). Note: Total splenectomy is not recommended for children younger than age five years even if the child requires frequent transfusions for moderately severe HS (which is rare in EPB42-HS).
