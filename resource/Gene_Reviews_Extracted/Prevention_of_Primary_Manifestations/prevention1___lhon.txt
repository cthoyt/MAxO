There is evidence that raised intraocular pressure could be a risk factor triggering visual loss in individuals at risk for developing LHON. Until further evidence becomes available, it is reasonable to set a lower threshold for initiating treatment for raised intraocular pressure in individuals with a LHON-causing variant given the possible deleterious consequences of raised intraocular pressure on mitochondrial function and retinal ganglion cell survival [Thouin et al 2013].
