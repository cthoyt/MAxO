The following methods are used to prevent infection:

Antibiotic prophylaxis. Prophylaxis for pneumonia secondary to Pneumocystis jiroveci (PCP) is indicated because infants with HIGM1 are at high risk of developing PCP during the first two years of life. Typical prophylaxis is BactrimÂ® (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) orally or pentamidine by intravenous or inhalation therapy.

Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG). IVIG replacement should be considered by the time the child is age six months, as individuals with HIGM1 cannot generate antibodies to encapsulated bacteria naturally and are at risk for overwhelming infection from these organisms. IVIG is a highly purified blood derivative (a combination of many specific antimicrobial antibodies) that is typically given every three to four weeks or can be given subcutaneously, usually on a weekly basis.

Additional antibiotic prophylaxis should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Routine childhood immunizations (killed vaccines) may be safely administered but do not preclude the need for IVIG replacement.
