Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Alexander disease, the following evaluations are recommended: Complete neurologic assessment Formal, age-appropriate developmental assessment Assessment of feeding/eating, digestive problems (including constipation and gastroesophageal reflux), and nutrition using history, growth measurements, and, if needed, gastrointestinal investigations Video/EEG monitoring to obtain definitive information about the occurrence of seizures and the need for antiepileptic drugs Psychological assessment for older patients to determine their awareness and understanding of the disease and its consequences Examination for possible scoliosis Assessment of family and social structure to determine availability of adequate support system Clinical genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations

 No specific therapy is currently available for Alexander disease. Management is supportive and includes attention to general care, nutritional requirements, antibiotic treatment for intercurrent infection, and antiepileptic drugs (AED) for seizure control. Learning disabilities and other cognitive impairments are addressed as in individuals who do not have Alexander disease. Physical and occupational therapy are indicated when assessment reveals the need for adaptive measures to maximize strength and motor capabilities.

Prevention of Secondary Complications

 The following are appropriate: Swallow studies and nutritional intervention (i.e., gastrostomy tube placement) for those with severe feeding difficulties Speech assessments to identify problems amenable to interventions such as assistive communication devices Early recognition of abnormal tone and spinal problems (i.e., scoliosis) in order to prevent long-term complications

Surveillance

 Depending on age, affected individuals should be examined at regular intervals by a multidisciplinary team with particular attention to growth, nutritional intake, orthopedic and neurologic status, gastrointestinal function, strength and mobility, communication skills, and psychological complications.
