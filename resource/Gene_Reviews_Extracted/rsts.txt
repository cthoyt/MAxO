Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS), the following evaluations are suggested [Wiley et al 2003]: Measurement of growth and plotting of parameters on published syndrome-specific growth charts Multidisciplinary developmental evaluation including assessment of gross and fine motor skills, speech/language, cognitive abilities, and vocational skills Ophthalmologic examination Hearing evaluation using auditory brain stem evoked response testing (see Deafness and Hereditary Hearing Loss Overview for details of evaluation) Dental and orthodontic evaluations Echocardiogram or evaluation by cardiologist for structural heart defects Assessment for gastroesophageal reflux as warranted Assessment for constipation Renal ultrasound examination Assessment for presence of cryptorchidism in males Orthopedic assessment of thumbs and halluces, joints and spine Evaluation of obstructive sleep apnea if indicated by snoring, particular sleeping posture, wakefulness at night, and excessive sleepiness during the daytime. Ultrasound of the spinal canal in the neonatal period to screen for tethered cord; MRI of the spinal canal should be performed in older children, if symptomatic. Clinical genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations

 The following are appropriate: Early intervention programs, special education, and vocational training to address developmental disabilities Standard treatment for refractive errors, strabismus, glaucoma, cataracts, and other eye abnormalities if identified Standard treatment for hearing loss if identified Standard treatment for cardiac defects if identified Aggressive management of gastroesophageal reflux and constipation Standard treatment for cryptorchidism if identified Surgical repair of significantly angulated thumbs or duplicated halluces Appropriate treatment for sleep apnea if identified Behavior management strategies including referral to a behavioral specialist/psychologist and consideration of medication if needed Referral of the family to support groups and other resources

Prevention of Secondary Complications

 Individuals with RSTS can be difficult to intubate because of the easy collapsibility of the laryngeal wall. An anesthesiologist comfortable with managing complex pediatric airway problems should therefore administer general anesthesia when needed. Because of these problems, individuals with RSTS may require earlier intubation and later extubation than other individuals undergoing similar procedures.

Surveillance

 Surveillance includes the following: Close monitoring of growth, especially in the first year of life Annual follow-up evaluation for ophthalmologic abnormalities Yearly audiologic screens; more frequent evaluation if a history of multiple episodes of otitis media exists Monitoring as per routine for cardiac or renal anomalies Regular dental and orthodontic follow up

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
