Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with DFNX1 nonsyndromic hearing loss and deafness, the following evaluations are recommended: Pure tone audiograms, auditory brain stem response testing Assessment of the vestibular function Analysis of the family history to identify obligate carrier females and other males who may be affected

Treatment of Manifestations

 
            Sensorineural hearing loss Cochlear implantation in affected males can improve auditory and oral communication skills. See Deafness and Hereditary Hearing Loss Overview.

Surveillance

 Hearing loss in DFNX1 is prelingual or postlingual and progressive, regular audiologic evaluation is recommended to assess hearing status and progression of hearing loss.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 It is appropriate to evaluate at-risk males at birth with detailed audiometry to assure early diagnosis and treatment of hearing loss. See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Therapies Under Investigation
