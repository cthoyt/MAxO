Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with Baller-Gerold syndrome, occupational therapy assessment to evaluate hand and arm function is recommended.

Treatment of Manifestations

 When craniosynostosis is bilateral, surgery is usually performed before age six months. Pollicization of the index finger to restore a functional grasp has had satisfactory results in a number of persons with absence of the thumb [Foucher et al 2005]. However, many children with aplasia of the thumb can use their first and second digits for grasping without pollicization.

Surveillance

 For persons with pathogenic RECQL4 variants that correlate with an increased risk for osteosarcoma, attention to clinical findings such as bone pain, limp, and fracture is warranted. Currently no data are available regarding the effectiveness of routine screening such as x-rays, MRI, and bone scan. Furthermore, the risk of added radiation exposure from diagnostic studies and the benefit of "early" detection of osteosarcoma are unknown. Because lymphoma has been observed in individuals with BGS [Debeljak et al 2009] and its allelic disorders RAPADILINO syndrome (4/14 cases) [Siitonen et al 2009] and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome [Simon et al 2010], it seems reasonable to monitor individuals for lymph node swelling and /or mediastinal enlargement on chest radiographs.

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid

 Sun exposure is to be avoided because of predisposition to skin cancer.

Testing of Relatives at Risk

 See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
