Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with congenital mirror movements (CMM), evaluations to document difficulties with activities of daily living are recommended. A clinical genetics consultation may also be proposed.

Treatment of Manifestations

 It is important to avoid stigmatizing children and adolescents with CMM and to assure that educational opportunities including university are not lost as a result of the mirror movements. Physicians should explain the disorder to parents and teachers, making it clear that intellectual disability is not associated. Adaptation of the school environment (e.g., allocation of extra time during examinations and limitation of the amount of handwriting) is recommended. Adolescents and young adults should be encouraged to consider a profession that does not require complex bimanual movements, repetitive or sustained hand movements, or extensive handwriting.

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid

 Complex bimanual movements or sustained/repetitive hand activity should be limited in order to reduce the occurrence of pain or discomfort in the upper limbs.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Therapies Under Investigation

 Noninvasive modulation of brain interhemispheric communication may be a possibility in the future [Gall√©a et al 2014]. Search ClinicalTrials.gov for access to information on clinical studies for a wide range of diseases and conditions.
