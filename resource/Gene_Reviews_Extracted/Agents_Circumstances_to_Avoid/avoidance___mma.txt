The following should be avoided:

Fasting. During acute illness, intake of adequate calories is necessary to arrest/prevent decompensation.

Stress

Increased dietary protein

Supplementation with the individual propiogenic amino acids valine and isoleucine, as they directly increase the toxic metabolite load in patients with disordered propionate oxidation [Nyhan et al 1973, Hauser et al 2011, Manoli et al 2016b]
