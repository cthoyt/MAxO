Great care should be taken to avoid enteral or parenteral exposure to fructose, sorbitol, sucrose, sucralose, and polysorbate as administration of these substances to individuals with HFI can be fatal.

The following resources can be valuable in determining medical and dietary safety.

Dietary guidance –including prohibited foods- is outlined in Table 3.

An extensive list of tolerated and non-tolerated sugars in HFI can be found online, a site curated by the Boston University HFI laboratory.

Although there is no single consolidated list of medications that contain these or related sugars, an advanced search on www.medicines.org.uk using the search term “fructose OR sorbitol OR sucrose OR sucralose” yielded 1776 results. Many such medications are oral suspensions or chewable flavored tabs designed for pediatric use. Also listed were injectable medications like immunoglobulin solutions (e.g., trastuzumab, filgrastim, some intravenous immunoglobulin solutions), vaccines (e.g., certain influenza, meningococcal), and iron supplements, as well as enema solutions and rinsing aids. For many preparations, it may not be apparent that fructose or similar compounds are present.

For parenteral medications, hospital pharmacists should clear use of medications on a case-by-case basis. Of particular note, a 24% sucrose solution (routinely administered to hospitalized neonates for minor procedures) should

not be given to neonates known to have HFI.

The fructose tolerance testing (‘fructose challenge’) to diagnose HFI can be hazardous and should not be used.
