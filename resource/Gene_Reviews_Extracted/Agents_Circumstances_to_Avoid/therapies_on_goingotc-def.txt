Avoid the following:

Valproate

Haloperidol

Fasting

Stress, especially physical stress; potentially also psychological stress

Systemic corticosteroids because they cause catabolism, which can trigger a hyperammonemic crisis

Note: If systemic corticosteroids need to be administered as a life-saving therapy (e.g., during a severe asthma attack or an anaphylactic reaction), a metabolic specialist should be consulted; at the same time, preemptive measures (e.g., increased calorie intake) should be instituted to prevent catabolism.
