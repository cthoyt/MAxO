Surgery and desmoid risk. There is evidence that the risk for desmoid tumors is increased by abdominal surgery and may be higher in surgical procedures that require two stages to complete. Individuals at high risk for desmoids (women; those with APC pathogenic variants in codons 1395-1493; those with a family history of desmoids) may consider delaying surgery longer than might otherwise be recommended or undergoing an operation that is likely to be definitive for colorectal cancer risk (e.g., total colectomy with ileostomy) in order to minimize the likelihood of the need for a second operation.

Surgery and fecundity. There is a lower rate of fecundity in women after a total colectomy with ileo-anal anastamosis than after an ileorectal anastamosis. This issue should be included as part of the discussion of surgical options with women with FAP [Olsen et al 2003].
