Drugs that cause further prolongation of the QT interval or provoke torsade de pointes should be avoided for all individuals with LQTS. See CredibleMeds® (free registration required) for a complete and updated list. Epinephrine given as part of local anesthetics can trigger arrhythmias and is best avoided.

Since electrolyte imbalances may also lengthen the QTc interval, identification and correction of electrolyte abnormalities is important. These imbalances can occur as a result of diarrhea, vomiting, metabolic conditions, and imbalanced diets for weight loss.

Lifestyle modifications are advised based on genotype. For individuals with LQTS type 1 phenotype avoidance of strenuous exercise – especially swimming without supervision – is advised. In individuals with LQTS type 2 phenotype reduction in exposure to loud noises such as alarm clocks and phone ringing is advised. In individuals at high risk for cardiac events or with exercise-induced symptoms competitive sport should be avoided [Priori et al 2013]. For some individuals participation in competitive sports may be safe. It is therefore recommended that all individuals with LQTS who wish to engage in competitive sports have their risk evaluated by a clinical expert [Johnson & Ackerman 2012, Priori et al 2013].
