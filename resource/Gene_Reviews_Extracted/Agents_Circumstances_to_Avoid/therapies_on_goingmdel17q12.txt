Individuals with HNF1B-associated renal disease, including the 17q12 recurrent deletion, who develop ESRD and require renal transplantation are at increased risk for developing new-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT); therefore, use of an immunosuppressive regimen that avoids tacrolimus and reduces corticosteroid exposure may be beneficial for those who do not have preexisting diabetes [Zuber et al 2009, Faguer et al 2011, Clissold et al 2015].
