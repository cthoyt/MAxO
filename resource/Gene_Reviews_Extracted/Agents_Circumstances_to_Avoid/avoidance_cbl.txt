Potentially exacerbating circumstances:

Prolonged fasting (longer than overnight without dextrose-containing intravenous fluids)

Dietary protein intake below the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for age or more than that prescribed by a metabolic specialist

Methionine restriction. Methionine-free formulas given to infants with methylmalonic acidemia should be avoided as the decreased methionine intake may worsen hypomethioninemia in patients with decreased methionine production.

Nitrous oxide, an anesthetic that is potentially toxic as it depletes the body stores of vitamin B12 and inhibits methionine synthase activity [Abels et al 1990, Drummond & Matthews 1994]
