Sodium valproate and barbiturates should be avoided because of their inhibitory effect on the mitochondrial respiratory chain [Melegh & Trombitas 1997, Anderson et al 2002].

Dichloroacetate (DCA) reduces blood lactate by activating the PDH complex.

A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of DCA in a different mitochondrial disease, MELAS, found no benefit and in fact documented a toxic effect of DCA on peripheral nerves [Kaufmann et al 2006].

A subsequent report described the results of long-term administration of DCA to 36 children with congenital lactic acidosis (randomized control trial followed by an open label extension) [Stacpoole et al 2008]. This study concluded that oral DCA is well tolerated in young children with congenital lactic acidosis and that it was not possible to determine whether the peripheral neuropathy associated with long-term DCA administration is attributable to the drug or to the underlying disease process. It therefore appears prudent for individuals with nuclear gene-encoded Leigh syndrome to avoid DCA, in view of the underlying risk for peripheral neuropathy caused by the disease itself in these conditions.
