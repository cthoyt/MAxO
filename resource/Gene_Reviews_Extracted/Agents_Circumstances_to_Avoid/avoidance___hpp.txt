Factors such as the following can trigger paralytic attacks and thus should be avoided when possible:

Unusually strenuous effort

Excess of carbohydrate-rich meals

Sweets

Alcohol

Prolonged immobility

Oral or intravenous corticosteroids, which may induce paralytic attacks and thus should be used with care in individuals with HOKPP

Glucose infusionm, which may induce paralytic attacks and thus should be replaced by another type of infusion
