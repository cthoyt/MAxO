Amiodarone has been reported to induce cellular and biochemical changes resulting in a phenocopy in particular of the keratopathy of Fabry disease [Whitley et al 1983].

However, little evidence of a detrimental effect in this specific group exists and the relative benefit in individuals with cardiac arrhythmia should be considered.
