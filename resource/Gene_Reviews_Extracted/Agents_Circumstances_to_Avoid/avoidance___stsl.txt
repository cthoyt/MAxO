Margarines and other products containing stanols (e.g., campestanol and sitostanol), which are recommended for use by persons with hypercholesterolemia, are contraindicated in those with sitosterolemia as they can exacerbate plant stanol accumulation [Connor et al 2005].

Note: Foods with high plant sterol content including shellfish, vegetable oils, margarine, nuts, avocados, and chocolate should be taken in moderation due to increased intestinal absorption of plant sterols in those with sitosterolemia [Bhattacharyya & Connor 1974].
