Women with a factor V Leiden allele and a history of VTE should avoid estrogen contraception and HRT.

Asymptomatic women who are heterozygous for factor V Leiden should be counseled on the risks of estrogen-containing contraception and HRT use and should be encouraged to consider alternative forms of contraception and control of menopausal symptoms.

Asymptomatic heterozygous women electing to use oral contraceptives should avoid third-generation formulations because of their higher thrombotic risk.

Homozygous women with or without prior VTE should avoid estrogen containing contraception and HRT.

For heterozygous women who require short-term hormone replacement therapy for severe menopausal symptoms, low-dose transdermal preparations may have a lower thrombotic risk [Straczek et al 2005, Canonico et al 2007].
