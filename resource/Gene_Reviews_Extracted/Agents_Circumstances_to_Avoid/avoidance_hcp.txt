Avoid the following:

Extreme caloric deprivation (i.e., total fasting, gastric bypass surgery)

Female reproductive hormones. Birth-control pills are risky and not recommended. For recommendations regarding contraception, see Prevention of Primary Manifestations, Selection of appropriate contraception for females.

Medications. Some drugs are clearly unsafe for CPOX heterozygotes. It is important to note, however, that many drugs are safe, lest providers regard individuals with acute porphyria as “untreatable.” Compilations of safe and unsafe drugs are available online and are updated as new information becomes available. See www.porphyriafoundation.com and www.porphyria-europe.com.

In theory, the most dangerous medications are inducers of CYPs, such as barbiturates and the related compound, phenytoin.
