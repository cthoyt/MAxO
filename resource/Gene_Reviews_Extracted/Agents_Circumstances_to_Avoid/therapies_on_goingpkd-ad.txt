The following should be avoided:

Long-term administration of nephrotoxic agents such as combination analgesics and NSAIDs

Caffeine in large amounts because it interferes with the breakdown of cAMP and hence may promote renal cyst growth

Use of estrogens and possibly progestogens in individuals with severe polycystic liver disease [Alvaro et al 2006, Glaser et al 2008]

Smoking
