Oral contraceptives, which may tend to increase coagulability and represent risk for thromboembolism, should be avoided in females with homocystinuria.

Surgery should also be avoided if possible because the increase in plasma homocysteine concentrations during surgery and especially post-surgery elevates the risk for a thromboembolic event. If surgery is required, intravenous fluids containing 5% dextrose in 0.5 N saline at 1.5 times maintenance should be administered before, during, and after surgery until fluids can be taken orally. If fluids at 1.5 times maintenance represent a cardiovascular risk as a result of fluid overload, basic fluid maintenance may be administered with careful clinical observation.
