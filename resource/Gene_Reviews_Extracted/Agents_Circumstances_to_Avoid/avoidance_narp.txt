Sodium valproate and barbiturates should be avoided because of their inhibitory effect on the mitochondrial respiratory chain [Anderson et al 2002].

Anesthesia can potentially aggravate respiratory symptoms and precipitate respiratory failure, so careful consideration should be given to its use and to monitoring of the individual prior to, during, and after anesthetic procedures [Parikh et al 2015].

Dichloroacetate (DCA) reduces blood lactate by activating the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.

Anecdotal reports have suggested that DCA may cause some short-term clinical improvement in mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome [Fujii et al 2002].

A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of DCA in a different mitochondrial disease, MELAS, found no benefit and in fact documented a toxic effect of DCA on peripheral nerves [Kaufmann et al 2006].

A subsequent report described the results of long-term administration of DCA to 36 children with congenital lactic acidosis (randomized control trial followed by an open label extension) [Stacpoole et al 2008]. This study concluded that oral DCA is well tolerated in young children with congenital lactic acidosis and that it was not possible to determine whether the peripheral neuropathy associated with long-term DCA administration is attributable to the drug or to the underlying disease process. It therefore appears prudent for individuals with mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome or NARP to avoid DCA, in view of the underlying risk of peripheral neuropathy caused by the disease itself in these conditions.
