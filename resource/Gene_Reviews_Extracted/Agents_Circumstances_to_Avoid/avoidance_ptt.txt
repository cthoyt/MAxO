F2 20210G>A heterozygotes:

With a history of VTE should avoid estrogen contraception and HRT; asymptomatic women should be counseled on the risks of estrogen-containing contraception and HRT and should consider alternative forms of contraception and strategies for control of menopausal symptoms.

Who are asymptomatic and elect to use oral contraceptives should avoid formulations with third-generation and other progestins with a higher thrombotic risk;

Who elect short-term hormone replacement therapy for severe menopausal symptoms should use low-dose transdermal preparations, which have a lower thrombotic risk than oral formulations [Straczek et al 2005, Canonico et al 2007, Renoux et al 2010].

F2 20210G>A homozygous women with or without prior VTE should avoid estrogen-containing contraception and HRT.
