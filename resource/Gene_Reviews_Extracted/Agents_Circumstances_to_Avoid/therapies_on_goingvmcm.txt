Contraceptive pills with high estrogen levels should be avoided, as venous malformation lesions are estrogen dependent. Venous malformations can increase in size and become symptomatic, especially at initiation of estrogen-based contraception. (In some, but not all, instances, stabilization of a venous malformation lesion and diminution of pain may be observed after three months of contraceptive pill use.)
