As in other forms of progressive myoclonus epilepsies, the use of phenytoin should be avoided.

Anecdotal reports describe possible exacerbation of myoclonus with the following:

Carbamazepine [Nanba & Maegaki 1999]

Oxcarbazepine [Kaddurah & Holmes 2006]

Lamotrigine [Cerminara et al 2004, Crespel et al 2005]
