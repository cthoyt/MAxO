While environmental factors are thought to influence the onset and severity of MLD symptoms, no specific exacerbating agents are known. Initial symptoms are often noted following a febrile illness or other stress, but it is unclear if a high fever actually accelerates progression.

Excessive alcohol and drug use are often associated with later-onset MLD, but it is unclear if this is caused by the disease or is simply an attempt at self-medication in the face of increasing cognitive difficulties [Alvarez-Leal et al 2001].

Exacerbation of symptoms has been noted following anesthesia because affected individuals may have altered responses to sedatives and anesthetics [Mattioli et al 2007, Birkholz et al 2009, Cappuccio et al 2013].
