Splenectomy to control autoimmune cytopenias and/or massive splenomagaly is discouraged because it typically does not lead to permanent remission of autoimmunity and may be associated with an increased risk for infections. The two recent cohort studies reveal clear-cut consequences of splenectomy. In the French cohort, nine (30%) of 30 affected individuals who underwent splenectomy suffered 17 cases of severe invasive bacterial infection with four deaths after splenectomy; in the NIH cohort, 27 (41%) of 66 affected individuals suffered one or more episodes of sepsis with seven deaths. Of note: Anti-microbial prophylaxis and appropriate vaccinations did not prevent the majority of episodes of sepsis, although poor compliance was found to be a risk factor in the French cohort [Neven et al 2011, Price et al 2014].

The use of over-the-counter medications such as aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be discussed with a physician as some of these medications can interfere with platelet function.
