Because individuals with Rett syndrome have an increased risk of life-threatening arrhythmias associated with a prolonged QT interval, avoidance of drugs known to prolong the QT interval, including the following, is recommended:

Prokinetic agents (e.g., cisapride)

Antipsychotics (e.g., thioridazine), tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., imipramine)

Antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, sotolol, amiodarone)

Anesthetic agents (e.g., thiopental, succinylcholine)

Antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole)
