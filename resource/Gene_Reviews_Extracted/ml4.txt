Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with mucolipidosis IV, the following evaluations are recommended: Ophthalmic examination Brain MRI Iron studies Neurologic evaluation, including EEG Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Treatment of Manifestations

 The following treatment is appropriate: Speech therapy Physical therapy and rehabilitation for motor dysfunction (mainly spasticity and ataxia) Ankle-foot orthotics in individuals with hypotonia and weakness of ankle dorsiflexion Antiepileptic drugs Topical lubricating eye drops, artificial tears, gels, or ointments for management of the intermittent ocular irritation seen frequently in younger children Surgical correction of strabismus High-contrast black and white materials for those with visual impairment Note: Corneal transplantation has not been successful because the donor corneal epithelium is eventually replaced by the abnormal host epithelium.

Prevention of Secondary Complications

 Physical therapy and rehabilitation can help prevent permanent joint contractures. An iron preparation such as oral ferrous sulfate is indicated for treatment of iron deficiency anemia resulting from poor absorption of dietary iron.

Surveillance

 Annual follow up with a generalist is appropriate.

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid

 Chloroquine may be contraindicated, based on published research in patient cultured skin fibroblasts [Goldin et al 1999].

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
