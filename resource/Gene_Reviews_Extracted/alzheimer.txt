Management



Treatment of Manifestations

The mainstay of treatment for Alzheimer disease (AD) is necessarily supportive and each symptom is managed on an individual basis [Bird & Miller 2008]. In general, affected individuals eventually require assisted living arrangements or care in a nursing home. Although the exact biochemical basis of AD is not well understood, it is known that deficiencies of the brain cholinergic system and of other neurotransmitters are present. Drugs that increase cholinergic activity by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase produce a modest but useful behavioral or cognitive benefit in a minority of affected individuals. The first such drug was tacrine; however, this agent is also hepatotoxic. Newer such drugs with similar pharmacologic action, such as donepezil (Aricept®) [Feldman et al 2004, Seltzer et al 2004, Petersen et al 2005], rivastigmine (Exelon®) [Feldman et al 2007], and galantamine [Raskind et al 2000, Tariot et al 2000, Mega et al 2005, Reisberg et al 2006, Atri et al 2008], are not hepatotoxic. Memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, has shown some effectiveness in the treatment of moderate to severe AD [Reisberg et al 2003, Tariot et al 2004]. Antidepressant medication may improve associated depression. Agitation is especially difficult to control [Teri et al 2000, Mintzer et al 2006]

Therapies Under Investigation

Treatment trials evaluating use of anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), estrogens, nerve growth factors, ginkgo biloba, statins, BACE inhibitors, and antioxidants are under way or recently reviewed [Overshott & Burns 2005, Klafki et al 2006, Masters & Beyreuther 2006]. Search ClinicalTrials.gov for access to information on clinical studies for a wide range of diseases and conditions.

Other

Vitamins and other over-the-counter medications have been used in the treatment of AD [Yaffe et al 2004]. Some, but not all, reports suggest that affected individuals taking HMG-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors for hypercholesteralemia have a reduced incidence of dementia [Wolozin et al 2000, Li et al 2004]. Immunization of an AD mouse model with β-amyloid has attenuated the AD pathology and stimulated the search for a possible vaccination approach to the treatment of human AD [Schenk et al 1999]. A human trial of this approach was halted because of encephalitis in a few subjects [Check 2002, Ferrer et al 2004, Holmes et al 2008]. Other approaches to this model are under investigation. Thus far, treatment of symptomatic AD with estrogens has not proven beneficial [Mulnard et al 2000, Wang et al 2000].
