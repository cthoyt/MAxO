Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis



The following recommendations for evaluation of individuals diagnosed with Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) are based on recent guidelines [Kline et al 2007b] (full text) and the authors' experience:

Gastrointestinal evaluation (including upper GI series, endoscopy, milk scan and/or pH probe) to evaluate for malrotation and gastrointestinal reflux which, if undiagnosed or undertreated, can lead to feeding intolerance, life-threatening recurrent aspiration, and volvulus

Plotting growth parameters on CdLS-specific growth charts. See www.cdlsusa.org (girls; boys).

Evaluation by a nutritionist if CdLS growth curves reveal failure to thrive

Radiographs of the upper extremities to evaluate for radioulnar synostosis. Physical therapy must be performed with caution to avoid causing fractures if radioulnar synostosis is present.

Multidisciplinary developmental evaluation to formulate education/therapeutic interventions with an emphasis on communication skills

Audiology evaluation with auditory brain stem response testing and otoacoustic emission testing to assess for hearing loss

Ophthalmologic evaluation, including assessment of visual acuity, dilated fundus examination, measurement of intraocular pressure, and evaluation of tear ducts for patency and function

Echocardiogram to screen for cardiac defects. ASDs are common and may not be picked up by auscultation.

Neurologic evaluation and EEG in all affected individuals

Renal ultrasonography to evaluate for structural kidney anomalies; if indicated, a vesicoureterogram (VCUG) to evaluate for vesicoureteral reflux

Urologic evaluation in males with hypospadias and/or cryptorchidism

Pelvic ultrasound to evaluate for bicornuate uterus in females; pelvic ultrasound can be performed at the same time as the renal ultrasound

Complete blood count if signs of anemia, bruising, bleeding are present

Complete blood count, immune profile (consisting of immunoglobulins; antibodies to tetanus, dipetheria, and pneumococcus; B-cell panel; and T-cell panel) and consideration of immunologic evaluation if recurrent infections are present

Consultation with a clinical geneticist

Treatment of Manifestations



The following are appropriate:

Aggressive management of gastroesophageal reflux with consideration of fundoplication if GER is severe

Surgical correction of intestinal malrotation if present

Supplementary formulas and/or gastrostomy tube placement to meet nutritional needs if there is failure to thrive

Surgical intervention of arms/hands if limb defects hinder utilization or mobility

Ongoing physical, occupational, and speech therapies to optimize developmental outcomes; alternative communicative methods (e.g., sign language, picture exchange communication system [PECS]) to facilitate communication if verbal skills are inadequate to express wants and needs

Standard treatment for hearing loss

Aggressive treatment for nasolacrimal duct obstruction as massage therapy is often unsuccessful because of malformed ducts; standard treatment for refractive errors, strabismus, glaucoma, and ptosis

Standard interventions for cardiac defects

Appropriate treatment for seizures

Antibiotic prophylaxis and follow up for vesicoureteral reflux

Orchiopexy if cryptorchidism is present

Standard intervention for bicornuate uterus, if present

Prevention of Secondary Complications



To prevent secondary complications:

Preoperative evaluation for thrombocytopenia and cardiac disease

Care during sedation and/or operative procedures in an institution with pediatric anesthesiologists experienced in the management of the small airways of children with CdLS

During anesthesia, attention to the risk of malignant hyperthermia (see Malignant Hyperthermia Susceptibility), which has been reported in a few children with CdLS [Papadimos & Marco 2003]

Surveillance



The following are appropriate:

Annual gastrointestinal evaluation including monitoring of growth

Annual evaluation by a developmental pediatrician to assess developmental progress and to target therapeutic interventions and educational modalities

Regular follow up of ophthalmologic and/or audiologic abnormalities

Routine monitoring of existing cardiac or renal anomalies

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid



No known agents exacerbate the severity of CdLS; however, caution should be exercised to avoid exacerbation of existing comorbidities including gastroesophageal reflux, self-injurious behavior, pica, and less commonly, thrombocytopenia and immunologic features.
