Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with deafness and myopia (DFNMYP) syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended if they have not already been completed: Audiology evaluation for sensorineural hearing loss and auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder Ophthalmology evaluation for myopia and other ocular comorbidities Evaluation by early intervention/educational programs for the hearing impaired including baseline speech and language assessment in children Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Treatment of Manifestations

 Appropriate treatment includes the following: Implementation of hearing habilitation devices including hearing aids and vibrotactile hearing tools as needed Consideration of cochlear implantation (CI) in individuals with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss and auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder. Although no CI has been reported among individuals with deafness and myopia syndrome, favorable outcome of CI has been reported in children with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder [Breneman et al 2012]. Enrollment in early intervention programs and educational programs for the hearing impaired to maximize long-term speech and language outcomes Routine correction of refractive error

Surveillance

 The following are appropriate: ENT and audiology evaluations at least yearly Regular speech and language evaluation to monitor language development Regular ophthalmology evaluations to monitor for potential complications from high myopia including cataracts, glaucoma, and retinal detachment Yearly evaluations by a clinical geneticist familiar with hereditary forms of deafness

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid

 Individuals with hearing loss should avoid the following: Known environmental factors for hearing loss (e.g., loud noises) Ototoxic medications

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 It is appropriate to evaluate older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt treatment of hearing loss and myopia. Evaluations can include: Molecular genetic testing if the SLITRK6 pathogenic variants in the family are known; Clinical audiology and ophthalmology evaluations if a molecular diagnosis has not been established. See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
