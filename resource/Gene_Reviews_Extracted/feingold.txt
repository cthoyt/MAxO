Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with Feingold syndrome 1 (FS1), the following evaluations are recommended: Cardiac investigation (echocardiogram) Renal ultrasound to evaluate for structural abnormalities Audiometry for the possibility of hearing loss Neuropsychological evaluation if there are concerns about psychomotor development Analysis of the family pedigree for other possible affected individuals Clinical genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations

 Appropriate treatment includes the following: Surgical treatment of gastrointestinal atresia when present Follow up and treatment of possible cardiac and renal anomalies Treatment for significant hearing loss Developmental or educational intervention for children with learning difficulties

Prevention of Secondary Complications

 Prophylactic antibiotics may be needed when cardiac or renal anomalies are present.

Surveillance

 Routine follow up for any of the above-listed medical issues by the appropriate specialist is warranted.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

 Because of the risk for major congenital abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract, heart, and kidney, high-resolution ultrasound investigations (including fetal echocardiogram) are advised in any pregnancy in which one of the parents is known to be affected.
