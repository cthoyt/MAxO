Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis



To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Charcot-Marie-Tooth hereditary neuropathy type 2 (CMT2), the following evaluations are recommended:

Physical examination to determine extent of weakness and atrophy, pes cavus, gait stability, and sensory loss

Nerve conduction velocity (NCV)

Complete family history

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Treatment of Manifestations



Treatment is symptomatic. Affected individuals are often evaluated and managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes neurologists, physiatrists, orthopedic surgeons, and physical and occupational therapists [Grandis & Shy 2005, McCorquodale et al 2016].

The following may be indicated:

Special shoes, including those with good ankle support

Ankle/foot orthoses (AFO) to correct foot drop and aid walking

Orthopedic surgery to correct severe pes cavus deformity [Guyton & Mann 2000]

Forearm crutches or canes for gait stability; fewer than 5% need wheelchairs.

Treatment of sleep apnea or restless legs [Aboussouan et al 2007]

Exercise within the individual's capability. In a systematic review of all reports of exercise for CMT, Sman et al [2015] identified the following significant improvements following exercise: strength, functional activities, and physiologic adaptations. The optimal exercise modality and intensity for people with CMT as well as the long-term safety of exercise remain unclear.

Pain and depression should be treated symptomatically [Gemignani et al 2004, Padua et al 2006].

Prevention of Secondary Complications



Daily heel cord-stretching exercises help prevent Achilles' tendon shortening.

Surveillance



Gait and condition of feet should be monitored to determine need for bracing, special shoes, or surgery.

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid



Obesity is to be avoided because it makes walking more difficult.

Medications that are toxic or potentially toxic to persons with CMT comprise a spectrum of risk ranging from definite high risk to negligible risk. Click here (pdf) for an up-to-date list.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk



See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management



A German study reviewed 63 pregnancies in 33 women with CMT and found no increase in the frequency of cesarean sections, forceps deliveries, premature births, or neonatal problems [Awater et al 2012].

Argov & de Visser [2009] reviewed pregnancy issues in hereditary neuromuscular disorders including CMT.

Greenwood & Scott [2007] have described the obstetric approach to women with mild and severe forms of CMT.

A Norway study found a higher than average rate of operative deliveries among women with CMT [Hoff et al 2005].

Therapies Under Investigation



Mathis et al [2015] have reviewed the future of therapeutic options in CMT.
