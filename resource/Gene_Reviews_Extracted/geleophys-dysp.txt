Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with geleophysic dysplasia, the following assessments are recommended if they were not performed as part of the diagnostic evaluation: Height Joint range of motion by an orthopedist/physiotherapist Echocardiography to evaluate for evidence of valvular stenosis and/or arterial narrowing Clinical history for evidence of tracheal stenosis and respiratory compromise Liver size by clinical assessment and/or ultrasound examination Eye examination for to evaluate for evidence of glaucoma Hearing assessment Clinical genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations

The following are appropriate: Joint manifestations: regular physiotherapy to prevent joint limitation Heart: valve replacement Tracheal stenosis: tracheostomy when severe

Surveillance

Annual multidisciplinary examination to assess: Height Joint range of motion by an orthopedist/physiotherapist Heart by echocardiography for evidence of valvular stenosis and/or arterial narrowing Trachea for evidence of stenosis and respiratory compromise Liver size for evidence of hepatomegaly
