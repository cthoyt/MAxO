Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis



To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with chromosome 3-linked frontotemporal dementia (FTD3), the following evaluations are recommended:

A general medical history and family history

Physical and neurologic examination

Evaluation of the extent and profile of cognitive disturbance by neuropsychological examination

Genetic counseling

Treatment of Manifestations



Behavioral changes and the loss of insight and judgment in individuals with FTD3 often present a considerable burden for caregivers. Information about the disease and psychological support for partners or other caregivers is essential.

The behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPSD) should be treated as in other types of FTD. There is no consensus treatment guideline for FTD3. In clinical practice those affected individuals who present with very aggressive symptoms have proven quite difficult to treat and have in some cases required high doses of antipsychotics and/or antidepressants in order to relieve the physical aggressiveness.

Surveillance



Members of the Danish family with FTD3 are followed in the Copenhagen Memory Disorders Clinic, a multidisciplinary clinic involving neurologic and psychiatric services, genetic counseling, molecular genetic testing, and clinical diagnostic and follow-up medical service.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk



See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Therapies Under Investigation



Experimental studies with gene therapy are ongoing [Nielsen et al 2012].
