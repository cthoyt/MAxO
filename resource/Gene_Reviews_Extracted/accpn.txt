Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy with agenesis of the corpus callosum (HMSN/ACC), the following evaluations are recommended: Developmental assessment Physical therapy assessment to determine strength and self-help skills Medical genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations

 During the first few years of life, most children with HMSN/ACC are able to achieve walking independently, but require walking aids such as canes or walkers. Early developmental/educational intervention is appropriate for cognitive delays. Depending on its degree of severity, scoliosis usually requires surgical correction. Low-dose neuroleptics may be useful for psychiatric manifestations. Referral for psychiatric evaluation is appropriate.

Prevention of Primary Manifestations

 No specific treatment is available for the sensorimotor neuropathy. Care is best provided by a multidisciplinary team that comprises a pediatrician or pediatric neurologist, an orthopedist, a physiotherapist, and an occupational therapist.

Prevention of Secondary Complications

 As the disease progresses in childhood various orthoses for the upper and lower limbs are needed. Regular physiotherapy is required to prevent contractures of the hands and feet.

Surveillance

 The following are appropriate: Orthopedic follow-up, especially during the early teens when significant scoliosis starts to appear Monitoring in the late teens for psychiatric manifestations including psychosis and paranoid delusions

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
