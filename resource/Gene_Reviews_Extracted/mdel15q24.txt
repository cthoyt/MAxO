Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with the 15q24 microdeletion syndrome, the following evaluations should be considered: Ophthalmologic examination Formal audiology evaluation to assess for sensorineural hearing loss Cardiac evaluation Brain imaging in individuals with microcephaly and/or neurologic findings Examination for genitourinary abnormalities (e.g., hypospadias or cryptorchidism in males) Comprehensive developmental assessment Consideration of neurologic referral for any unusual movements or concern for seizures Discussion of results with a clinical geneticist or genetic counselor

Treatment of Manifestations

 The following are indicated: Routine treatment of ophthalmologic, cardiac, neurologic findings Speech, occupational, and physical therapies Specialized learning programs to meet individual needs No specific antiepileptic or antipsychotic medications are indicated

Surveillance

 Appropriate surveillance includes: Routine pediatric care Routine developmental assessments Monitoring of specific identified medical issues

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

 If a fetus is known to have 15q24 microdeletion syndrome, fetal echocardiogram and ultrasound examination with an attempt to visualize the palate and look for diaphragmatic hernia are recommended. Close monitoring for intrauterine growth retardation is warranted. Counseling with regard to the developmental outcomes and medical complications of the 15q24 microdeletion syndrome is appropriate. Delivery at a center with a good neonatal intensive care team is optimal, as respiratory complications and feeding difficulties may occur after delivery.
