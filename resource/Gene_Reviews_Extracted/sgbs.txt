Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome type 1 (SGBS1), the following evaluations are recommended: Assessment of neonates for hypoglycemia Assessment for upper airway sufficiency if macroglossia is present Evaluation of young children with hypotonia and macroglossia for sleep apnea Evaluation by a craniofacial team, including a feeding specialist if orofacial clefting is present Hearing evaluation Eye examination Cardiac evaluation for structural defects and conduction abnormalities including chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram Renal ultrasound examination to evaluate for genitourinary malformations Abdominal/pelvic ultrasound examination to evaluate for intra-abdominal tumors Abdominal ultrasound examination to evaluate for visceral anomalies; further studies (e.g., MRI) if findings are suspicious Examination for evidence of skeletal anomalies requiring intervention (e.g., scoliosis during period of rapid growth rate) Development assessment including speech and language assessment Neurology evaluation / MRI of the brain if seizures are present

Treatment of Manifestations

 The following are appropriate: Prompt treatment of hypoglycemia if present Prompt treatment of upper airway obstruction resulting from macroglossia, micrognathia, and/or glossoptosis Referral of children to the following pediatric specialists as needed: Craniofacial team for management of cleft lip and/or palate, or macroglossia and related feeding difficulties Audiologist, otolaryngologist, and speech therapy for management of hearing loss Ophthalmologist for management of vision problems Cardiologist for management of congenital heart defects and/or cardiac conduction defects Orthopedist for the treatment of vertebral malformations and scoliosis if present Urologist for surgical correction of anomalies such as hypospadias and cryptorchidism Neurologist if seizures are present Oncologist if a tumor is identified Neurodevelopmental follow up for individual treatment plan that may include special education, occupational therapy, and physical therapy

Prevention of Secondary Complications

 Routine pre- and post-surgical preparation and monitoring for individuals with congenital heart disease and/or conduction defects

Surveillance

 For males with SGBS1: Monitoring for hypoglycemia in the newborn period Physical examination to monitor for scoliosis during period of rapid growth rate; radiographs as needed If development appears to be normal on initial assessment, routine monitoring of social and intellectual development Monitoring of renal function if renal anomalies are present Physical examinations to monitor for tumor risk [Lapunzina 2005]: Every three months until age four years Every four months from age four to seven years Biannually after age seven years The following screening recommendations require further study to determine benefit. The clinician and family should discuss the methods to be used: Wilms tumor. Abdominal ultrasound examination every three or four months from birth until at least age seven or eight years, and yearly thereafter [Choyke et al 1999, Lapunzina 2005]. Abdominal ultrasound examination should assess for both Wilms tumor and hepatic tumors. Note: When associated with an overgrowth syndrome, the risk for Wilms tumor decreases after age eight years [Beckwith 1998]. Gonadoblastoma or hepatocellular carcinoma. Serial measurement of serum alpha fetoprotein and beta human chorionic gonadotropin concentrations with the following suggested frequency [Lapunzina 2005]: Every four months until age four years Every six months between ages four and seven years Annually after age seven years Neuroblastoma. Measurements of urinary catecholamine metabolites including vanillylmandelic acid and homovanillic acid as well as urinary free fractionated catecholamines with the following suggested frequency [Lapunzina 2005]: Every four months until age four years Every six months from age four to seven years Annually after age seven years Annual lifelong chest radiograms have also been suggested [Lapunzina 2005].

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 Early diagnosis of affected males in a family helps identify those who will benefit from early diagnosis and intervention to reduce morbidity and mortality. See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
