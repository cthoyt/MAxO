Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with familial paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD), the following evaluations are recommended: MRI to rule out secondary causes of PNKD EEG to rule out seizures as a cause for the dyskinesias

Treatment of Manifestations

Response to pharmacologic treatment is poor; however, clonazepam or diazepam can be effective. A child age four years with familial PNKD responded to gabapentin [Chudnow et al 1997]. Szcza≈Çuba et al [2009] reported individuals from a family with PNKD who responded favorably to levetiracetam.

Surveillance

No long-term sequelae are associated with PNKD. Monitoring medication requirements and dosage is appropriate.

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid

Alcohol, coffee, tea, excitement, stress, fatigue, and chocolate are all known to precipitate attacks and thus should be avoided.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnant women who are on anticonvulsants therapy for PNKD are recommended to take folic acid 5 mg/day. Because of the risk of teratogenic effects related to anticonvulsants, women with mild symptoms related to PNKD may consider discontinuing anticonvulsant therapy during pregnancy.

Therapies Under Investigation

Search ClinicalTrials.gov for access to information on clinical studies for a wide range of diseases and conditions. Note: There may not be clinical trials for this disorder.
