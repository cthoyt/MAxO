Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis



To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with familial or sporadic hemiplegic migraine, the following evaluations are recommended:

Quantitative eye movement examination in individuals with nystagmus or complaints of incoordination or imbalance to look for additional clues of cerebellar involvement

EEG and neuroimaging studies if seizures are present in order to further characterize the seizure disorder.

Consultation with a medical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Treatment of Manifestations



Symptomatic support during an episode of hemiplegic migraine is the only therapy available.

A trial of acetazolamide for individuals with FHM1 or a trial of standard migraine prophylactic drugs (tricyclic antidepressants, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, anti-epileptic medications) for all FHM types may be warranted for frequent attacks. Limited correlation exists between drug response and hemiplegic migraine type.

There are anecdotal reports of therapeutic response to antiepileptic medications including topiramate, lacosamide, levetiracetam, and valproate, along with other medications commonly used for migraine prophylaxis.

Antiepileptic treatment may be necessary for seizures that are prevalent in FHM2 (caused by mutation of ATP1A2).

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid



In general, vasoconstricting agents should be avoided because of the risk of stroke.

Cerebral angiography is hazardous as it may precipitate a severe attack [Chabriat et al 2000].

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk



See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
