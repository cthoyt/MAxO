To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with renal coloboma syndrome, the following are recommended:

Evaluation of renal structure by renal ultrasound examination

Measurement of renal function by serum electrolyte concentrations, BUN, and creatinine

Urinalysis to evaluate for the presence of blood and protein

Evaluation for vesicoureteral reflux, by voiding cytourethrogram (VCUG) if clinically indicated

Dilated eye examination

Audiologic assessment (See Deafness and Hereditary Hearing Loss Overview for details of audiologic assessment.)

Medical genetics consultation
