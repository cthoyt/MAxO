In order to establish the extent of disease in a child diagnosed with mucolipidosis II (ML II), the following evaluations are recommended:

Radiographic skeletal survey, if not performed or incomplete in the diagnostic evaluation. Such survey in early infancy is important for comparison with similar radiographs in the third year of life.

Cardiac evaluation with echocardiography to assess valve thickening and ventricular size and function

Pulmonary radiographs; an important means of monitoring interstitial lung disease in any serious intrathoracic airway infection. Chest CT may better show fibrotic changes in the lungs. It is doubtful that the child with ML II can cooperate sufficiently to achieve reliable pulmonary function tests, by which the restrictive respiratory deficiency could be documented more objectively.

Baseline ophthalmologic examination

Hearing screen

Developmental assessment to help establish appropriate expectations for the childâ€™s developmental progress

Clinical genetics consultation
