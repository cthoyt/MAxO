To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Carney complex (CNC), the following evaluations are recommended:

Imaging or biochemical screening for endocrine tumors for diagnostic purposes only

Thyroid ultrasonography, recommended as a satisfactory, cost-effective method for determining thyroid involvement in pediatric and young adults with CNC. Its value, however, is questionable in older individuals.

In males, testicular ultrasonography at the initial evaluation

In females, transabdominal ultrasonography during the first evaluation. Unless an abnormality is detected initially, the test need not be repeated because of the low risk for ovarian malignancy.

Clinical genetics consultation
