To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Determination of the degree of facial asymmetry to establish a baseline for future recognition of progressive facial asymmetry

Ophthalmologic examination for evaluation of ptosis, strabismus, amblyopia, lacrimal duct stenosis, and increased ICP [Woods et al 2009]

Screening for vertebral (particularly cervical) anomalies using routine radiographs (At age ~2 years, increased mineralization of the vertebrae allows for better interpretation of flexion/extension views of the cervical spine in evaluation for functional instability.)

Audiologic screening for hearing loss

Examination for cleft palate; if cleft palate is present, assessment of feeding ability and growth

Examination of upper and lower extremities for anomalies; if anomalies are present, x-ray and/or orthopedic evaluation for radial ray or hallux anomalies

Measurement of height and growth velocity; if short stature and/or reduced linear growth velocity is present, evaluation by an endocrinologist

Screening developmental assessment on any child demonstrating developmental delays and all children found to have a 7p microdeletion, if developmental delay is identified, comprehensive developmental assessment
