To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with a POLG-related disorder, evaluation should always include measures of functional neurologic status.

In order to determine the baseline function for a given affected individual, it is reasonable to conduct the following evaluations as appropriate for the phenotypic presentation:

Electroencephalogram (EEG) and video EEG monitoring

Formal developmental assessment to provide a baseline of function as well as offer insights into the need for occupational, physical, and/or speech therapy

Brain MRI. On occasion the first neuroimaging study may be normal, but with certain phenotypes, such as AHS, changes may be seen in a relatively short amount of time.

Electrocardiogram. If a mitochondrial illness is suspected and if there is not yet genetic confirmation of a POLG disease it is reasonable to consider both electrocardiogram and echocardiogram.

Formal assessment of vision and hearing

Swallowing study, if bulbar signs are present

Nutritional assessment

Baseline pulmonary function testing

Sleep polysomnogram specifically for the purpose of evaluating for central or obstructive apnea or hypopnea that result in either pCO2 elevation or O2 desaturation

Liver function tests including fasting serum glucose concentration, ALT, and AST; serum concentrations of ammonia, glutamine and tyrosine (found in an amino acid panel), bilirubin, albumin, and cholesterol; and the coagulation factors (prothrombin time or INR). Liver ultrasound examination may assist in determining the presence of fibrosis.

Note: AST elevation, and to a lesser extent ALT elevation, may be due to muscle disease; simultaneously obtaining a serum CK level differentiates between liver and muscle involvement, although both liver and muscle disease can be seen in individuals with POLG-related disorders.
