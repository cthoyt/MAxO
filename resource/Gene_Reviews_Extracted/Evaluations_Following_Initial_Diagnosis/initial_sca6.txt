To establish the extent of disease and proper management of an individual diagnosed with spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6), the following evaluations are recommended:

Medical, neurologic, family and social history

Neurologic examination, including use of a rating scale to be used annually to assess progression

Brain MRI to gauge the extent of atrophy of cerebellum or other structures

Swallow evaluation for aspiration risk and counseling

PT evaluation to assess risk of falling, to determine whether assisted ambulation is necessary, and to advise regarding exercise.

Medical genetics consultation
