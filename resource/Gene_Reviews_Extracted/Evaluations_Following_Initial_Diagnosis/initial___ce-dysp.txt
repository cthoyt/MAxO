To establish the extent of disease and needs of a newborn or infant diagnosed with cranioectodermal dysplasia (CED), the following evaluations are recommended:

CT scan to determine if sagittal synostosis is the cause of dolichocephaly

X-ray of thorax and long bones to determine the extent of skeletal findings

Examination of the skin, hair, nails, and teeth

Renal ultrasound examination and urine measurements (including a urine collection test (and an optional DDAVP test) to assay polyuria, and osmolarity sampling of morning urine to determine concentrating ability). A biopsy is often taken after detection of abnormalities.

Liver ultrasound examination and measurement of liver enzymes

Ophthalmologic evaluation

Evaluation by a pulmonologist

Cardiac evaluation for detection of possible structural heart defects

Developmental evaluation

Brain MRI in individuals with developmental delay to assess the cause of the delay

Clinical genetics consultation
