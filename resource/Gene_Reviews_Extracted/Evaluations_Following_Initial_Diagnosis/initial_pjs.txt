Upper endoscopy plus small bowel examination (MR enterography or wireless capsule endoscopy) beginning at age eight years or when symptoms occur

Colonoscopy beginning at age eight years

In women, gynecologic and breast examinations and (after age 18 years) MRI

In men, testicular examination and testicular ultrasound examination, if clinically indicated

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
