To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with the 7q11.23 duplication syndrome and to guide medical management, the following evaluations are recommended:

Complete physical and neurologic examination

Plotting of growth parameters. Individuals with short stature should be evaluated for growth hormone deficiency.

Consideration of neuroimaging especially in individuals with macrocephaly and/or abnormal neurologic examination: brain MRI to evaluate for ventriculomegaly/hydrocephalus, cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, and/or white matter abnormalities. Note: Because sedation is likely to be necessary, this should be considered carefully and may not be necessary in every patient.

Cardiology evaluation

Evaluation by a cardiologist

Echocardiogram, including measurement of the aortic root and ascending aorta with computation of Z scores to monitor for progressive aortic dilation

Genitourinary system evaluation

Ultrasound examination of the kidneys

Physical examination of males for cryptorchidism

In females with unilateral renal agenesis, evaluation of m√ºllerian structures

Baseline ophthalmologic evaluation

Baseline audiologic evaluation

Clinical genetics evaluation/consultation for individualized assessment/recommendations and discussion of clinical manifestations, natural history, and recurrence risks

Multidisciplinary developmental evaluation

Speech and language (preferably by an examiner who is experienced in evaluating children for childhood apraxia of speech)

Physical therapy

Occupational therapy (including assessment for sensory integration difficulties)

Social skills

Intellectual abilities

Adaptive behavior

Vocational skills

Assessment of behavior (preferably by a licensed psychologist) including:

Anxiety (especially social anxiety disorder, selective mutism, separation anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder)

Attention problems

Oppositional behavior/aggression. If indicated, refer for a functional behavioral assessment, preferably by a board-certified behavior analyst.

Autism spectrum disorder screening. If indicated, refer for gold-standard autism assessment (ADOS-2 [Lord et al 2012] and ADI-R [Lord et al 1994], plus clinical judgment) preferably by an examiner who is experienced with individuals who have social anxiety disorder.
