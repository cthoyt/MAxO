To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with PORD, the following evaluations are recommended:

Evaluations by appropriate specialists in endocrinology, clinical genetics, neurosurgery, otolaryngology, and cardiology

Assessment for airway problems in individuals with skeletal malformations

Functional adrenal studies (cosyntropin test) to assess glucocorticoid deficiency, regardless of the presence or absence of genital abnormalities

Additional studies that may be indicated:

Cranial CT scan and/or MRI to determine the degree of craniosynostosis, hydrocephaly, choanal stenosis, and orbital depth

Radiographs to identify long-bone fractures and/or bowing, bony synostoses, and/or joint contractures

Echocardiogram if a heart defect is suspected

Abdominal and pelvic ultrasound examination to identify internal sex organs, detect any renal anomalies, and detect and monitor ovarian cysts in adolescent girls.
