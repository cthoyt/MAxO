To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID), the following evaluations are recommended:

History, including family history, growth and development, and localized and generalized infectious processes (e.g., diarrhea, failure to thrive, pneumonia, sepsis, viral and fungal infections)

CBC and differential count to document absolute lymphocyte count, if not performed in the diagnostic work up

Flow cytometric determination of T-cell, B-cell, and NK-cell numbers, if not performed in the diagnostic work up

In vitro mitogen assay of mononuclear cells (using PHA, ConA, or PWM) and soluble antigens (Candida antigen, tetanus toxoid). Rarely, pathogenic variants in the TCR pathway can alter the ability to proliferate after stimulation in response to anti-CD3 stimulation, despite normal numbers of T lymphocytes.

Functional screening of STAT3 phosphorylation after IL-21 stimulation to test functionality of the common-gamma chain

Consultation with a specialist in immunodeficiency

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
