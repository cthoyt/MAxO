Medical history and physical examination including neurologic examination

Brain MRI examination and referral to a neurologist

Complete blood count with differential

Referral to a hematologist/oncologist; bone marrow examination including chromosome 7-targeted FISH if hematologic abnormalities are more than minimal

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
