To establish the extent of involvement and needs in an individual diagnosed with nonsyndromic hearing loss and deafness caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in GJB2 (DFNB1), the following evaluations are recommended:

Complete assessment of auditory acuity using age-appropriate tests such as ABR testing, auditory steady-state response (ASSR) testing, and pure tone audiometry

Ophthalmologic evaluation for refractive errors

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
