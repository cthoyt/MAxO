To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with FLNB-related disorders, the following evaluations are recommended:

Spondylocarpotarsal synostosis (SCT) syndrome

Ophthalmologic examination for retinal anomalies

Audiometry to assess for sensorineural hearing loss

Spine films to evaluate for vertebral abnormalities that predispose to scoliosis

Cervical spine films to evaluate for cervical dysplasia

Medical genetics consultation

Larsen syndrome

Lateral cervical spine films in flexion and extension to look for dysplasia that can lead to cervical cord myelopathyNote: Early diagnosis of cervical kyphosis may influence the surgical approach used to stabilize the spine (see Treatment of Manifestations).

Audiometry to assess hearing

Assessment of the hips for dislocation
