To determine the presence and extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Complete blood counts and flow cytometric immunophenotyping of lymphocytes, especially with regard to α/β-DNT cells, in combination with physical examination and imaging studies to assess lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly

If significant lymphadenopathy is present, more extensive diagnostic procedures to detect lymphoma, especially if constitutional symptoms (e.g., fever, night sweats, weight loss) are present

Measurement of autoantibodies to assess for autoimmunity

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
