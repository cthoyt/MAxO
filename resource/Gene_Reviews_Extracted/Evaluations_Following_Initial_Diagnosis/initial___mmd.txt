To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with multiminicore disease (MmD), the following evaluations are recommended:

Comprehensive respiratory evaluation including assessment of breathing rate, signs of respiratory distress, ability to maintain oxygen saturations, pulmonary function studies, and sleep studies to rule out nocturnal hypoxia

Assessment of feeding abilities including suck, swallow, gastroesophageal reflux, and maintenance of airway while feeding; evaluation of growth parameters to identify failure to thrive and determine need for interventions including gavage feeds and gastrostomy tube insertion

Spinal x-rays to evaluate for presence of scoliosis; physical examination for joint contractures

Cardiac evaluation for cardiomyopathy/cardiac involvement secondary to respiratory complications

Physical and occupational therapy evaluation to develop interventions based on the distribution and extent of weakness

Speech evaluation, especially if dysarthria or hypernasal speech is present

Orthodontic evaluation for palatal anomalies

Clinical genetics consultation
