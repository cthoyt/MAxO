To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with FLNA-related periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH) the following evaluations are recommended:

Evaluation by a neurologist

Evaluation by an epileptologist if seizures are present

Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the intracranial vessels, carotid arteries, and aorta to address the increased risk for stroke

Echocardiogram or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRA) to evaluate for valvular dysplasia, congenital cardiac anomalies, or aortic and vascular disease. Because of the potential risk for congenital cardiovascular anomalies and/or aortic aneurysm, a baseline evaluation by a cardiologist may be prudent.

Evaluation by a hematologist if findings suggest a bleeding diathesis

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
