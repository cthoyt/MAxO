Assessment of muscle strength, muscle wasting and tendon reflexes. EMG and/or muscle biopsy may be necessary.

Baseline pulmonary function studies

Cardiac evaluation by echocardiogram and ECG

Blood alkaline phosphatase, urine pyridinoline studies and, if indicated, skeletal x-ray or bone scan studies to evaluate distribution and severity of Paget disease of the bone

Baseline neuropsychological studies of behavior and mental status
