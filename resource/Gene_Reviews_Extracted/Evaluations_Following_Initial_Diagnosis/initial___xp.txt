To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), the following evaluations are recommended (reviewed in Tamura et al [2014]).

Skin

Perform baseline examination of the skin (including all sun-exposed as well as sun-shielded areas) for evidence of sunlight-induced damage including pigmentary changes, precancerous lesions, and skin cancers.

For examination of the scalp, use a hair dryer (on a cool setting) to blow the hair aside.

Examination of the lip and adjacent tip of the tongue for signs of sun damage, including actinic cheilitis (a type of actinic keratosis or leukoplakia occurring on the lips) and prominent telangiectasia, which may precede the development of cancer in these areas [Butt et al 2010].

Baseline clinical color photographs of the entire skin surface with close-ups (including a ruler) of individual lesions to facilitate follow-up and detection of early skin cancers.

Eyes

Examine the lids and anterior UV-exposed portions of the globe for evidence of sun-induced damage including ectropion, entropion, inflammatory masses (pterygia, pinguecula), clouding of the cornea, and cancer of the lids, conjunctiva, or cornea. Eversion of the lids may be necessary to detect cancers of the mucosal surface.

Use the Schirmer test to detect dry eyes. This test involves measurement of the extent of absorption of tears into filter paper placed under eyelids for a few minutes [Brooks et al 2013].

Neurologic

Deep tendon reflex testing

Measurement of the occipital frontal circumference (OFC), to determine if microcephaly is present

MRI of the brain and nerve conduction velocities, if other neurologic problems are detected

Auditory. Baseline audiometry evaluation to screen for the sensorineural hearing loss, which may be present as a component of the XP-associated neurologic abnormalities [Totonchy et al 2013]

Genetic. Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
