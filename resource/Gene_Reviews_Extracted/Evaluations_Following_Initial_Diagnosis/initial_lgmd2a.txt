To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with calpainopathy, the following evaluations are recommended if they have not already been completed:

Complete physical evaluation including the grading of muscle strength in single upper, lower, proximal, and distal muscles and the analysis of several functional performances

Orthopedic examination when gait is severely impaired

When walking ability is compromised, an evaluation for physical therapy and orthoses, especially in later stages of the disease

Baseline pulmonary function testing (including forced vital capacity measurement)

Baseline cardiac evaluation including echocardiogram

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
