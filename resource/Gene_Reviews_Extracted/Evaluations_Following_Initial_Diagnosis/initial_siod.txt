To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia (SIOD), the following evaluations are recommended:

Measurement of growth and assessment of body proportions, with plotting on age-appropriate growth charts [Lücke et al 2006a]

Evaluation of renal function by measurement of serum concentrations of creatinine and urea, protein excretion in urine, and creatinine clearance

Referral to a nephrologist for evaluation

Hematology evaluations to assess lymphopenia, anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia

Immunology evaluations to evaluate the numbers of memory and naïve CD4 and CD8 T cells and B cells and immunoglobulin levels

Assessment of developmental status with referral for formal evaluation if significant developmental delays or schooling delays are identified

Dental evaluation after teeth are present

Ophthalmologic evaluation

Detailed history for headaches or neurologic abnormalities

Orthopedic evaluation for symptoms of joint pain or evidence of scoliosis or kyphosis

Assessment for osteopenia

Thyroid function studies

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
