To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Angelman syndrome (AS), the following evaluations focused on neurologic assessment and good preventive practice are recommended:

Baseline brain MRI and EEG

Note: Typically, management of seizures (or assessment of risk for seizures) is not significantly helped by repetitive EEG or MRI testing.

Musculoskeletal examination for scoliosis and gait impairment (e.g., extent of foot pronation or ankle subluxation; tight Achilles tendons) and the extent of muscular hypotonia; orthopedic referral as needed

Ophthalmology examination for strabismus, evidence of ocular albinism (in deletion-positive AS), and visual acuity

Developmental evaluation focused on: (1) nonverbal language ability and related educational and teaching strategies; and (2) physical therapy to enable optimal ambulation

Evaluation for gastroesophageal reflux in infants and young children; dietary evaluation to assure optimal nutritional status

Clinical genetics consultation
