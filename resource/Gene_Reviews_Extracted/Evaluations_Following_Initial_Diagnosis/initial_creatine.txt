To assess the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with CCDS the following investigations should be performed:

Detailed neurologic clinical evaluation for the degree of global developmental delay or intellectual disability, epilepsy, movement disorder, and behavior problems

Neuropsychological assessment of cognition and speech

Video documentation of movement disorder

EEG, if any clinical seizures

Prior to initiation of creatine monohydrate supplementation, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) for baseline assessment of kidney function

Baseline determination of cerebral creatine level by brain 1H-MRS to document creatine deficiency [St√∂ckler et al 1996, Schulze et al 2001]

ECG and echocardiogram for cardiac involvement

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
