To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), the following evaluations are recommended:

Respiratory status, including physical examination, pulse oximetry, and chest radiographs (as indicated)

Tests of renal function, including serum concentrations of BUN, creatinine, and cystatin C, which allows a more accurate estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) [Gunay-Aygun et al 2010a]

Serum electrolyte concentrations to identify electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hyponatremia, hyperkalemia)

Urinalysis to assess for the urinary concentration and proteinuria. Clinical assessment of intravascular volume status for possible volume depletion or overload.

Note: White blood cells are commonly present in the urine of children with ARPKD and may not represent infection. If there is a clinical suspicion of urinary tract infection, a urine culture should be obtained before initiating treatment.

Renal ultrasonography (consider high-resolution technology when available)

Measurement of blood pressure. If elevated, home blood pressure monitoring can be helpful in distinguishing fixed hypertension from “white coat” hypertension (i.e., high blood pressure that occurs during medical examinations).

Assessment of feeding, weight gain, and linear growth with formal nutrition consultation as appropriate

Measurement of liver transaminases, serum bile acids, hepatic synthetic function (e.g., by assessing serum albumin concentration, 25-OH vitamin D levels, vitamin E levels and coagulation studies), fat-soluble vitamin levels, complete blood counts, physical examination for hepatomegaly/splenomegaly, and abdominal ultrasonography to assess the clinical extent of liver involvement

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
