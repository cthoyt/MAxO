To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with EXOSC3-related pontocerebellar hypoplasia, the following are recommended:

Optionally to evaluate disease progress: neurologic evaluation (EMG, NCV) and brain MRI.

Pediatric evaluation, including assessment of feeding, pulmonary function, and nutritional status

Ophthalmologic examination including fundoscopy to assess the optic nerve and measurement of visual acuity.

Orthopedic evaluation to assess joint contractures and scoliosis.

Electroencephalography in those with suspected liability of seizures

Medical genetics consultation, including counseling and prenatal advice regarding future pregnancies and counseling of related family members.
