To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1), the following evaluations are recommended:

Personal medical history with particular attention to features of NF1

Physical examination with particular attention to the skin, skeleton, cardiovascular system, and neurologic systems

Ophthalmologic evaluation including slit lamp examination of the irides

Developmental assessment in children

Other studies as indicated on the basis of clinically apparent signs or symptoms

Clinical genetics consultation

In addition, a family history with particular attention to features of NF1 should be obtained, and physical examinations and ophthalmologic examinations (including slit lamp exams) should be performed on both parents to determine if the condition in the affected individual was inherited or occurred de novo. This determination is necessary for genetic counseling and may help identify patients who have a condition that is not caused by mutation of NF1, such as Legius syndrome or constitutive mismatch repair deficiency (see Differential Diagnosis).

The value of performing routine head MRI scanning in individuals with NF1 at the time of diagnosis is controversial.

Proponents state that such studies are useful in helping to establish the diagnosis in some individuals, in identifying any structural anomaly of the brain or skull, tumors, or vascular disease before it becomes clinically apparent in others, and in evaluating the context in which extracranial complications occur in still others.

Those who oppose routine head MRI scanning point to the uncertain clinical significance of features such as UBOs, the cost of such imaging, and the requirement for sedation in small children. Although clinical management should not be affected by the presence of intracranial lesions such as UBOs or optic nerve thickening in asymptomatic individuals with NF1, finding such lesions may result in regularly repeating the MRI for reassurance despite the continued absence of related symptoms, adding further to the cost as well as to the anxiety of the individual and family, without any benefit.
