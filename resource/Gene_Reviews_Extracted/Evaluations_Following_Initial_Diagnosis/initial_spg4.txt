To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with spastic paraplegia 4 (SPG4), the following evaluations are recommended:

Neuro-urologic examination is advised for individuals who have sphincter disturbances.

Whether neuropsychological testing should be performed to assess the cognitive impairment frequently reported in individuals with SPG4 remains unclear. So far, no consensus exists on the type of tests that should be performed, the timing of the tests, and the purpose. Considering that cognitive impairment is often absent or is detectable only by neuropsychological testing, one should be wary of increasing the burden of individuals with SPG4, and probably only recommend further testing when required by the affected individual.

Electrophysiologic investigations may be advisable in case of pain and/or edema in the lower limbs to evaluate for associated neuropathy. Neuropathy (not a feature of SPG4 per se) may occur in individuals with SPG4 for other reasons and should be investigated and adequately treated. Because of the underlying HSP the neuropathy may remain undiagnosed if routine investigations are not conducted.

Spinal MRI examination to exclude any additional degenerative disorder can be considered if unusual symptoms or pain are present.

A thorough examination for associated restless legs syndrome (RLS) also appears to be warranted [Sperfeld et al 2007].

Clinical genetics consultation is appropriate.
