To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with spastic paraplegia 3A (SPG3A), the following evaluations may be indicated:

Orthopedic evaluation in persons with early onset of SPG3A who have developed musculoskeletal complications including scoliosis or foot deformities

Physical and occupational therapy evaluation in children with early onset of disease

Urologic evaluation in persons with prominent urinary bladder hyperactivity

Electromyography and nerve conduction studies in persons with associated axonal neuropathy or neurogenic pain in the lower extremities caused by possible lumbo-sacral radiculopathy secondary to lumbar hyperlordosis and degenerative vertebral changes

Clinical genetics consultation
