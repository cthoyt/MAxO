To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles, the following evaluations are recommended:

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Ophthalmologic examination

Determination of resting gaze position, head position with eyes in resting gaze position, and vertical and horizontal gaze restrictions

Evaluation for aberrant movements including synergistic convergence and divergence, globe retraction, Marcus Gunn jaw wink

Palpebral fissure size measurement

Anterior segment evaluation to detect corneal exposure

Levator function testing

Optional forced duction testing

Refraction, including cycloplegic refraction in children

Photographic documentation for future comparison

Neuroimaging suggested if there are any additional neurologic symptoms or developmental delays

Strongly recommended if eye muscle surgery is planned:

Brain and brain stem MRI scan to determine the size and/or course of the oculomotor and trochlear nerves

High-resolution orbital MRI (1- to 3-mm cuts) to detect abnormalities in the size and/or course of the extraocular muscle(s) and atrophy of the superior rectus-levator complex
