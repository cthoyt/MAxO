To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), the following evaluations are recommended (if they were not performed as part of the diagnostic evaluation):

Assessment of growth

Evaluation of immunologic status to include:

Complete blood count;

Absolute number of B-cells, T-cells, and T-cell subsets, with special attention to na√Øve CD4+CD45RA cells;

Proliferative response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to stimuli;

Concentration of total serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM) and IgG subclasses;

Evaluation for viruses with lymphotrotropic capacity (i.e., EBV and CMV).

Evaluation for malignancy, including a focused family history of other individuals with cancer

Evaluation of the endocrinologic status in females who are of pubertal age to include pelvic ultrasound to evaluate for streak gonads and plasma levels of FSH, LH, and estrogen [Chrzanowska et al 2010a]

Assessment of cognitive development and intellectual abilities

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
