To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with LQTS, the main focus in the management of individuals with LQTS is to identify the subset of individuals at high risk for cardiac events. For this risk stratification the following evaluations are recommended:

ECG evaluation. Individuals with a QTc interval >500 ms are at higher risk for an event; individuals with QTc interval >600 ms are at extremely high risk [Priori et al 2003, Goldenberg et al 2008] Overt T-wave alternans, especially when present despite proper beta-blocker therapy, is also associated with a higher risk of cardiac events [Priori et al 2013]. Individuals with a pathogenic variant who have a normal QTc interval are at low risk [Priori et al 2013].

Medical history. Individuals with syncope or cardiac arrest in the first year of life [Schwartz et al 2009, Spazzolini et al 2009] or younger than age seven years [Priori et al 2004] are at higher risk. These individuals may not be fully protected by pharmacologic treatment. Individuals with arrhythmic events while on proper pharmacologic treatment are also at higher risk [Priori et al 2013]. Asymptomatic individuals with pathogenic variants or individuals with prolonged QT intervals who have been asymptomatic at a young age (age <40 years) are at low risk for events later in life, although females remain at risk after age 40 years [Locati et al 1998].
