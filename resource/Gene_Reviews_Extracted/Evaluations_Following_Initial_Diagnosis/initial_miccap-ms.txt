Developmental assessment to determine the types of services and therapies needed (e.g., physiotherapy, occupational therapy, communication assistance)

Pediatric neurology evaluation

Ophthalmology evaluation to assess for functional vision, strabismus, refractive errors, and optic atrophy

Swallowing/feeding evaluation to assess for dysphagia and aspiration and determine need for enteral feeding

Baseline audiology evaluation

Baseline echocardiogram and abdominal ultrasound examination

Pediatric palliative care consultation and psychosocial support for family

Clinical genetics consultation
