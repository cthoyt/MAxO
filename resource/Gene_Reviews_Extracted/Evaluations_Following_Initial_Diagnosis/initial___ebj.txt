To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB), the following evaluations are recommended:

Evaluation of the sites of blister formation, including mouth, esophagus, and airway in a child with progressive hoarseness or stridor

Direct examination of the airway by an experienced otolaryngologist with appropriately small and lubricated instruments to determine the extent of airway compromise so that decisions regarding tracheostomy can be discussed with the family

Evaluation for gastroesophageal reflux disease which may cause additional trauma to the upper airway [Ida et al 2012]

Evaluation for existing osteopenia through skeletal radiographs or DEXA scan

Evaluation for cardiomyopathy by clinical evaluation and/or echocardiogram [Fine et all 2008]

Measurements of hemoglobin and electrolytes to evaluate for anemia and electrolyte imbalance

Skin bacterial cultures and blood cultures in clinically ill infants to decide appropriate antibiotic treatment

Clinical genetics consultation
