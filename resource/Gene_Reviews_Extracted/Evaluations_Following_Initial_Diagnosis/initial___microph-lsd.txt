Brain MRI with and without contrast to evaluate for corpus callosum dysgenesis and other neurologic abnormalities

Developmental assessment, with further evaluation if significant delays are identified

Hearing evaluation

Cardiac examination

Consideration of abdominal MRI and standard protocols for management of diaphragmatic hernia

Genetics consultation
