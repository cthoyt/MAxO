To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2), the following evaluations are recommended:

Routine clinical evaluation of muscle strength and functional status

Examination by an ophthalmologist familiar with DM iridescent posterior subcapsular cataracts in order to establish a baseline

Initial cardiac evaluation including at minimum:

ECG to establish a baseline record for future comparison

Holter monitoring or invasive electrophysiologic testing if the person is either symptomatic or shows significant rhythm or conduction abnormalities on routine ECG

Because of the risk of cardiomyopathy, consideration of echocardiogram and possible cardiac MRI [Spengos et al 2012]

Baseline serologic testing including fasting lipid profiles, glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin concentrations to assess for evidence of insulin insensitivity and diabetes mellitus

Measurement of serum concentrations of testosterone and FSH in post-pubertal males to assess gonadal function

Thyroid studies. While thyroid dysfunction has not been conclusively and causatively related to the DM2-causing pathogenic variants, hypothyroidism from any cause has been associated with increased muscle weakness and symptoms in individuals with DM2 [Sansone et al 2000, Day & Ranum 2005].

Measurement of the serum activities of CK, transaminases (AST and ALT), and Î³-glutamyltransferase (GGT). Serum activities of AST, ALT, and GGT are frequently elevated in individuals with DM2, although it is unclear whether the abnormal levels are hepatocellular or myogenic in origin. Determination of baseline abnormal transaminase and GGT activities resulting from DM2 can help prevent needless investigations of the liver.

Serum protein electrophoresis and immunoprotein electrophoresis to establish a baseline, since the gamma fraction is frequently reduced in individuals with DM2 as a result of low levels of both IgG and IgM. Although these changes have not been associated with clinical problems, determination of abnormal immunoglobulin levels in persons with DM2 can establish individual baseline values and prevent misinterpretation of future studies demonstrating the hypogammaglobulinemia.
