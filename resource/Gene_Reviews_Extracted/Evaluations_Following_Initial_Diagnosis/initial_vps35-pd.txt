To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with VPS35-related Parkinson disease, the following evaluations are recommended:

Perform neurologic examination including assessment of tremor, hypokinesia, rigidity, postural reflexes, gait (propulsion, arm swing, stride length), and autonomic findings (e.g., orthostasis).

Assess cognitive function and psychiatric manifestations (e. g., hallucinations, delusions, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders).

Evaluate levodopa response.

Consider consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor.
