To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Duane syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended:

Family history

Ophthalmologic examination

Determination of primary gaze position, head position with eyes in primary position, and horizontal and vertical gaze restrictions

Evaluation for aberrant movements. Globe retraction with narrowing of the palpebral fissure in adduction is the sine qua non of Duane syndrome. Other features sometimes observed include up- and downshoot on attempted adduction and Marcus Gunn jaw wink.

Optional forced duction testing and/or force generation testing in cooperative individuals

Photographic documentation to identify changes in the condition and for future review

If surgery is planned, consideration of brain and orbital MRI to determine brain stem and orbital anatomy (muscles and nerves)

General physical examination. Because of association with systemic anomalies, affected children should have a complete physical examination.

If surgery is performed, forced duction testing to confirm tightness of the horizontal rectus muscles

The following may be considered:

Hearing evaluation

Clinical genetics consultation if there is a family history of Duane syndrome, dysmorphic features and/or congenital anomalies in the proband, or if a pathogenic variant is found in CHN1
