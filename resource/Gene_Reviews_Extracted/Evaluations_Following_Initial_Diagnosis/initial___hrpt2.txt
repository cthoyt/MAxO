To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with a CDC73-related disorder, the following are recommended:

Evaluation for primary hyperparathyroidism: measurement of concomitant intact parathyroid hormone levels and serum calcium concentration

Baseline bone density of the lumbar spine, hips, and distal radius by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and 24-hour urine collection for calcium in individuals with evidence of primary hyperparathyroidism

Evaluation for jaw tumors: panoramic jaw x-ray with neck shielding

Evaluation for renal lesions: renal ultrasound examination preferred; CT and/or MRI as clinically indicated

Evaluation for uterine tumors in women starting at reproductive age: pelvic examination as part of routine gynecologic care; pelvic ultrasound examination (preferred) and other imaging studies (CT and/or MRI) as clinically indicated

Consultation with a medical genetics professional (e.g., medical geneticist, genetic counselor): recommended
