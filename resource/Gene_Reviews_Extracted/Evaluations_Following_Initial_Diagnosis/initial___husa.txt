To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with genetic atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (aHUS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Renal function

Creatinine clearance (i.e., glomerular filtration rate [GFR])

Serum concentration of creatinine resources

Urinalysis

Hematologic status

Platelet count

Erythrocyte count

Search for schistocytes in the blood smear

Leukocyte count

Other

Serum LDH concentration

Haptoglobin

Serum C3 and C4 concentrations

Plasma concentrations of Bb and sC5b-9

Measure serum concentrations of CFH and CFI

Assessment of CD46 expression on leukocytes

Testing for CFH autoantibodies because affected individuals who have autoantibodies could benefit from an immunosuppressive therapy (see Treatment of Manifestations)

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
