To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with alpha-thalassemia (Î±-thalassemia), the following phenotype-based evaluations are recommended:

Hemoglobin Bart hydrops fetalis (Hb Bart) syndrome. See Prenatal Testing and Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis.

Hemoglobin H (HbH) disease

Differentiation of deletion (mild) from non-deletion (moderate-to-severe) forms of HbH disease by appropriate molecular genetic testing of HBA1 and HBA2 is important at presentation because of varying severity.

Consider referral to a hematologist.

Consider consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor.
