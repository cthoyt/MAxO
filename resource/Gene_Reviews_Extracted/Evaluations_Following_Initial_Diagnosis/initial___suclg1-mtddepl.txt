To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with SUCLG1-related mtDNA depletion syndrome the following evaluations are recommended:

Comprehensive neurologic examination and developmental/cognitive assessment. The following diagnostic modalities can be considered to assess the degree of neurologic involvement:

Brain MRI (if not performed during the diagnostic evaluation) to establish the degree of central nervous system involvement

EEG if seizures are suspected

Echocardiogram to assess for cardiomyopathy

Liver function tests including transaminases, albumin, total and direct bilirubin, and coagulation profile.

Audiology evaluation

Ophthalmologic examination for evidence of ptosis and/or strabismus

Nutritional evaluation and swallowing assessment for feeding difficulties and growth failure

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
