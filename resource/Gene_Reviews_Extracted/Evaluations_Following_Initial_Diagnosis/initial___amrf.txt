To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with action myoclonus â€“ renal failure (AMRF) syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended:

Clinical evaluation including cognitive function and school performance, emotional features, eye movements, coordination, handwriting, walking

Examination of myoclonus including evaluation at rest, with action, and in response to stimuli

EEG evaluation including photosensitivity before therapy is initiated, as it is most characteristic before the use of anticonvulsant medication

Renal function

Audiogram and brain stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) to assess the possibility of clinical or subclinical sensorineural hearing loss [Rubboli et al 2011, Perandones et al 2012, Perandones et al 2014]

Nerve conduction velocities (NCV) and needle electromyography (EMG)

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
