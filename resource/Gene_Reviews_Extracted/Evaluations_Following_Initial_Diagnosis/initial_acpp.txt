To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Baseline assessments by a neurologist and cardiologist familiar with periodic paralysis and long QT (LQT) respectively

Serum potassium concentrations at baseline and during attacks of weakness

12-lead ECG and 24-hour Holter monitor

Electrophysiologic studies including the long exercise protocol [Kuntzer et al 2000, Fournier et al 2004]

Verification that serum TSH concentration is within normal limits

Clinical genetics consultation
