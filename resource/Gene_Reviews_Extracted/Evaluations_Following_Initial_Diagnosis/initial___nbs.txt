To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome (NCBRS), the following evaluations are recommended:

EEG to determine if seizures are present, with consideration of referral to an epileptologist for seizure management

Neurologic and/or developmental examination to assess developmental milestones and identify neurologic findings or deficits

Evaluation for occupational, speech, or physical therapy as needed

Dental evaluation if dental eruption is delayed

Audiology evaluation with auditory brain stem response testing and otoacoustic emission testing to assess for hearing loss

Ophthalmologic examination, including visual acuity and dilated fundus examination

Evaluation for cryptorchidism in males

Consultation with a medical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
