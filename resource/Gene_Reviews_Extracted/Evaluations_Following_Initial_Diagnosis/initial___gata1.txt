To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with GATA1-related cytopenia, the following are recommended:

Complete blood count and examination of the peripheral smear to assess the degree of cytopenia(s)

Detailed history of age at which hematologic disease was manifest

Documentation of abnormal/unexpected bleeding episodes and platelet counts obtained at the time of the episodes to help determine whether platelet function is abnormal and whether disease severity has changed over time

Note: Platelet aggregation studies may also be useful to identify functional abnormalities that predict a greater risk of bleeding for any given platelet count, but studies can be difficult to interpret when platelet counts are lower than 100,000/Î¼L.

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
