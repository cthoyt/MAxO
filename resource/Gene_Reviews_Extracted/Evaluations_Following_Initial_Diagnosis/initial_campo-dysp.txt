To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with campomelic dysplasia (CD), the following investigations are recommended:

Karyotype analysis to identify abnormalities involving the SOX9 locus on 17q24.3-q25.1 and especially in phenotypic females to identify those with a 46,XY karyotype

Full skeletal survey including views of the cervical spine to identify cervical vertebral abnormalities

Hearing screening

Medical genetics consultation
