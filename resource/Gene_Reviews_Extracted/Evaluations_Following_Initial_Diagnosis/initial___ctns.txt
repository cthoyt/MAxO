To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with cystinosis, the following evaluations are recommended.

In individuals who are initially diagnosed at any age:

Height and weight, plotted on age-appropriate growth charts

Renal tubular and glomerular function, especially serum concentrations of creatinine, phosphate, bicarbonate, and potassium; and urine concentrations of creatinine, phosphate, bicarbonate, potassium, glucose, and protein. Quantitative measurement of urine amino acid loss helps to identify the severity of renal Fanconi syndrome [Charnas et al 1991].

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or creatinine clearance test

Thyroid function studies

Lipid panel

Renal ultrasound examination for evaluation of nephrocalcinosis

Ophthalmologic evaluation, including slit lamp examination of the cornea to assess corneal involvement, ERG to assess retinal involvement, and fundoscopic examination for possible intracranial hypertension

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

In individuals who are initially diagnosed at an older age:

In pre- and postpubertal males, measurement of serum concentration of testosterone, FSH, and LH

Glucose tolerance test to assess for diabetes mellitus if symptoms are present

Baseline ophthalmology evaluation, including a fundoscopic examination

Evaluation of the extent of metabolic bone disease causing skeletal deformities by performing skeletal radiographs and DEXA scan

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
