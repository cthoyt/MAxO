To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with hereditary fibrosing poikiloderma with tendon contractures, myopathy, and pulmonary fibrosis (POIKTMP), the following evaluations are recommended:

Dermatologic evaluation

Physical therapy assessment

Evaluation by pulmonary specialists including pulmonary function testing to evaluate for restrictive lung disease and/or pulmonary fibrosis

Muscle MRI to evaluate for progressive muscle involvement (optional)

Blood tests:

Liver function: SGOT, SGPT, ALP, GGT

Baseline complete blood count with differential. Individuals with clinical evidence of anemia or cytopenias should be evaluated by CBC and bone marrow biopsy if clinically indicated.

Fecal elastase level if steatorrhea is present

Ophthalmologic examination to evaluate for cataracts or other abnormalities

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
