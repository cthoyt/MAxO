To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with Proteus syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended [Tosi et al 2011]:

Detailed and comprehensive (general, spine, and hand) orthopedic evaluation

Skeletal survey as a baseline study of the extent and severity of overgrowth

CT imaging, possibly with three-dimensional reconstruction for patients with significant scoliosis. As the vertebral bodies are commonly progressively deformed, this study can be very helpful for surgical planning.

Pulmonology consultation, pulmonary function testing, and high-resolution computed tomography of the chest for patients with signs or symptoms compatible with bullous pulmonary disease

Other imaging techniques are highly useful and should be determined by manifestations on examination and by the medical history. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound have been extremely useful in the characterization of this disorder [Jamis-Dow et al 2004].
