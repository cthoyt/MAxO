To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual with PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth, the following evaluations are recommended:

A thorough history to identify key features of PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth

A physical examination including a thorough skin, cardiac, abdominal, and musculoskeletal evaluation, as well as a detailed neurologic assessment

Investigations to detect abnormalities before they result in significant morbidity/mortality:

Baseline brain and spinal cord imaging, especially in children with hemimegalencephaly (HMEG) and MCAP syndrome for early detection of cortical dysplasia, ventriculomegaly, and cerebellar tonsillar ectopia.

A cardiovascular assessment including a baseline echocardiogram and electrocardiogram to evaluate for cardiovascular malformations and rhythm abnormalities

A baseline renal ultrasound to evaluate for structural renal abnormalities

Surgical and orthopedic referrals for individuals suspected of having CLOVES syndrome or fibroadipose hyperplasia, and individuals with MCAP syndrome with focal somatic overgrowth or leg-length discrepancy
