To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), the following assessments are recommended:

Complete skin examination, including a biopsy of potentially lesional skin from the axilla or neck. A von Kossa or similar histologic stain for calcium should be done on the biopsy to confirm the diagnosis, although PXE can be strongly suspected on skin biopsy even without special stains.

Complete dilated eye examination by a retinal specialist, particularly looking for peau d'orange and angioid streaks. A fluorescein angiogram may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

Baseline cardiovascular examination with periodic follow-up for individuals with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), including (as clinically indicated based on age, physical findings, and exercise level):

Echocardiography

Cardiac stress testing

Doppler evaluation of peripheral vasculature
