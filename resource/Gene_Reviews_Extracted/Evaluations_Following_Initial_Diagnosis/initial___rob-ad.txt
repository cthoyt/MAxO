To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with autosomal dominant Robinow syndrome (ADRS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Radiographs of the limbs, chest, vertebrae and skull to establish the extent of skeletal involvement

Assessment for possible abnormal penile insertion/penoscrotal position for consideration of reconstructive surgery

Assessment for possible cryptorchidism

Clinical assessment for presence of cleft lip/palate and the need for surgical repair

Abdominal ultrasound examination for investigation of renal anomalies

Echocardiogram to evaluate for a cardiac defect

Endocrine consultation to assess the possibility of hormone therapy in the treatment of males with micropenis

Urology consultation in males with cryptorchidism and abnormal penile insertion/penoscrotal transposition for consideration of reconstructive surgery

Orthodontics consultation as needed for misaligned teeth or persistent primary dentition

Hearing assessment

Formal cognitive assessment if developmental delay is present

Medical genetics consultation
