Measurement of baseline plasma (serum) creatine kinase (CK) concentration

Measurement of baseline liver transaminases

Cardiac echocardiography

Electrocardiogram

Clinical genetics consultation

Note: In the setting of acute disease, measurement of blood glucose concentration and blood ammonia concentration may be indicated.
