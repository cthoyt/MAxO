To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with primary trimethylaminuria, it is recommended that the urinary ratio of trimethylamine (TMA) N-oxide to total TMA on a normal diet be determined. The general rule is that the lower the ratio the more severe the disorder:

Ratios of 70%-89% are classified as mild.

Ratios lower than 70% are classified as severe.

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor is also recommended.
