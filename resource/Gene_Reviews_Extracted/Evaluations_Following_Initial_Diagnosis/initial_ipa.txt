To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual with AIP-related FIPA, the following evaluations are recommended (for details see Katznelson et al [2011]; full text). Note: The evaluation may have to be individualized depending on the presentation.

Detailed personal history, including findings that may be consistent with the following:

A growth hormone-secreting tumor (stature in relation to the rest of the family, change in facial appearance, change in shoe size, problems with ring sizes, headache, excessive sweating, joint pains, carpal tunnel syndrome)

A prolactinoma (menstrual history, galactorrhea, infertility, low libido, impotence)

A non-functioning pituitary adenoma and mass effects (headache, lack of other pituitary hormones, visual field problems)

Thyrotropinoma (hyperthyroidism with non-suppressed TSH)

Corticotropinoma with Cushing disease (truncal obesity, striae, muscle weakness, thin skin, diabetes mellitus, hypertension)

Review of serial photographs over time to help identify the onset of acromegalic or cushingoid changes if present at the time of diagnosis

Measurement of parental heights

Clinical examination including measurement of height and documentation of presence or absence of features consistent with the endocrine disorders acromegaly, pituitary gigantism, Cushing disease, thyrotoxicosis

Visual field evaluation

Basal pituitary function including: spot GH, IGF-1; prolactin; LH, FSH, testosterone/estradiol; TSH, fT4; 9 a.m. cortisol

Glucose tolerance test (GTT) in persons with findings of acromegaly to identify abnormal GH dynamics. In addition, about 25% of persons with acromegaly have a diabetic GTT. Assess ACTH reserve if necessary.

In adults with acromegaly, colonoscopy at age 40 years with further surveillance at three- to ten-year intervals depending on the presence/absence of adenomas in the initial colonoscopy and IGF-1 levels [Cairns et al 2010]

Pituitary MRI to detect the size and extent of a tumor, if one is suspected

Consultation with specialists in endocrinology

Consultation with specialists in medical genetics to obtain detailed family history (of possible pituitary problems, unusual stature, fertility problems, and/or early death)
