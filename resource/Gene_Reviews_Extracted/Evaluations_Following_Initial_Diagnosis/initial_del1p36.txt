To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with 1p36 deletion syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended:

Measurements of growth parameters and plotting on standard growth charts Note: No growth charts are available specifically for 1p36 deletion syndrome.

Physical and neurologic examination

Evaluation of cognitive, language, and motor development and social skills

Examination of the heart (auscultation, electrocardiogram, echocardiography) in infancy

Waking/sleeping video-EEG-polygraphic studies (mainly in infancy) to detect infantile spasms with hypsarrhythmia

Evaluation for feeding problems and gastroesophageal reflux with referral to a dysphagia team

Ophthalmology consultation in infancy or at diagnosis even in the absence of overt anomalies

Physical examination for skeletal anomalies (e.g., scoliosis, lower-limb asymmetry); if anomalies are present, referral for orthopedic and physical therapy evaluation

Comprehensive otolaryngologic evaluation and audiologic screening (brain stem auditory evoked responses) as early as possible to allow appropriate interventions

Renal function testing and renal ultrasonography in infancy to detect structural renal anomalies

Periodic thyroid function screening

Clinical genetics consultation
