To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Rb, the following evaluations are recommended:

Prior to the planning of therapy, the extent of the tumor within and outside the eye should be determined. Each affected eye is assigned a classification, depending on the extent of disease and the risk that the cancer has spread outside the eye. Extent of the tumor is estimated by clinical examination under anesthetic and ultrasound or MRI, particularly focusing on the tumor-optic nerve relationship. Head MRI is also useful to evaluate for a pinealoblastoma, indicating trilateral retinoblastoma.

For very large tumors with risk factors for extraocular disease, bone marrow aspiration and examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may also be performed at diagnosis, or performed when pathologic examination of the enucleated eye reveals optic nerve invasion or significant risks for extraocular extension.

If Rb has spread outside the eye, the stage of cancer will need to be evaluated to determine the most appropriate care of the child.

In those individuals with a family history of Rb, and in uncommon circumstances in which the child presents with strabismus or poor vision, the retinal tumors may be small and detected on clinical examination under anesthesia.

Consultation with a medical geneticist and/or genetic counselor is indicated.
