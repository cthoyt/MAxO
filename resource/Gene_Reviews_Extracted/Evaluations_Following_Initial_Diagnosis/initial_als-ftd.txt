To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with C9orf72-related amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD), the following evaluations are recommended:

General medical history with emphasis on psychiatric illness [Devenney et al 2014] and problems potentially related to FTD such as alcohol or drug abuse

Family history with attention to dementia, ALS, or psychiatric illness, which are present in many C9orf72 heterozygotes [Devenney et al 2014]

Physical and clinical neurologic examination with attention to physical disability related to motor neuron disease

Neuropsychological examination to evaluate the extent and profile of cognitive disturbance

Electromyography in case of ALS and/or lower motor signs

Assessment of need for ancillary equipment such as walker, wheelchair, and/or respiratory assistance

Discussion of advanced care planning
