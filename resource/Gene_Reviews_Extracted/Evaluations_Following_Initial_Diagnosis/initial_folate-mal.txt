To establish the extent of disease and needs in a child diagnosed with hereditary folate malabsorption (HFM), the following evaluations are recommended:

Assessment by a pediatric neurologist to determine baseline neurologic status

Baseline (and follow-up) formal cognitive testing

Note: Appropriate monitoring of neurologic/cognitive response to treatment is recommended to ensure that the CSF folate levels achieved with treatment are adequate.

Initial evaluation and follow up by a metabolic genetic specialist
