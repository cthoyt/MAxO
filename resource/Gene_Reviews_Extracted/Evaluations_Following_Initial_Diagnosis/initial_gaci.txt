To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI), the following evaluations are recommended:

Medical genetics consultation

Physical examination with particular attention to blood pressure and peripheral pulses, as well as presence of bowing of the long bones (i.e., evidence of autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets)

Metabolic workup including serum creatinine, serum phosphorus, urine phosphorus, urine creatinine, and alkaline phosphatase to evaluate for evidence of hypophosphatemic rickets by measuring the tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TRP) and the ratio of the renal tubular maximum reabsorption rate of phosphate to the glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR)

Serum levels of cardiac-specific troponin T or troponin I to evaluate for evidence of ischemia

Pediatric cardiology consultation including:

ECG to assess for signs of left ventricular hypertrophy or ischemia

Echocardiogram to monitor left ventricular systolic function and to assess for the presence of calcifications, left ventricular hypertrophy, or pericardial effusion

CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis (if possible with runoff to lower extremities) to evaluate the extent and distribution of vascular calcification

Skeletal survey to assess for either periarticular calcification or findings typical of rickets such as widening of the growth plate, bowing of the long bones, or metaphyseal widening, cupping, or fraying. Include cervical films to evaluate for cervical spine fusion.

Audiologic assessment for conductive or sensorineural hearing loss

Pediatric nephrology consultation in the setting of refractory hypertension
