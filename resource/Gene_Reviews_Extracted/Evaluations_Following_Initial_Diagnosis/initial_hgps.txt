To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Weight and height plotted on standard growth charts to evaluate growth over time

Baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram

Baseline carotid artery duplex scans to evaluate size of the lumen and intimal thickness in order to establish baseline vascular status

Baseline MRI/MRA of the brain and neck

Skeletal x-ray to evaluate for characteristic findings: acroosteolysis, clavicular resorption, coxa valga, and extraskeletal soft tissue calcifications [Cleveland et al 2012]

Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) to assess bone mineral density. Note: This must be normalized for height-age [Gordon et al 2011].

Standard goniometry to assess joint mobility; physical therapy and occupational therapy assessments

Nutritional assessment

Audiologic, ophthalmologic, and dental examinations

Clinical genetics consultation
