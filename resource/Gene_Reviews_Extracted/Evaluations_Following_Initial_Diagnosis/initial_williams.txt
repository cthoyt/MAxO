To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Williams syndrome (WS), and to guide medical management, the following evaluations are recommended [Committee on Genetics 2001, Committee on Genetics 2002]:

Complete physical and neurologic examination

Plotting of growth parameters on Williams syndrome growth charts

Cardiology evaluation

Full clinical evaluation by a cardiologist with experience in treating WS

Measurement of blood pressure in all four limbs

Echocardiogram, including Doppler flow studies

Electrocardiogram

Additional cardiovascular imaging studies (computed tomography, magnetic resonance angiography, or cardiac catheterization) may be required in individuals with diminished pulses, bruits, or signs of diffuse thoracic aortic stenosis.

Urinary system evaluation

Ultrasound examination of the bladder and kidneys

Serum concentration of BUN and creatinine

Urinalysis

Calcium determinations

Serum concentration of calcium or ionized calcium

Calcium/creatinine determination on a spot urine sample (See Sargent et al [1993] for normal values.)

Thyroid function tests

Ophthalmologic evaluation

Baseline audiologic evaluation

Multidisciplinary developmental evaluation, including assessment of motor, speech, language, personal-social, general cognitive, and vocational skills

Assessment of behavior including attention, anxiety, and adaptive skills

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
