To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with COL1A1/2-related osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), the following evaluations are recommended:

Physical examination to assess deformities and presence of joint laxity

Hearing assessed through formal audiology

Screening for basilar impression, best performed by CT and/or MRI scanning with views across the base of the skull. There is no universal agreement on when screening for basilar impression should be done; currently, it is recommended on the basis of concerning signs or symptoms on annual physical examination or on reported symptoms by the affected individual.

Cervical spine flexion and extension radiographs, obtained when children are able to cooperate with the examination or prior to participating in sporting activities in more mildly affected individuals

Dental evaluation by age two to three years for all children with OI and at the time that teeth erupt in those with DI or at risk for DI

Clinical genetics consultation
