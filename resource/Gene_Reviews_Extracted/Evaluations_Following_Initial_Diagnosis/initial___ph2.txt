To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with primary hyperoxaluria type 2 (PH2), the following evaluations are recommended [Leumann & Hoppe 2001]:

Assessment of renal function

If moderate to advanced ESRD is present, assessment of systemic oxalate deposition in tissue and bone:

Bone x-rays to look for radiodense metaphyseal bands

Ophthalmic examination of the retina to look for oxalate crystals

Evaluation of cardiac function by echocardiography
