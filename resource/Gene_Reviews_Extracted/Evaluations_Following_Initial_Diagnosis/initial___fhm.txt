To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with familial or sporadic hemiplegic migraine, the following evaluations are recommended:

Quantitative eye movement examination in individuals with nystagmus or complaints of incoordination or imbalance to look for additional clues of cerebellar involvement

EEG and neuroimaging studies if seizures are present in order to further characterize the seizure disorder.

Consultation with a medical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
