To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with mucolipidosis III alpha/beta (ML III alpha/beta), the following evaluations are recommended:

Radiographic skeletal survey if either not performed or incomplete in the diagnostic evaluation

Baseline evaluations with an orthopedic surgeon and a metabolic bone specialist to better determine if/when surgical interventions or bisphosphonate therapy may be initiated (see Treatment of Manifestations)

Cardiac evaluation with echocardiography to assess valve thickening and ventricular size and function

Baseline ophthalmologic examination

Hearing screen

Developmental assessment to help establish appropriate expectations for the childâ€™s developmental progress

Clinical genetics consultation
