To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC), the following evaluations are recommended:

Assessment of ability to walk and transfer, manage secretions, and communicate (language, speech, and hearing)

For individuals with hepatosplenomegaly, complete blood count and tests of hepatic function

MRI of the head; usually performed in the course of the workup and usually normal until the disease is advanced

Consideration of EEG and sleep studies if the history suggests seizures or sleep disturbances

Clinical genetics consultation
