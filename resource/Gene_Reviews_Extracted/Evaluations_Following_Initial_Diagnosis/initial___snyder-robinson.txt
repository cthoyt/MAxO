To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Snyder-Robinson syndrome (SRS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Intellectual disability (ID) assessment using standardized neuropsychological tests to determine overall level of cognitive function as well as relative levels of performance and verbal skills. These assessments help guide recommendations for educational resources and special therapies.

Neuropsychological assessment (visual, speech, or motor function)

Bone density assessment by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan to determine the degree of osteoporosis and the need for and response to calcium supplements

Assessment of seizures, including EEG if seizures are suspected. The type of seizures may determine the selection of anticonvulsant.

Clinical genetics consultation

MRI of the brain to assess abnormal calcification (which has been noted in a few individuals and occurs in the absence of calcium supplementation)
