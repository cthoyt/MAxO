To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) or later-onset CCHS (LO-CCHS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Assessment in a pediatric respiratory physiology laboratory, with:

Clinical study of spontaneous breathing awake and asleep including (at a minimum) tidal volume, respiratory inductance plethysmography of the chest and abdomen, hemoglobin saturation with pulse waveform, end-tidal carbon dioxide level with visible waveform, and electrocardiogram; and

Evaluation of the awake and asleep responses to exogenous and endogenous challenges of hypercarbia and/or hypoxemia.

Venous or arterial blood gas or serum bicarbonate level to look for elevated carbon dioxide content at the time of presentation

Hemoglobin, hematocrit, and reticulocyte count to assess for polycythemia

72-hour Holter recording to assess for abrupt, prolonged asystoles

Echocardiogram to assess for changes consistent with right ventricular hypertrophy and cor pulmonale

Neurocognitive assessment to determine baseline function

Comprehensive autonomic testing of all organ systems regulated by the ANS, including but not limited to pupillometry, head up-tilt testing, thermoregulatory chamber sweat testing, Q-Sweat testing, heart rate deep breathing, Valsalva maneuver, and measures of regional blood flow in activities of daily living as well as orthostatic testing.

Clinical genetics consultation

See Table 4 for additional details.
