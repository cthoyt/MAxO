To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with EPB42-related hereditary spherocytosis (EPB42-HS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Hemoglobin concentration and reticulocyte count to evaluate severity of disease

Serum bilirubin concentration

Transfusion history

Serum ferritin concentration to evaluate iron load status

Abdominal ultrasound examination to evaluate:

Spleen size if physical examination is not conclusive due to body habitus or if contact sports are contemplated

For evidence of cholelithiasis when symptoms are present. If hemolysis is significant a screening ultrasound may be considered after age 10-12 years, even without symptoms.

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
