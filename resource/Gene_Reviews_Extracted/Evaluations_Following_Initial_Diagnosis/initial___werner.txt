To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Werner syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended:

Screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus by standard clinical assays including fasting glucose level, hemoglobin A1c, or oral glucose tolerance test

Lipid profile

Physical examination for cancers common in Werner syndrome (e.g., thyroid nodules, skin tumors)

Ophthalmologic examination including slit lamp examination

Skin examination for common findings, especially early ulcerations of the feet, with special attention to nail beds and soles of feet for lentiginous melanoma

Head MRI if neurologic symptoms including new-onset seizures, focal neurologic signs such as weakness or visual field defect, or symptoms such as diploplia or headache are present. These can be indicative of meningioma, a common neoplasm in Werner syndrome.

Assessment of coping and psychological fitness in light of prognosis

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Infants with Werner syndrome are unaffected at birth; thus, no special precautions or investigations are recommended in the neonatal period.
