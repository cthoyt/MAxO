To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Physical examination with special attention to growth parameters, congenital anomalies, and neurologic findings (hypotonia/hypertonia, seizures)

Developmental assessment

Ophthalmologic evaluation for strabismus, cataracts, and functional eye problems

Cardiac evaluation (ECG and echocardiogram) for congenital defects

Musculoskeletal evaluation for delineation of syndactyly, polydactyly, abnormalities of tone, and need for ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) or other orthotics

Genitourinary examination for anomalies of external genitalia in males and females

Evaluation for functional problems of the gastrointestinal system by history and, if indicated, studies for pyloric stenosis and gastroesophageal reflux. Particular attention should also be given to stooling pattern, abdominal distention, or other signs of possible bowel obstruction, particularly in children with a more severe phenotype, because of their risk for Hirschsprung disease.

Nutritional assessment for feeding problems and poor weight gain

Possible MRI or other cranial imaging to evaluate for holoprosencephaly and/or other brain anomalies

Renal ultrasound evaluation for renal anomalies

Hearing evaluation for either sensorineural or conductive hearing loss

Laboratory evaluation including glucose and electrolytes (for adrenal insufficiency), serum concentrations of amino transferases and bilirubin (for cholestatic liver disease), and testosterone in males

Clinical genetics consultation
