To establish the extent of disease and the needs of an individual diagnosed with oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), the following evaluations are recommended:

Evaluation for swallowing difficulties by history and in more severe cases with a videoendoscopic swallowing study (VESS) and/or videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) [Dodds et al 1990, Langmore et al 1991, St Guily et al 1995, Périé et al 1998].

VESS gives indirect signs of upper esophageal sphincter (UES) dysfunction

VFSS gives a direct evaluation of the UES using radiopaque barite in the tracheobronchial tree

The drink test, a global quantitative functional evaluation of swallowing, is abnormal when it takes longer than seven seconds to drink 80 mL of ice-cold water [Bouchard et al 1992, Brais et al 1995]. Questionnaires can also be used to evaluate the degree of dysphagia (i.e., the Mc Horney score [McHorney et al 2002] and the Salassa grade [Salassa 1999].

Neuromuscular examination performed by a neurologist to determine overall disease progression and the presence (and severity) of ptosis, dysphagia, proximal weakness, and the presence or absence of any other neurologic findings

Consideration of muscle biopsy in those cases with more severe or complicated presentations

Medical genetics consultation
