To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy (BSCL), the following clinical evaluations are recommended:

Complete blood count

Serum concentration of electrolytes, AST, alanine transaminase, urea, creatinine, insulin, C-peptide, triglycerides, and cholesterol

Oral glucose tolerance test; when appropriate, clamp glucose homeostasis study

Ultrasound of the liver to evaluate liver size and fatty content

Echocardiogram to evaluate for cardiac hypertrophy

Renal ultrasound examination to evaluate for kidney size

Physical examination for orthopedic complications including reduced hip mobility and genu valgum

Skeletal survey, especially of the long bones, to evaluate for bone cysts

Bone age and assessment of sexual maturity rating/pubertal status

Complete ophthalmologic examination, including slit lamp examination, to evaluate for ophthalmologic complications due to hyperlipemia and/or diabetes mellitus

Assessment of cognitive ability with age-appropriate scales

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
