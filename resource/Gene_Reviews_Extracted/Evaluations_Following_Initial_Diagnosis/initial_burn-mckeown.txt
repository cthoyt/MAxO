To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Burn-McKeown syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended:

In newborns, airway assessment for evidence of upper-airway obstruction with choanal stenosis/atresia

Ophthalmology assessment for lower-eyelid coloboma for possible corneal involvement

Audiology assessment (see Deafness and Hereditary Hearing Loss Overview)

Examination for midline cleft palate or unilateral cleft lip/palate; referral to multidisciplinary cleft palate team as required

Cardiology and/or echocardiographic assessment for structural heart defects

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
