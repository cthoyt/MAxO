To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) the following evaluations are recommended:

Full clinical history and examination, including neurologic evaluation if symptomatic

Review of medications to assess risk versus benefit (see Agents/Circumstances to Avoid)

Quantitation of urine porphobilinogen excretion to establish a baseline for comparison with future measurements taken during symptoms suggestive of active porphyria

Referral to a porphyria specialist for more detailed clinical advice on AIP

Referral to clinical genetics for counseling
