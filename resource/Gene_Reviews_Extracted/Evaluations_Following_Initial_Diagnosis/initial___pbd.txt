To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with peroxisome biogenesis disorders, Zellweger syndrome spectrum (PBD, ZSS), evaluations of the following are recommended:

Feeding

Hearing

Vision (comprehensive ophthalmologic assessment)

Note: Electroretinogram (ERG) and visual field testing are useful in the diagnosis of retinal dystrophy.

Liver function

Neurologic function (possible MRI of the brain and EEG)

Development

Possible endocrine evaluation of adrenal function as adrenal insufficiency may occur during periods of stress
