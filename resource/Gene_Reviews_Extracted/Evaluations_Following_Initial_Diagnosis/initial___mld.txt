To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with arylsulfatase A deficiency (MLD), the following evaluations are recommended:

If the diagnosis is made presymptomatically, baseline measures of ARSA enzyme activity, urinary sulfatide excretion, and myelin integrity by MRI to monitor disease progression and evaluate the need for possible intervention

Baseline assessment of development/cognitive abilities and behavior to monitor disease progression or changes with attempted therapy

Examination of the peripheral nervous system

Clinical genetics consultation
