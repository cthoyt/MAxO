To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with SUCLA2-related mtDNA depletion syndrome, the following evaluations need to be performed (if not already done as part of the initial diagnostic evaluation):

Comprehensive neurologic examination and developmental/cognitive assessment. The following diagnostic modalities can be used to assess the degree of neurologic involvement:

Neuroimaging (preferably brain MRI) to establish the degree of central nervous system involvement

EMG to assess myopathy

EEG if seizures are suspected

Audiology evaluation

Ophthalmologic examination

Nutritional evaluation and swallowing assessment for feeding difficulties and growth failure

Physical examination for the back and joints for kyphoscoliosis and joint contractures

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
