To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with lipoid proteinosis (LP), the following are recommended:

Consultation with a dermatologist (or pediatric dermatologist)

Consultation with an otolaryngologist if vocal cord infiltration leads to airway obstruction, recurrent upper respiratory infections, and/or impaired speech

Evaluation for evidence of seizures if clinical findings are suggestive

Evaluation for neuropsychiatric manifestations

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
