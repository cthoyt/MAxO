To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), evaluation should include the following:

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Tests looking for evidence of infection, such as C reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), which are sensitive but non-specific markers of inflammation

Complete blood count (CBC). Anemia is common either due to anemia of chronic disease or iron deficiency anemia. Poor iron absorption is common in CGD-related colitis.

Albumin. Hypoalbuminemia is found in 70% of persons with GI involvement and in 25% of persons without GI manifestations [Marciano et al 2004].

Endoscopy and colonoscopy if signs and symptoms of colitis are present

Imaging as it pertains to specific symptoms for diagnosis and management of infection. Because CGD can affect almost every organ system different imaging modalities can be used depending on the site affected. Because of its relative ease and sensitivity, CT scan is often used; however, ultrasound and MRI can be used instead in many instances. Positron emission tomography (PET) using fluorine-18-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) uptake can help discriminate active from resolved infection. High FDG uptake is consistent with active inflammation [Güngör et al 2001].

Affected Organs / Manifestations of CGD on Imaging

Lungs / pneumonia [Godoy et al 2008]

Chest x-ray. Consolidation, reticular nodular opacities, scarring

CT

Consolidation, ground-glass opacity, tree-in-bud opacity, centrilobular or random nodules, septal thickening, air trapping, scarring

Empyema or abscess

Mediastinal or hilar adenopathy, honeycomb lung, pleural thickening in chronic cases

Contiguous spread to chest wall, associated osteomyelitis of ribs and vertebral bodies

Lymph nodes / suppurative adenitis [Towbin & Chaves 2010]

CT. Enhancing lymph node with central area of hypodensity and enhancing septations

US

Swirling debris, thickened septa, and increased color Doppler flow

Calcifications if granuloma present

Liver / abscess [Garcia-Eulate et al 2006]

Single to multiple small or large abscesses, sharply defined; variable enhancement but usually with small central area with poor enhancement

Calcifications

Musculoskeletal / osteomyelitis [Galluzzo et al 2008]

Multifocal, occurring in ribs, vertebral bodies, small bones of hands and feet

Genitourinary / cystitis [Walther et al 1992]

Inflammatory pseudotumors of the bladder; on US appear as focal wall thickening

Gastrointestinal / obstruction and colitis [Marciano et al 2004, Laskey et al 2009]

Obstruction

Esophagus: strictures, diverticula, dysmotility

Thickening of bowel wall, fistulae

Upper GI: gastric outlet obstruction with gastric dilation, delayed gastric emptying, circumferential antral narrowing, thickened gastric folds

Gastric wall thickening on US, CT, or MRI

Colitis: Bowel wall thickening, skip lesions, luminal narrowing, fistulae, cobblestone mucosal pattern

Head and neck / sinusitis [Towbin & Chaves 2010]

MRI. Fungal sinusitis hypointense on T1 and T2-weighted images, associated with bony destruction

CT. Fungal sinusitis hyperdense

Central nervous system / abscess [Towbin & Chaves 2010]

Abscesses with typical appearance on MRI with ring-enhancing lesions
