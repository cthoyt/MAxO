To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) deficiency, the following evaluations are recommended:

Carnitine levels. Total and free carnitine levels can be used to detect free carnitine deficiency; however, carnitine levels are usually normal in individuals with SCAD deficiency.

Urine organic acids; used to detect ethylmalonic acid (EMA) during acute illnesses

Clinical genetics consultation
