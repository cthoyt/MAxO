Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 After an individual has been diagnosed with esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal fistula (EA/TEF), the following evaluations should be considered as a means of identifying associated anomalies: X-ray evaluation for vertebral anomalies Echocardiogram Renal ultrasound examination

Treatment of Manifestations

 Initial postnatal intervention, aimed at minimizing the risk of aspiration pneumonia, typically includes the elimination of oral feeds, placement of a suction catheter to allow continuous drainage of secretions, and elevation of the head of the bed to minimize reflux [Clark 1999]. Intravenous (IV) glucose and fluids should be provided; supplemental oxygen should be administered as needed. When intubation cannot be avoided, a possible complication is the collection of air in the stomach, which in severe cases can only be removed by gastrostomy. Surgical repair consists of closure of the TEF and anastomosis of the esophageal segments [Sharma & Duerksen 2012]. Surgical repair may need to be delayed in infants with low birth weight, pneumonia, or other major congenital anomalies. When surgical repair is delayed, infants may be treated with parenteral nutrition, gastrostomy tube placement, and upper pouch suctioning until they become surgical candidates. The most common complications after surgical repair include leakage at the site of the anastomosis, recurrent fistula, structure formation, and gastroesophageal reflux [Clark 1999, Sharma & Duerksen 2012, Kronemer & Snyder-Warwick 2013].
