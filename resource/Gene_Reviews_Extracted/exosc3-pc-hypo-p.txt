Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis 

To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with EXOSC3-related pontocerebellar hypoplasia, the following are recommended: Optionally to evaluate disease progress: neurologic evaluation (EMG, NCV) and brain MRI. Pediatric evaluation, including assessment of feeding, pulmonary function, and nutritional status Ophthalmologic examination including fundoscopy to assess the optic nerve and measurement of visual acuity. Orthopedic evaluation to assess joint contractures and scoliosis. Electroencephalography in those with suspected liability of seizures Medical genetics consultation, including counseling and prenatal advice regarding future pregnancies and counseling of related family members.

Treatment of Manifestations

No specific therapy is available. Treatment is symptomatic. The main problems to manage are: Contractures, including scoliosis, due to neurogenic atrophy, by passive or active movement and if necessary by bracing. Prevention of aspiration due to bulbar muscle and respiratory muscle involvement Adaptation of education to the level of cognitive handicap Epilepsy, which is amendable to standard treatments

Surveillance

Regular examinations to address: Growth and nutritional status, including problems with feeding and risk of aspiration Respiratory function Joint contractures and scoliosis Development or management of epileptic seizures

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk
