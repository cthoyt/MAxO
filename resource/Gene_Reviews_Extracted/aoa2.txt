Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2), the following evaluations are recommended: Assessment of cognitive function Examination of cranial nerve function Neurologic examination including assessment of gait and limb ataxia, coordination, tone, strength, reflexes, and sensory perception Ophthalmologic examination Clinical genetics consultation Physical therapy and occupational therapy assessment of strength and balance Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) concentration, if not evaluated previously

Treatment of Manifestations

Physical therapy may be helpful, particularly for disabilities resulting from peripheral neuropathy. A wheelchair is usually necessary for mobility by age 30 years. Educational support (e.g., use of a computer with speech recognition and special keyboard for typing) should be provided to compensate for difficulties in reading (caused by oculomotor apraxia) and in writing (caused by upper-limb ataxia).

Prevention of Secondary Complications

A low-cholesterol diet is advised.

Surveillance

Routine visits to the attending neurologist are indicated.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
