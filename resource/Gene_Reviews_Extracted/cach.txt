Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with childhood ataxia with central nervous system hypomyelination/vanishing white matter disease (CACH/VWM), the following evaluations are recommended: Brain MRI Ophthalmologic examination Neurologic examination Physical therapy/occupational therapy assessment as needed Clinical genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations

 The following are appropriate: Physical therapy and rehabilitation for motor dysfunction (mainly spasticity and ataxia) Ankle-foot orthotics in individuals with hypotonia and weakness of ankle dorsiflexors Antiepileptic drugs for treatment of seizures and abnormalities of behavior and mood

Prevention of Secondary Complications

 Considering the known adverse effect of fever, it is important to prevent infections and fever as much as possible (e.g., through the use of vaccinations, including anti-flu vaccination); low-dose maintenance antibiotics during winter time, antibiotics for minor infections, and antipyretics for fever are appropriate. For children, wearing a helmet outside helps minimize the effects of possible head trauma.

Surveillance

 Close surveillance for several days following head trauma or major surgical procedure with anesthesia is indicated because neurologic deterioration (presumably stress related) may follow.

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid

 Avoid the following: Contact sports and other activities with a high risk of head trauma Stressful emotional and physical situations (e.g., extreme temperatures)

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Therapies Under Investigation

 Search ClinicalTrials.gov for access to information on clinical studies for a wide range of diseases and conditions. Note: There may not be clinical trials for this disorder.

Other

 In general, corticosteriods and intravenous gamma globulin are not effective in the treatment of CACH/VWM. Corticosteriods have been used with inconsistent results in acute situations, including intractable status epilepticus.
