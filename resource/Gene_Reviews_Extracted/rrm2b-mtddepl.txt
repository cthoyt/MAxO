Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with RRM2B-related mitochondrial disease, the following evaluations are recommended: Comprehensive clinical examination and neurology consultation that includes measures of functional neurologic status Formal developmental evaluation (particularly in a child with the encephalomyopathic form with renal tubulopathy) Formal assessment of vision and hearing Brain MRI and electroencephalogram (EEG) in individuals with encephalopathy and/or seizures. Note: these may be normal with certain RRM2B-related mitochondrial disease phenotypes. Nutritional assessment Speech and language assessment Physical therapy assessment Occupational therapy assessment Pulmonary function testing For those with Kearns-Sayre syndrome, cardiac evaluation to include electrocardiogram (ECG) and/or echocardiogram Clinical genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations

Detailed evaluations are outlined in Wellcome Trust Centre for Mitochondrial Research Clinical Guidelines. To date, there are no known cures and few effective treatments for any forms of mitochondrial disease, including RRM2B-related mitochondrial disease. Treatment modalities currently focus on symptomatic management and supportive care, and are best implemented by a multidisciplinary team. General management guidelines for those with systemic involvement: Nutritional support (e.g., nasogastric tube, gastrostomy) as needed for significant gastrointestinal involvement Early referral to a pediatric renal specialist for those with proximal renal tubulopathy Early referral to a pediatric pulmonologist for children with evidence of reduced respiratory function. Management may include consideration of tracheostomy and artificial ventilation. Physical therapy to maintain muscle strength and mobility and to prevent contractures Referral to a pediatric neurologist for seizure management. Of note, seizures may be refractory to treatment. Referral to hearing loss specialists to determine the best habilitation options for sensorineural hearing loss (see Hereditary Hearing Loss and Deafness for discussion of management issues) General management guidelines for those with progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO): Ptosis surgery for cosmesis and/or symptomatic relief in those with good residual orbicularis oculi muscle strength ECG in all individuals with PEO to screen for significant cardiac conduction defects which may warrant placement of a pacemaker, particularly in those with the Kearns-Sayre syndrome phenotype General management guidelines for both those with systemic involvement and those with PEO: Aggressive management of fever and infection

Surveillance

No clinical guidelines specific to RRM2B-related mitochondrial disease are available; however, detailed evaluations are outlined in Wellcome Trust Centre for Mitochondrial Research Clinical Guidelines. The following evaluations should be considered: 
RRM2B-related mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (encephalo-myopathic form with renal tubulopathy) Regular assessments of neurodevelopment, speech, and language Regular evaluations by a pediatric neurologist to evaluate for the presence and/or severity of encephalopathy, with consideration of EEG and video EEG monitoring to determine presence of seizures and/or subclinical status epilepticus Regular evaluation by a pediatric renal specialist, including assessment of renal function (electrolytes in blood and urine and urine analysis) Routine assessment of nutritional status, growth, and body mass index (BMI) Regular pulmonary function testing including monitoring of blood gases for early detection of respiratory compromise 
RRM2B-related mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome and mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy Biannual: Comprehensive neurology consultation and clinical examination to include measures of functional neurologic status Occupational therapy and physical therapy assessments CBC, electrolytes, liver function (albumin, coagulation factors), liver enzymes (AST, ALT, GGT), blood glucose, and HBA1C Annual pulmonary function testing including assessment of blood gases to monitor for early respiratory compromise Routine assessment of nutritional status, weight gain, and BMI, including regular review with speech and language therapist with consideration of gastrostomy as needed for nutritional support Imaging and diagnostic procedures including EEG, ECG, and brain MRI as indicated by clinical findings and rate of disease progression 
RRM2B-related multiple mtDNA deletions with external ophthalmoplegia Care will be directed by clinical findings. The following general evaluations are recommended: Biannual: Comprehensive neurology consultation and clinical examination to include measures of functional neurologic status Occupational therapy and physical therapy assessments CBC, electrolytes, liver function (albumin, coagulation factors), liver enzymes (AST, ALT, GGT), blood glucose, and HBA1C Annual pulmonary function testing including assessment of blood gases to monitor for early respiratory compromise Routine assessment of nutritional status, weight gain and BMI, biannually Imaging and diagnostic procedures to include EEG, ECG, and MRI brain- as indicated by clinical findings and rate of disease progression ECG advised biannually (KSS phenotype)

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid

Avoid the following: Valproic acid (commonly used for seizures and known to interfere with beta-oxidation) because it is considered to be a mitochondrial toxin with a theoretic risk of precipitating/exacerbating organ failure Metformin (used to treat diabetes mellitus) because of the theoretic risk of exacerbating metabolic acidosis Prolonged use of linezolid (an antibiotic used to treat S. aureus infections) because of the reported association with optic and peripheral neuropathy and lactic acidosis due to mitochondrial toxicity Zidovudine (an antiretroviral nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase used to treat HIV) because of the reported risk of inducing mitochondrial disease by interfering with mtDNA replication Dehydration and prolonged fasting, which can lead to clinical deterioration

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

If the pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member, it is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives so that those who harbor the pathogenic variant(s) can (1) undergo timely routine surveillance for disease complications and (2) avoid possible precipitating factors. See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
