Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis 

To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with hypomyelination and congenital cataract (HCC), the following evaluations are recommended: Ophthalmologic examination Neurologic examination Developmental assessment Medical genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations

Cataract extraction, usually in the first months of life, is indicated. Supportive therapy includes the following: Physical therapy to improve motor function Special education Antiepileptic drugs if epileptic seizures are present

Prevention of Secondary Complications

Although primary treatment is not possible, management of symptoms can improve the care of these patients. A multidisciplinary approach is advisable to prevent: Spasticity: pharmacologic agents, physical therapy Ataxia: rehabilitation Seizures: anticonvulsants Cognitive developmental delay: tailored approach at school or at work Orthopedic: prevention/treatment of orthopedic problems, such as contractures and scoliosis Feeding: swallowing surveillance and gastrostomy if needed

Surveillance

Surveillance includes periodic: Neurologic evaluation to identify neurologic complications; Evaluation by a physiatrist to aid with assistive devices as needed; Eye examination if cataracts were not identified in the neonatal period.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
