Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with the 1q21.1 recurrent microdeletion, the following evaluations should be considered: Ophthalmologic examination if there are concerns about vision Cardiac evaluation if there are suggestive features clinically or on physical examination Brain imaging if microcephaly, macrocephaly, and/or neurologic findings are present Renal ultrasound examination Comprehensive developmental assessment for motor and language delays, which may include evaluations for autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disability, ADHD, and hearing loss Neurology consultation if significant hypotonia, seizures, tics, or tremors are present Psychiatric evaluation if evidence of mental illness is present Consultation with a medical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Treatment of Manifestations

 The following are indicated: Routine treatment of ophthalmologic, cardiac, and neurologic findings Speech, occupational, and physical therapies, as appropriate Specialized learning programs to meet individual needs No specific antiepileptic or antipsychotic medications are indicated.

Surveillance

 Appropriate surveillance includes the following: Routine pediatric care Routine developmental and learning assessments Monitoring of any specific medical issues that are identified

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 Using genomic testing that will detect the 1q21.1 recurrent microdeletion found in the proband, it is appropriate to evaluate the sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from close assessment/monitoring of developmental milestones in childhood. See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
