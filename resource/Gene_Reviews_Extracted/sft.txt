Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease in a person diagnosed with sialuria, the following evaluations are recommended, if they have not already been completed. Note: The priority of these recommendations depends on the signs observed in the patient and/or noted by the parents: CBC with differential to evaluate for microcytic anemia Measurement of serum bilirubin concentration to evaluate for jaundice Skeletal survey to evaluate for dysostosis multiplex Developmental and neurologic assessment EEG when relevant Neuroimaging with the purpose of differentiating sialuria from neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorders

Treatment of Manifestations

 Persons with sialuria need symptomatic and supportive management, including treatment of anemia, prolonged but mild jaundice, and convulsions. Barbiturates have been more effective in treating the occasional convulsion in early childhood than other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Affected individuals benefit from early developmental intervention and appropriate educational programs.

Prevention of Secondary Complications

 Appropriate antibiotics to prevent secondary bacterial super-infection in the upper/lower airways are indicated.

Surveillance

 The following are appropriate: Clinical follow-up during and after infancy to confirm that CNS disease is not progressive (in contrast to free sialic acid storage disorders) and to document the gradual remission of signs and/or symptoms present in infancy Follow-up evaluations three to four times in infancy, twice in the second year of life, and once every subsequent year

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk
