Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with Caffey disease, the following evaluations are recommended: Evaluation for joint range of motion, tissue hyperlaxity, and hernias Radiographs of long bones, ribs, scapulae, clavicles, and mandible to assess extent of disease and the stage of hyperostosis Clinical genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations

 Anti-inflammatory agents, antipyretics, and analgesics can be used in the short term to decrease swelling and fever and to relieve pain [Thometz & DiRaimondo 1996, Parnell & Parisi 2010]. Although immunoglobulins have also been tried [Berthier et al 1988], no definitive treatment guidelines exist. No recommendations for the prevention of recurrence of hyperostosis currently exist.

Surveillance

 Currently, no standard surveillance protocols exist. However, given that Caffey disease is a collagenopathy, yearly evaluation of stature, joint extensibility, hernias, fracture history, and dental health is recommended. Although no systematic reviews of bone mineral density in adults with the defining pathogenic variant have been performed, reports of fractures and short stature in adults with other COL1A1 pathogenic variants suggest that assessment of bone mineral density may be prudent in adults with a history of Caffey disease in childhood.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

 No special recommendations for management of either a fetus known to be heterozygous for the disease-defining pathogenic variant or a mother known to have had Caffey disease in childhood.
