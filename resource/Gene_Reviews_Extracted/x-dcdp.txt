Management

No published guidelines exist to establish the extent of disease or proper management in an individual with X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata 2 (CDPX2). The following recommendations are based on current literature and the authorsâ€™ experience.

Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

Physical examination with attention to growth parameters, skin, hair, and skeleton, as well as possible internal malformations (CNS, cardiac, renal) Full skeletal survey and orthopedic evaluation to assess limb length differences, kyphoscoliosis, and other skeletal abnormalities, including polydactyly Pulmonary evaluation, if scoliosis compromises respiratory function Dermatologic evaluation to exclude other causes of the phenotype Ophthalmologic evaluation for congenital cataracts and other eye abnormalities Developmental assessment (after the newborn period) Echocardiogram for possible congenital heart defect at the time of diagnosis Renal ultrasound examination for possible kidney anomalies Hearing evaluation to detect hearing loss

Treatment of Manifestations

Treatment is symptomatic and should be tailored to each patient. For females with typical CDPX2 diagnosed in the newborn period: Orthopedic management of leg length discrepancy; surgical correction of polydactyly; frequent assessment of kyphoscoliosis, which can progress rapidly at any age Cataract extraction and correction of vision Dermatologic management of skin lesions Physical, occupational, and speech therapies, if necessary Standard interventions for congenital heart defects, kidney anomalies, and hearing loss

Surveillance

Appropriate surveillance includes: Regular follow-up of ophthalmologic abnormalities Regular orthopedic evaluations to monitor kyphoscoliosis or joint problems and assess linear growth and any leg length discrepancy Ongoing developmental assessments Ongoing follow-up with dermatologist Routine monitoring of any existing cardiac and/or renal abnormalities Regular hearing evaluations

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk
