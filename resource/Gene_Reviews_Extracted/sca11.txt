Treatment of Manifestations

 The following are appropriate: Speech and language therapy to address dysarthria and swallowing problems and to teach patients strategies to improve their articulation and to avoid aspiration Occupational therapy, including home adaptations Physiotherapy and assessment for cane and wheelchair Ankle-foot orthotics (AFOs) for those with neuropathy Ophthalmology consultation is often helpful for individuals with nystagmus as prism glasses can help double vision

Prevention of Secondary Complications
