Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with the 17q12 recurrent duplication, the following evaluations are recommended: General clinical examination Assessment by neurodevelopmental pediatrician and/or clinical psychologist/psychiatrist to determine extent of delays Evaluation by a neurologist if neurologic features are present or there is suspicion of seizures Ophthalmologic evaluation Echocardiogram Renal ultrasound examination Consultation with gastroenterologist and/or feeding team for GI concerns, suspected dysphagia, or feeding difficulties Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Treatment of Manifestations

Treatment should be tailored to the specific needs of the individual. Those with developmental delays, cognitive disability, behavioral problems, or psychological phenotypes (autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia) should be evaluated by a neurodevelopmental pediatrician or clinical psychologist/psychiatrist for treatment recommendations. Seizures should be managed by a neurologist using standard practice. Individuals with cardiac, ophthalmic, or renal abnormalities should be managed by the appropriate specialist.

Surveillance

Regular assessment of psychomotor development is recommended for all children with the 17q12 recurrent duplication. Referral to an early intervention program will likely be of considerable benefit.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

It is appropriate to employ genetic testing to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband previously found to have the 17q12 recurrent duplication in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from close assessment/monitoring of developmental milestones in childhood or psychological issues through adulthood. See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
