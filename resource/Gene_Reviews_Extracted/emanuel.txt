Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

No current guidelines to evaluate the clinical manifestations that contribute to morbidity and mortality have been published. The following measures ‒ based on the literature and the authors' experience ‒ are recommended (if they have not already been completed) to establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Emanuel syndrome: Palatal evaluation for cleft palate Cardiac evaluation with an echocardiogram to screen for cardiac defects. Atrial septal defects are the most common defects and may not be detected by auscultation alone. Renal ultrasound examination to evaluate for structural kidney anomalies; if indicated, vesicoureterogram (VCUG) to evaluate for vesicoureteral reflux Gastrointestinal evaluation with appropriate radiologic studies for structural anomalies of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, in particular anal stenosis or diaphragmatic abnormalities, gastroesophageal reflux Feeding and swallowing assessment Orthopedic evaluation with appropriate radiologic studies for hip dysplasia as well as joint contractures, club foot, curvature of the spine, and radioulnar synostosis Otolaryngology (ENT) evaluation for stenosis or atresia of ear canals Audiology evaluation with auditory brain stem response testing and otoacoustic emission testing (See Hereditary Hearing Loss and Deafness for more information about this testing.) Ophthalmologic evaluation including dilated fundoscopic examination to assess visual acuity and to evaluate for strabismus Urologic evaluation in males with cryptorchidism and/or micropenis Evaluation by a developmental pediatrician and therapists to develop educational/therapeutic intervention with emphasis on communication skills Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor for evaluation for genetic counseling and to identify at-risk relatives (The +der(22) is almost always inherited from a carrier parent.)

Treatment of Manifestations

Depending on the age and extent of systemic involvement of the individual with Emanuel syndrome, evaluations involving healthcare providers from multiple specialties are necessary. In some individuals, palliative care is appropriate when there are severe structural defects and/or renal failure. Standard management of gastroesophageal reflux; supplementary formulas and consideration of enteral feeds if there is failure to thrive Surgical correction for anal atresia (or stenosis if indicated) and inguinal hernias Standard interventions for: Cardiac defects Cleft palate Hip dysplasia and other skeletal complications. Assistive devices such as walkers are often required for ambulation. Hearing loss Cryptorchidism and/or micropenis Refractive errors, strabismus, or other ophthalmologic issues Seizures, if present Ongoing physical, occupational, and speech therapies to optimize developmental outcome Alternative communication methods to facilitate communication as verbal skills are often very limited

Prevention of Secondary Complications

Care during sedation and/or operative procedures should be provided by a pediatric anesthesiologist as small airways, various palatal abnormalities, and laryngomalacia can be seen in children with Emanuel syndrome.

Surveillance

The following are appropriate: Follow up as needed based on the extent of systemic involvement in the affected individual Regular assessment of developmental progress to guide therapeutic interventions and educational modalities Periodic reevaluation by a clinical geneticist to apprise the family of new developments and/or recommendations

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Therapies Under Investigation

Search ClinicalTrials.gov for access to information on clinical studies for a wide range of diseases and conditions. Note: There may not be clinical trials for this disorder.

Patients and their families should be informed regarding natural history, treatment, mode of inheritance, genetic risks to other family members, and consumer-oriented resources.
