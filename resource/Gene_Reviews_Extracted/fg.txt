Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with FG syndrome type 1 (FGS1), Lujan syndrome (LS), or X-linked Ohdo syndrome (XLOS) the following are recommended: Measurement of height, weight, and head circumference Developmental and behavioral assessment Neurologic history and examination for evidence of seizures and hypotonia Evaluation for evidence of spasticity in individuals with FGS1 Consideration of brain imaging studies in individuals with FGS1 and LS Ophthalmologic evaluation for strabismus, visual deficits, and other ophthalmologic features Examination for evidence of anal anomalies in individuals with FGS1 Examination for evidence of genitourinary anomalies Cardiology evaluation with echocardiogram Audiology evaluation in individuals with XLOS Dental evaluation to evaluate for dental anomalies in individuals with XLOS and LS Consultation with a clinical geneticist

Treatment of Manifestations

 The following measures are appropriate: Early individualized education planning and therapies, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy Individualized management of behavior problems Neurologic management of seizures Ophthalmologic management of strabismus and other ocular anomalies, if present Standard management of chronic constipation for individuals with FGS1 Surgical intervention for imperforate anus, congenital heart defects, and other major malformations, if needed

Prevention of Secondary Complications

 Physical therapy can help prevent and manage joint contractures for individuals with FGS1 or LS.

Surveillance

 The following are appropriate: Growth parameters followed on a regular basis and plotted on age-appropriate curves Regular follow up to monitor developmental progress, behavior concerns, gastrointestinal functioning, and neurologic issues Annual ophthalmologic evaluation for evidence of strabismus and any visual issues Annual audiology evaluation for evidence of hearing loss in XLOS Regular dental evaluations for individuals with XLOS and LS
