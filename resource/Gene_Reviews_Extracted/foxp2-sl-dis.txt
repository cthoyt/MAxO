Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of disease and management needs for an individual with a FOXP2-related speech and language disorder, the following evaluations conducted by a trained and specialized speech-language pathologist are recommended: Detailed developmental history including early oral motor and feeding abilities, speech sound development, motor milestones, and cognitive development Family history of speech disorder Oral-facial structural examination to determine if any structural abnormalities are present Assessment of oral motor function including: Examination of cranial nerve function for evidence of asymmetry, reduced or increased tone, and/or poor coordination of neuromuscular movements Examination for evidence of oral motor dyspraxia (e.g., can the patient perform oral movements on command in isolation [e.g., ‘bite’ or ‘blow’] or in sequence [e.g., ‘kiss and blow’; ‘kiss, blow, and bite’]) Speech sound assessment including a test of single words, sounds in isolation, and connected speech to determine the child’s phonetic inventory (i.e., has the child acquired age-appropriate speech sounds) and to determine if the child has articulation errors, phonologic errors, apraxic errors, dysarthric errors, or a combination of these errors. The presence of resonance or nasality deficits signals the need to consider whether such structurally based velopharyngeal port incompetence is present by referral to an ear, nose, and throat specialist and possibly videopalatography. Language assessment to determine the presence of receptive and/or expressive language impairments across the domains of semantics, syntax, and morphology Literacy assessment or pre-literacy (phonologic awareness) for evidence of reading and spelling difficulties Social skills assessment for the presence of autistic features Additional evaluations: Referral to a neuropsychologist or clinical psychologist to determine the extent of any coexisting cognitive and learning impairments and to examine for the presence of behaviors associated with autism spectrum disorder Referral to a physiotherapist if gross motor movement difficulties are reported and an occupational therapist if fine motor movement difficulties are observed Consideration of MRI to evaluate for the presence of a neurologic lesion if indicated Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Treatment of Manifestations

 Speech and language deficits. A speech pathologist will utilize treatments targeted to the specific findings in an affected individual; hence, the importance of a thorough initial assessment to establish the extent of disease and management needs for an individual. No single recommended treatment exists. The optimal approach should be determined based on the individual’s findings regarding: CAS [American Speech-Language-Hearing Association 2007, Morgan & Vogel 2008, Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists 2011]; Dysarthria [Pennington et al 2009]; Language deficits [Law et al 2003]; Literacy impairments [Snowling & Hulme 2012]. Cognitive deficits. A clinical psychologist or neuropsychologist may provide strategies to help manage deficits in specific cognitive or social skill domains. Fine and gross motor deficits. An occupational therapist and physiotherapist can provide strategies to help with these issues.

Surveillance

 The following are appropriate: Routine care by a general pediatrician Follow-up evaluations with standardized tests by a speech and language pathologist

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

 It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic sibs of an affected individual by molecular genetic testing of the FOXP2 genetic alteration in the family to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt evaluation and initiation of treatment. See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Therapies Under Investigation

 A number of therapies for childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) are under investigation [Morgan & Vogel 2008, Murray et al 2014, Murray et al 2015]. Search ClinicalTrials.gov for access to information on clinical studies for a wide range of diseases and conditions.
