Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the extent of muscle involvement in an individual diagnosed with Udd distal myopathy, the following evaluations are recommended: CT and MRI identify affected muscles with high specificity. EMG can help identify involved muscles but is much less accurate and less convenient for the affected individual. Manual muscle force measurement can be used to help identify involved muscles but is even less specific than EMG.

Treatment of Manifestations

 Usually no specific treatment is needed other than orthoses to counteract foot drop. In individuals in their 40s and 50s with severe drop foot, tibial posterior tendon transposition can be performed to replace lost function of the anterior tibial muscle and long toe extensor muscles.

Surveillance

 Disease progression and the need for rehabilitation and orthotic treatment should be evaluated by neurologic examination every one to four years.

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid

 Heavy muscle force training of weak muscles should be avoided.
