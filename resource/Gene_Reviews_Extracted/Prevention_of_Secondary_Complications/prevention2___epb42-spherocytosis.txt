Regular immunizations are recommended as well as influenza vaccine annually to prevent infections that can precipitate hemolytic or aplastic crisis.

Iron overload and its associated chronic organ failure are risks with any chronic hemolytic anemia especially if frequent transfusions are required.

Treatment with an iron chelator should be implemented, typically after about ten transfusions (which correlate to a serum ferritin concentration of approximately 1000 ng/mL).

The effectiveness of chelation should be monitored by evaluation of liver iron by T2*-weighted MRI or FerriScanÂ® so that the dose of iron chelator can be adjusted appropriately.
