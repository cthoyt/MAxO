The following are appropriate:

Swallow studies and nutritional intervention (i.e., gastrostomy tube placement) for those with severe feeding difficulties

Speech assessments to identify problems amenable to interventions such as assistive communication devices

Early recognition of abnormal tone and spinal problems (i.e., scoliosis) in order to prevent long-term complications
