The major complications of OPMD are aspiration pneumonia, weight loss, and social withdrawal because of frequent choking while eating. To reduce the risk for these complications:

Annual flu vaccination is recommended for elderly affected individuals

Consultation should be sought promptly for a productive cough because of the increased risk for lung abscesses.

Dietary supplements should be added if weight loss is significant.

When eating in social settings, affected individuals should either avoid eating or choose foods that are easy to swallow.

General anesthesia is not contraindicated even though individuals with OPMD may respond differently to certain anesthetics [Caron et al 2005].
