Evidence suggests that preemptive posterior stabilization of the cervical spine in individuals with Larsen syndrome with cervical spine dysplasia may prevent this complication and that combined anterior and posterior stabilization can lead to clinical improvement in individuals with evidence of myelopathy [Sakaura et al 2007].

Because of the cervical vertebral abnormalities observed in both SCT syndrome and Larsen syndrome, the cervical spine should be evaluated for features of instability prior to general anesthesia. Care must be taken intraoperatively to minimize extension of the cervical spine [Malik & Choudhry 2002, Critchley & Chan 2003]. Additionally, individuals with Larsen syndrome are at increased risk for airway complications related to laryngotracheomalacia; thus, it has been suggested that anesthetic agents that exhibit more rapid induction and recovery are preferred [Morishima et al 2004].
