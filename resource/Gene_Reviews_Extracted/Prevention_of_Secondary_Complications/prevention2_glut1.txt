For those who are treated with the ketogenic diet:

L-carnitine supplementation to avoid carnitine deficiency

Proper hydration and avoidance of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors to minimize likelihood of kidney stones.

Avoid carbohydrate-containing foods, intravenous fluids, and medications that will interrupt the state of ketosis. Family care providers often need to serve as the “watch dogs” to intercept these indiscretions.

Valproic acid treatment may be dangerous in individuals on a ketogenic diet because it increases the risk of a Reye-like illness. Additionally, valproic acid may inhibit glucose transport.
