Individuals with RSTS can be difficult to intubate because of the easy collapsibility of the laryngeal wall. An anesthesiologist comfortable with managing complex pediatric airway problems should therefore administer general anesthesia when needed. Because of these problems, individuals with RSTS may require earlier intubation and later extubation than other individuals undergoing similar procedures.
