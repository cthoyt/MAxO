HbH disease

During febrile episodes, a clinical evaluation is recommended because of the increased risk of hemolytic/aplastic crisis (similar to G6PD deficiency, hemolysis in HbH disease can be triggered by infection or oxidative stresses).

When chronic red blood cell transfusions are instituted for individuals with HbH disease, the management should be the same as for all individuals who have been polytransfused, including use of iron chelation therapy (see Beta-Thalassemia).

In individuals with HbH disease who are not red blood cell transfusion dependent, the only iron chelator specifically approved is deferasirox, which has been shown to be superior to placebo in reducing liver iron concentration in those older than age ten years who have beta-thalassemia intermedia, HbE/beta-thalassemia, and HbH disease [Taher et al 2012].

Regular folic acid supplementation should be recommended, as for other hemolytic anemias.

If splenectomy is required, antimicrobial prophylaxis is usually provided, at least until age five years, to decrease the risk of overwhelming sepsis caused by encapsulated organisms. Use of antimicrobial prophylaxis notwithstanding, a careful clinical evaluation of splenectomized individuals with fever is recommended.
