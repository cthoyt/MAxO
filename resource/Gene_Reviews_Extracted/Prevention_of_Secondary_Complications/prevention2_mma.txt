Frequent monitoring of plasma amino acids is necessary to avoid deficiencies of essential amino acids (particularly isoleucine, valine, and methionine) as a result of excessive protein restriction and the development of acrodermatitis-enteropathica-like cutaneous lesions in methylmalonic aciduria, as in other organic acidurias (glutaric aciduria-I) and amino acid disorders (maple syrup urine disease) [De Raeve et al 1994].

Low plasma amino acids can reflect low natural protein intake, imbalanced intake of branched chain amino acid from use of metabolic formulas, or effects of chronic acidosis on branched chain amino acid metabolism [Manoli et al 2016b].
