Because infants with PMM2-CDG (CDG-Ia) have less physiologic reserve than their peers, parents should have a low threshold for evaluation by a physician for prolonged fever, vomiting, or diarrhea. Aggressive intervention with antipyretics, antibiotics if warranted, and hydration may prevent the morbidity associated with the "infantile catastrophic phase."

Although only one individual with skeletal dysplasia in PMM2-CDG (CDG-Ia) has been reported, plain spine films assessing cervical spine anomalies may be useful [Schade van Westrum et al 2006].
