Significant secondary complications of HD include the following:

The complications typically observed with any individual requiring long-term supportive care

The side effects associated with various pharmacologic treatments. Drug side effects are dependent on a variety of factors including the compound involved, the dosage, and the individual; but with the medications typically used in HD, side effects may include depression, sedation, nausea, restlessness, headache, neutropenia, and tardive dyskinesia. For some individuals, the side effects of certain therapeutics may be worse than the symptoms; such individuals would benefit from being removed from the treatment, having the dose reduced, or being 'rested' regularly from the treatment. Current medications used to treat chorea are particularly prone to significant side effects. Individuals with mild to moderate chorea may be better assisted with non-pharmacologic therapies such as movement training and speech therapy.

Depression. Standard treatment is appropriate when indicated [Paulsen et al 2005b, Phillips et al 2008].
