Patients should be protected from infectious exposures as much as is practical. Antibiotics and antiviral agents should be used promptly and aggressively to treat bacterial and viral illnesses. A study by Wolff et al [1972] did not find antibiotic prophylaxis to be beneficial; however, in situations of recurrent bacterial infections, it should be considered.

Antibiotic prophylaxis should be given prior to dental or invasive procedures Widespread use of prophylactic antibiotics prior to invasive dental procedures has been under scrutiny. However, for individuals with compromised immune systems and neutropenia who will be undergoing invasive dental procedures or procedures that cause significant bleeding, prophylaxis should be considered according to American Heart Association guidelines [Tong & Rothwell 2000].

Immunizations are generally well tolerated and should be administered.

Intravenous DDAVP (0.2-0.4 Âµg/kg/dose over 15 to 30 minutes) can be given 30 minutes prior to invasive procedures to help control bleeding. For serious trauma or extensive bleeding, platelet transfusion may be necessary.
