Appropriate preventive measures:

Routine immunizations (including influenza vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine) to prevent respiratory infections

Education about infection control including attention to hand washing, avoidance of sick contacts, proper cleaning/disinfecting respiratory devices, and early use of antibiotics for respiratory illnesses (directed by prior respiratory cultures)
