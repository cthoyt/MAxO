Early initiation of physiotherapy and orthopedic management aims to prevent contractures and maintain ambulation. As needed, individuals should be referred for adaptive aids (e.g., a walker or wheelchair for gait abnormalities) and assistive communication devices.

Symptomatic treatment with antispasticity medications including baclofen and botulinum toxin, and levodopa has been attempted with limited success.

Swallowing evaluation and regular dietary assessments are indicated to assure adequate nutrition. Once an adequate oral diet can no longer be maintained, gastrostomy tube placement should be considered. In order to prevent aspiration pneumonia gastric feeding tube and/or tracheostomy may be required.

The potential for complications from chelation therapy and/or iron supplementation can be lessened by careful surveillance.
