Spasticity: pharmacologic agents, physical therapy

Ataxia: rehabilitation

Seizures: anticonvulsants

Cognitive developmental delay: tailored approach at school or at work

Orthopedic: prevention/treatment of orthopedic problems, such as contractures and scoliosis

Feeding: swallowing surveillance and gastrostomy if needed
