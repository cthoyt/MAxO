By analogy to individuals with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, who also have marked purine overproduction, xanthine oxidase inhibition with allopurinol or febuxostat may result in the formation of xanthine urinary tract stones. These radiolucent stones can be confused clinically with uric acid stones. If residual symptoms of urolithiasis occur in PRS superactivity despite the achievement of goal serum urate concentrations, a stone should be isolated for analysis and/or urinary xanthine concentration should be measured. Management of this pharmacologically induced complication includes reduction in daily allopurinol or febuxostat dosing, with the possible need to accept serum urate concentrations higher than the usual goal range (<6.0 mg/dL; 360 Î¼mol/L).
