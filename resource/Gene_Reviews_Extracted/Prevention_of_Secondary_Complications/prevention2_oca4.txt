Individuals with OCA4 should stay out of the sun from an early age, as cumulative ultraviolet exposure is a major risk factor for skin cancers (see Skin Cancer Risk).

Prolonged periods in the sun require skin protection with clothing (hats with brims, long sleeves and pants, socks) and sunscreen with a high SPF number (total blocks with SPF 45-50+). There is no scientific evidence to indicate how high an SPF value is enough; individuals with OCA4 should use sunscreen with higher SPF values (45-50+) to lessen as much as possible the cumulative effect of ultraviolet to their skin.
