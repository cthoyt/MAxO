Individuals with severe early-onset disease are best vaccinated according to the protocol for other T-cell immunodeficiencies (i.e., only inactivated vaccines should be used with avoidance of all live-attenuated vaccines).

Because of the increased risk of opportunistic infection, prophylaxis (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or atovquone) against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia is usually recommended.

If recurrent oral herpetic infections or shingles occur, prophylactic acyclovir may reduce the morbidity.
