Considering the known adverse effect of fever, it is important to prevent infections and fever as much as possible (e.g., through the use of vaccinations, including anti-flu vaccination); low-dose maintenance antibiotics during winter time, antibiotics for minor infections, and antipyretics for fever are appropriate. For children, wearing a helmet outside helps minimize the effects of possible head trauma.
