Foot ulcers are frequently caused by breakdown of callus. Therefore, it is important to prevent callus formation by removing sources of pressure and to treat existing callus by softening the skin. Routine foot care by a diabetic clinic or by a podiatrist instructed to treat as for a diabetic foot is recommended.

Burns can be prevented by using gloves as needed (e.g., during cooking).

A diabetic education clinic is an excellent source of advice regarding skin care.
