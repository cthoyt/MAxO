Infection of the skin and nails following grooming or trauma is the most common secondary complication seen in PC.

Pre- and post-grooming hygiene and use of clean instruments minimizes this complication.

Antibiotics may be indicated when infection occurs.

A simple ‘bleach bath’ regimen using a mild bleach solution can help prevent infections.
