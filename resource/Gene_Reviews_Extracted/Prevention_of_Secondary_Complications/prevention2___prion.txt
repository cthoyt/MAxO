Similar to the non-genetic forms of prion disease, some genetic forms of prion disease can also be environmentally transmitted to others. Therefore, caution is advised for any affected individual undergoing a surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, brain biopsy): surgical instruments used must be properly decontaminated or discarded to reduce the possibility of transmission of prion disease to other persons.
