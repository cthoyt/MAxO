Short stature. Short stature may result from glucocorticoid-induced growth suppression caused by over-treatment with glucocorticoids or from advanced skeletal maturation caused by inadequate glucocorticoid treatment. Evidence derived from observational studies suggests that the final height of individuals with CAH treated with glucocorticoids is lower than the population norm and lower than expected given parental height [Muthusamy et al 2010]. See Therapies Under Investigation for a discussion of treatment of short stature in individuals with CAH.
