Mask ventilation in the infant and young child is strongly discouraged. Mask ventilation is not adequately stable as a life-sustaining support, with risk for repeated hypoxemia and neurocognitive compromise in the infant and young child. If mask ventilation is used, an actual ventilator is needed as the traditional Bi-PAP machine is not approved for life-sustaining support. Also, close longitudinal follow up by specialists with craniofacial and dental expertise is essential as the potential for doing harm with facial deformation is an important consideration and may necessitate midface advancement in the teen years.
