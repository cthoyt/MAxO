Monitoring of patients under therapy should include routine assessments of treatment efficacy by biochemical testing and clinical evaluation:

Insufficient therapy, underdosage, or malcompliance could lead to reaccumulation of copper and development of new symptoms.

Adverse events related to medical treatment (especially under D-penicillamine treatment) should be evaluated.

Excessive long-term treatment could result in copper deficiency, leading to immobilization of iron (as observed in aceruloplasminemia) and to neurologic symptoms of copper deficiency [Horvath et al 2010, da Silva-JÃºnior et al 2011].
