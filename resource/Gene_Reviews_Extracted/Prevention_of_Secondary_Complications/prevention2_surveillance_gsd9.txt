Liver PhK deficiency. Perioperative care for elective procedures should include IV glucose infusion preoperatively which should start as soon as the patient is made NPO. Continue with intraoperative and postoperative IV glucose infusion to prevent hypoglycemia. IV glucose should be tapered off gradually as the patient tolerates the usual diet. Abrupt discontinuation of fluids could result in hypoglycemia.

If general anesthesia is required, malignant hyperthermia precautions should be taken as individuals with liver PhK deficiency may have increased CK levels and myopathy [Author, personal experience]. (See Malignant Hyperthermia Susceptibility).

During childhood, routine immunizations should be given on the recommended schedule. Any immunizations that may prevent illness, such as influenza leading to hypoglycemia, should be offered.

Muscle PhK deficiency. Lipid-lowering drugs (e.g., statins) that can worsen or unmask myopathy should be used cautiously.
