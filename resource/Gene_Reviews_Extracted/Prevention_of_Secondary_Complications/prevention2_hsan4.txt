Dental care includes the following:

Regular dental examinations and restriction of sweets to prevent dental caries

Early treatment of dental caries and periodontal disease to prevent osteomyelitis of the mandible.

During surgical procedures, the following potential complications need to be considered and avoided:

Inadequate sedation. The congenital absence of peripheral pain fibers may result in analgesia, but inadequate sedation in the postoperative period may trigger unexpected movement, causing secondary injuries. Therefore, tachycardia and hypertension in the postoperative period should raise consideration of the possibility of inadequate sedation.

Hyper- or hypothermia. Temperature needs to be monitored carefully during the perioperative period; heating blankets should not be used.

Of note, the use of muscle relaxants during surgery is not a problem as malignant hyperthermia has not been associated with HSAN [Tomioka et al 2002].
