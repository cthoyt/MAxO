Antibiotic prophylaxis has been used to prevent recurrent infections. In the French study of 22 patients, four received antibiotic prophylaxis [Rigaud et al 2013].

As males with Barth syndrome may be predisposed to hypoglycemia, episodes of fasting (such as prior to surgery) should be as short as possible and accompanied by intravenous glucose infusion [Schlame 2013].

Potassium issues:

Increased risk for hypokalemia. Because males with Barth syndrome can rapidly become potassium-depleted during a gastrointestinal illness (as would anyone with marked muscular hypoplasia) [Kelley 2002], serum potassium levels should be monitored during episodes of diarrhea.

Increased risk for hyperkalemia. Because males with Barth syndrome lack normal muscle “reservoir” for potassium, they can rapidly develop hyperkalemia when given intravenous fluids containing potassium [Kelley 2002]; thus, serum potassium levels should be monitored during the administration of intravenous fluids.

Because of their growth delay, males with Barth syndrome have lower than normal caloric requirements, and attempts to induce growth by overfeeding can lead to chronic diarrhea [Kelley 2002].
