Individuals with CCFDN are prone to develop severe and potentially life-threatening complications related to anesthesia, such as pulmonary edema, inspiratory stridor, malignant hyperthermia, and epileptic seizures [Müllner-Eidenböck et al 2004] and thus need close monitoring and possibly intensive postoperative care.

Affected individuals and care providers need to be aware of rhabdomyolysis as a potential complication following viral infections, and seek medical attention with the first recognizable symptoms. Oral corticosteroid treatment for two to three weeks can result in a full recovery within two to six months [Walter et al 2014]. The long-term outcome depends on the recurrence of rhabdomyolysis episodes [Walter et al 2014].
