Prior to any surgery, the presence of a functioning pheochromocytoma should be excluded by appropriate biochemical screening in any individual with MEN 2A or MEN 2B. In a prospective study of at-risk family members with the pathogenic variant, 8% had pheochromocytoma detected at the same time as MTC [Nguyen et al 2001].

If pheochromocytoma is detected, adrenalectomy should be performed before thyroidectomy to avoid intraoperative catecholamine crisis [Lee & Norton 2000].
