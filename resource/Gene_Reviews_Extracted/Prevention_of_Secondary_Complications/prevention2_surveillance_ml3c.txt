Anesthesia. As with all storage diseases, anesthesia in ML III gamma must be well planned. Because of concerns about airway management, surgical intervention should be undertaken only in tertiary care settings with pediatric anesthesiologists and intensive care physicians.

The anesthetic team should be aware of the following issues:

Persons with ML III gamma are small and have a small airway, reduced tracheal suppleness from stiff connective tissue, and progressive narrowing of the airway from mucosal thickening. The use of a smaller endotracheal tube than for age- and size-matched controls is necessary.

Fiberoptic intubation must be available.

Persons with ML III gamma have short necks and atlanto-axial instability has been reported [Umehara et al 1997].

Jaw and neck movement can be limited

Abnormalities of the spine and ribs can limit the individualâ€™s capacity to breathe and fully expand the lungs.

Antibiotic prophylaxis. Persons with valvular involvement should be given antibiotic prophylaxis before minor and major surgical procedures (including dental procedures) to prevent bacterial endocarditis.
