The only recognized preventable secondary complication may be developmental delay, which may be preventable or ameliorated by early intervention.

Surveillance *

Individuals with an OFC that is increasing faster than normal, signs of increased intracranial pressure, developmental delay, loss of milestones, or seizures should undergo appropriate CNS imaging studies to exclude hydrocephalus, other CNS abnormalities, or cerebral cavernous malformations (seen in some individuals with GCPS and large deletions [Bilguvar et al 2007; Author, unpublished observations]).

*As with the diagnostic criteria (see Diagnosis), no published data support these recommendations, which are those of the author.
