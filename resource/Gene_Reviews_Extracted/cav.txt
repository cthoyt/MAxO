Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with caveolinopathies, initial evaluation includes the following: Orthopedic examination to assess the presence of scoliosis Analysis of respiratory function: spirometry (patients age >5 years), measurement of arterial pO2 and pCO2, measurement of transcutaneous O2 saturation Cardiac examination: 24-hour electrocardiogram and echocardiogram Medical genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations

No specific treatment is currently available for caveolinopathies. Aggressive supportive care is essential to preserve muscle function, to maximize functional ability, and to treat complications, especially in cases with LGMD features. Management should include the following: Weight control to avoid obesity Physical therapy and stretching exercises to promote mobility and prevent contractures Use of mechanical aids such as canes, walkers, orthotics, and wheelchairs as needed to help ambulation and mobility Social and emotional support and stimulation to maximize a sense of social involvement and productivity and to reduce the sense of social isolation common in these disorders [Eggers & Zatz 1998]

Prevention of Secondary Complications

In individuals with isolated hyperCKemia, special precautions during surgical procedures and anesthesia should be considered, despite the fact that malignant hyperthermia (MH) has not been reported in association with CAV3 mutations. (See Malignant Hyperthermia Susceptibility.)

Surveillance

Periodic monitoring of the following is recommended: Spine: orthopedic consultation and, if needed, x-ray analysis Respiratory function: spirometry Cardiac function: 24-hour electrocardiography and echocardiography Mobility and muscle function: physiatrist and physical therapist consultation The interval between visits is determined based on the symptoms and signs observed in the individual patient.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
