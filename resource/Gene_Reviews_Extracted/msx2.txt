Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with enlarged parietal foramina/cranium bifidum, the following evaluations are recommended: Plain skull radiography 3D CT scan of the head with bone windows Brain imaging using CT or MRI scanning, if appropriate Medical genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations

The management of enlarged parietal foramina is generally conservative. Although surgical closure of parietal bone defects has been advocated and performed [Kortesis et al 2003], its role is controversial. The procedure is not likely to be routinely clinically indicated, given the benign natural history of the skull defects, their tendency to reduce in size with age, and uncertainty as to whether symptoms such as headaches are improved. However, persistent cranium bifidum may warrant operative closure [Perlyn et al 2005]. Associated headaches or seizures should be treated symptomatically.

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid

The risk of penetrating injury to the brain is small but may cause anxiety. Education of parents, teachers, and the affected child to avoid risky behaviors suffices in most circumstances. Contact sports should be avoided if a midline bony defect persists.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

When large skull defects are identified prenatally, consideration should be given to delivery planning (e.g., indications to use scalp electrodes, forceps, or vacuum extraction could be reviewed). Elective Caesarian section may theoretically reduce the risk of traumatic birth injury.
