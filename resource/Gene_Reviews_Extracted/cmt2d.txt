Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis

 To establish the diagnosis and extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with GARS-associated axonal neuropathy, nerve conduction studies and EMG of arms and legs are recommended.

Treatment of Manifestations

 Appropriate treatment includes: Prosthetic and adaptive devices for weak hands. Numerous devices are available for various activities of daily living. Ankle support, toe-up braces, and ankle-foot orthotics, as necessary to improve gait.

Prevention of Secondary Complications 

 Stretching exercises, finger splints, and ankle braces to prevent contractures and deformities are appropriate.

Surveillance

 Surveillance includes periodic assessment by a neurologist and/or a neuromuscular disorders specialist to assess progression of weakness in the limbs and determine the need for use of prosthetic and assistive devices.

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid 

 Avoid neurotoxic agents (chemotherapy that may cause peripheral nerve injury).

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk 

 See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
