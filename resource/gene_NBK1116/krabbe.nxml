        <title>Summary</title>
        <sec>
          <title>Clinical characteristics</title>
          <p>Krabbe disease is characterized by infantile-onset progressive neurologic deterioration and death before age two years (85%-90% of individuals) or by onset between age one year and the fifth decade with slower disease progression (10%-15%). Children with the infantile form appear to be normal for the first few months of life but show extreme irritability, spasticity, and developmental delay before age six months; psychomotor regression progresses to a decerebrate state with no voluntary movement. The onset and progression in the late-onset forms can be quite variable. Individuals can be clinically normal until weakness, vision loss, and intellectual regression become evident. The onset of symptoms and clinical course can be variable even among siblings.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Diagnosis/testing</title>
          <p>In almost all individuals with Krabbe disease, galactocerebrosidase (GALC) enzyme activity is deficient (0%-5% of normal activity) in leukocytes isolated from whole heparinized blood or in cultured skin fibroblasts. Testing is most reliable when conducted in a laboratory with demonstrated experience in this assay. Carrier testing by measurement of GALC enzyme activity in leukocytes or in cultured skin fibroblasts is not reliable because of the wide range of enzymatic activities observed in carriers and non-carriers. <italic toggle="yes">GALC</italic> is the gene most commonly known to be associated with Krabbe disease.</p>

          <p><italic toggle="yes">Treatment of manifestations</italic>: Only supportive care to control irritability and spasticity in children with infantile-onset Krabbe disease is available in the later stages (II and III).</p>
          <p><italic toggle="yes">Prevention of primary manifestations</italic>: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in presymptomatic infants and older individuals with mild symptoms may improve and preserve cognitive function, but peripheral nervous system function may deteriorate. Significant clinical variability in late-onset forms makes evaluation of treatment effectiveness difficult.</p>

          <title>Genetic counseling</title>
          <p>Krabbe disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are carriers, each child has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Each healthy sib of a proband has a 2/3 chance of being a carrier. For genetic counseling purposes, a carrier frequency of one in 150 may be used for the general population. Carrier detection by molecular genetic testing is possible if the pathogenic variants have been identified in the family. Prenatal diagnosis is possible either by measurement of GALC enzyme activity or by molecular genetic testing if both pathogenic alleles in an affected family member are known.</p>

          <p>Individuals with the infantile form of Krabbe disease can present with any or all of the following features:</p>

            </list-item>
          </list>
          <p>While most individuals have the infantile form, older individuals ranging in age from six months to the seventh decade have also been diagnosed with galactocerebrosidase deficiency. They usually present with weakness and vision loss and may experience intellectual regression.</p>
          <p><bold>Neuroimaging.</bold> Progressive, diffuse, and symmetric cerebral atrophy is observed by neuroimaging.</p>
          <p>In the early stage of the disease, CT can be normal; diffuse cerebral atrophy involving both gray and white matter develops later. Diffuse hypodensity of the white matter may be present, particularly in the parieto-occipital region. These findings are nonspecific and are observed in many diseases of white matter.</p>
          <p>In general, MRI detects demyelination in the brain stem and cerebellum more clearly than CT at the early stage of the disease; however, some infants have had deceptively normal MRIs when CT had already revealed symmetric hyperdensity involving the cerebellum, thalami, caudate, corona radiata, and brain stem.</p>
          <p>Individuals with Krabbe disease who have severe demyelination show high-intensity lesions on T<sub>2</sub>-weighted images with a loss of diffusional anisotropy and relatively high signal on diffusion-weighted images. Calculation of the T<sub>2</sub> value in the central white matter provides objective judgment for demyelinating diseases. It is progressively prolonged in the occipital deep white matter and posterior part of the central semiovale in individuals with late-onset Krabbe disease.</p>

            <list-item>
              <p><bold>Symptomatic individuals.</bold> Measurement of GALC enzyme activity is best done using the radiolabeled natural substrate galactosylceramide (gal-cer). The in vitro assay using radiolabeled gal-cer utilizes a synthetic buffer and detergent mixture. Some laboratories use the synthetic substrate 6-hexadecanoylamino-4- metylumbelliferyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (HMGal). All individuals with Krabbe disease have very low GALC enzyme activity (0%-5% of normal activity) in leukocytes isolated from whole heparinized blood and cultured skin fibroblasts. This test is most reliable when conducted in a laboratory with demonstrated experience in performing the assay.Note: The finding of GALC enzyme activity that is 8%-20% of normal in a healthy individual, in an individual with neurologic disease that is not typical of any form of Krabbe disease, or in an individual identified by newborn screening presents a diagnostic problem and requires additional study. In most instances, such individuals have multiple copies of known polymorphisms in both <italic toggle="yes">GALC</italic> alleles. However, some individuals with enzyme activity in this range may have a pathogenic variant on one allele and multiple polymorphic changes on the other allele, and thus may be carriers of Krabbe disease.</p>

            <list-item>
              <p><bold>Carrier testing.</bold> Carrier testing by measurement of GALC enzyme activity in leukocytes or cultured skin fibroblasts is not reliable because of the wide range of enzymatic activities observed in carriers and non-carriers. The presence of normal variants (polymorphisms) in the <italic toggle="yes">GALC</italic> coding region results in amino acid changes that lower GALC enzyme activity but do not result in clinical disease when inherited in the homozygous state or, as far as is known, when inherited together with a pathogenic variant.Note: Although the finding of low GALC enzyme activity in one or both healthy parents of an affected child (due to the presence of polymorphisms in their normal allele) makes prenatal testing using enzyme measurement more difficult, it is accurate when performed in an experienced laboratory.</p>

              <p><bold>Newborn screening.</bold> With improvements in treatment options for presymptomatic individuals, efforts to develop newborn screening methods are underway. A method using dried blood spots and tandem mass spectrometry to measure GALC enzyme activity has been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="krabbe.REF.li.2004a.638">Li et al 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="krabbe.REF.li.2004b.1785">Li et al 2004b</xref>]. In August 2006 New York State instituted newborn screening for Krabbe disease; to date over 1,000,000 newborns have been screened.Four newborns were identified as being at risk of developing infantile Krabbe disease. The identification of these newborns permitted umbilical cord blood transplantation in three within the first month of life; the parents of the fourth infant did not elect this option. One newborn who underwent transplantation subsequently died of complications of the transplant; the other two are still alive. Other high-risk individuals were identified by confirming enzymatic studies [Wenger, unpublished].] and by molecular genetic testing. Their pathogenic variants suggest a later-onset disease or possibly no disease; their clinical status is being carefully monitored. At this time several other states are considering newborn screening for Krabbe disease; to date none have implemented the program.</p>

          <title>Clinical Description</title>
          <p>Approximately 85%-90% of individuals with Krabbe disease have the infantile form presenting with extreme irritability, spasticity, and developmental delay before age six months. The remaining 10%-15% have onset between age six months and the seventh decade.</p>
          <p><bold>Infantile form.</bold> The infantile form typically has three stages:</p>
          <list list-type="bullet">
            <list-item>
              <p><bold>Stage I</bold> is characterized by irritability, stiffness, arrest of motor and mental development, and episodes of temperature elevation without infection, possibly caused by involvement of the hypothalamus. The child, apparently normal for the first few months after birth, becomes hypersensitive to auditory, tactile, or visual stimuli and begins to cry frequently without apparent cause. Many infants keep their fists tightly clenched throughout their lives. Slight retardation or regression of psychomotor development as well as vomiting and other feeding difficulties may result in progressive loss of weight leading to emaciation. In some infants, peripheral neuropathy is a presenting feature with no other neurologic symptoms appreciated for several months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="krabbe.REF.kornlubetzki.2003.115">Korn-Lubetzki et al 2003</xref>]. Seizures may occur as an initial clinical symptom. Infantile spasms rarely occur. The CSF protein concentration is already increased at this stage.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p><bold>Stage II</bold> is characterized by rapid and severe motor and mental deterioration. There is marked hypertonicity with extended and crossed legs, flexed arms, and a backward-bent head. Tendon reflexes are hyperactive. Minor tonic or clonic seizures occur. Optic atrophy and sluggish pupillary reactions to light are common. Clinical examination does not always reveal peripheral neuropathy, especially in the early stages when symptoms and signs of central nervous system involvement are overwhelming.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p><bold>Stage III,</bold> sometimes reached within a few weeks or months, is the "burnt out" stage. The infant is blind and decerebrate with no voluntary movement. The infant has no contact with his/her surroundings.</p>
            </list-item>
          </list>
          <p>The average age of death in children with the infantile form is 13 months; however, some succumb by age eight months from infections and respiratory failure, while others live for more than two years. Even with the best care, it is difficult to extend the life of a severely affected child.</p>
          <p>Symptoms and signs are confined to the nervous system. No visceromegaly is present. Head size may be large or small; hydrocephalus has been observed. Macular cherry-red spots were described in one individual.</p>
          <p>One infant, diagnosed with Krabbe disease in utero, had normal psychomotor development for the first two months of life but lost deep tendon reflexes by age five weeks, had markedly reduced nerve conduction velocities at age seven weeks, and developed neck muscle weakness at age three months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="krabbe.REF.lieberman.1980.446">Lieberman et al 1980</xref>]. These findings suggest that careful examination could reveal clinical manifestations of Krabbe disease in an affected infant earlier than the reported age of onset.</p>
          <p><bold>Late-onset forms.</bold> Individuals with late-onset forms can be clinically normal until almost any age when symptoms of weakness, vision loss, and intellectual regression become evident. The clinical course of older individuals is variable. Individuals with the late-infantile or juvenile form who present after age one year may have nonspecific findings related to walking difficulties, vision loss, and loss of developmental milestones. These individuals regress at an unpredictable rate.</p>
          <p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="krabbe.REF.loonen.1985.137">Loonen et al [1985]</xref> identified late-infantile (early-childhood) and juvenile (late-childhood) forms in 18 individuals.</p>
          <p>In the late-infantile group (onset age 6 months - 3 years), irritability, psychomotor regression, stiffness, ataxia, and loss of vision were the most common initial symptoms. In most cases the course was progressive and resulted in death approximately two years after onset.</p>
          <p>In the juvenile group (onset age 3-8 years), children developed loss of vision together with hemiparesis, ataxia, and psychomotor regression. Most children with the juvenile form showed an initial rapid deterioration followed by a more gradual progression lasting for years. None died during the follow-up period that ranged from ten months to seven years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="krabbe.REF.loonen.1985.137">Loonen et al 1985</xref>].</p>
          <p>Some individuals with onset in adolescence and adulthood present with loss of manual dexterity, burning paresthesia in their extremities, and weakness without intellectual deterioration; others become bedridden and continue to deteriorate mentally and physically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="krabbe.REF.kolodny.1991.232">Kolodny et al 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="krabbe.REF.satoh.1997.1392">Satoh et al 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="krabbe.REF.jardim.1999.1014">Jardim et al 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="krabbe.REF.wenger.2003">Wenger 2003</xref>].</p>
          <p>The adult-onset group includes individuals in whom the diagnosis was first made in adulthood (because the subtle symptoms present earlier in life did not prompt biochemical testing) as well as individuals considered completely normal until symptoms began after age 20 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="krabbe.REF.kolodny.1991.232">Kolodny et al 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="krabbe.REF.satoh.1997.1392">Satoh et al 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="krabbe.REF.wenger.2003">Wenger 2003</xref>]. An example of the former is an individual reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="krabbe.REF.kolodny.1991.232">Kolodny et al [1991]</xref> (case 15) who had been "shaky" in childhood, walked slowly with a stiff and wide-based gait, and had progressive, generalized neurologic deterioration after age 40 years. She died of pneumonia at age 73 years. An example of the latter is a woman who developed slowly progressive spastic paraparesis at age 38 years. Demyelination identified on MRI was confined to the corticospinal tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="krabbe.REF.satoh.1997.1392">Satoh et al 1997</xref>].</p>
          <p>The phenotypes can differ considerably among individuals with later-onset forms, including siblings, who have the same <italic toggle="yes">GALC</italic> genotype. Findings in two sisters illustrate this point. At age 28 years, sister 1 had been considered normal until a few years previously when she experienced lower-extremity paresis with episodes of tripping and clumsiness when walking. Heel cord lengthening was performed, but spastic paresis continued with clumsy gait and difficulty rising from a squatting or sitting position. Ten years earlier, nerve conduction studies had shown slowing in motor and sensory fibers. She had no obvious intellectual impairment, was married and had a child, and at age 38 years continues to work. Sister 2 had been considered normal until age four to five years, when she developed progressive weakness in all extremities. She experienced rapid mental deterioration and seizures. At age 36 years, she was significantly intellectually disabled and wheelchair bound, although she could function in a sheltered environment [personal observation].</p>
          <p><bold>Electroencephalogram (EEG).</bold> While normal in the initial stages, the EEG gradually becomes abnormal. Background activity becomes slow and disorganized, with changes that may be asymmetric.</p>
          <p><bold>EMG and NCV.</bold> Motor nerve conduction velocities (NCVs) are consistently low. NCV studies have been reported to be normal in some adults with an enzymatically confirmed diagnosis.</p>
          <p>Visual and auditory evoked responses, NCV, and EEG are all more frequently and more severely abnormal in individuals with early-infantile onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="krabbe.REF.husain.2004.617">Husain et al 2004</xref>].</p>
          <p><bold>MRI.</bold> In general, in the early stage of Krabbe disease MRI detects demyelination in the brain stem and cerebellum more clearly than CT, but some infants have a deceptively normal MRI.</p>
          <p>In some cases, CT reveals symmetric hyperdensity involving the cerebellum, thalami, caudate, corona radiata, and brain stem.</p>
          <p>On MRI the T<sub>1</sub> value is decreased, with normal or slightly decreased T<sub>2</sub> in white matter of the centrum semiovale.</p>
          <p>T<sub>2</sub>-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI showed symmetric high intensity of the pyramidal tract and optic radiation in an adult whose initial clinical manifestations occurred at age 60 years. The T<sub>2</sub> value is progressively prolonged in the occipital deep white matter and posterior part of central semiovale in late-onset disease. MRI is also useful for differentiation between dysmyelination and demyelination. Individuals with Krabbe disease with severe demyelination showed high-intensity lesions on T<sub>2</sub>-weighted images, with a loss of diffusional anisotropy and relatively high signal intensity on diffusion-weighted images [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="krabbe.REF.husain.2004.617">Husain et al 2004</xref>].</p>
          <p><bold>MRS.</bold> Magnetic resonance spectroscopy can also be used to document the demyelination, gliosis, and axonal loss in white matter of individuals with typical and atypical Krabbe disease.</p>

            <p>Occasionally, some individuals with Krabbe disease have slightly higher than expected GALC enzyme activity. Because the active enzyme consists of a large aggregate containing multiple copies of the 30-kd and 50-kd subunits derived from the same precursor and because many individuals are compound heterozygotes, it is difficult to place much significance on the detection of a small amount of residual enzyme activity.</p>

<bold>(metachromatic leukodystrophy, MLD)</bold> is characterized by three clinical subtypes that can closely resemble late-onset Krabbe disease: late-infantile MLD (50%-60% of cases) with onset between age one and two years; juvenile MLD (~20%-30%) with onset between age four years and sexual maturity (12-14 years); and adult MLD (~15%-20%) with onset after sexual maturity. All individuals eventually lose motor and intellectual functions. The disease course may be from three to ten or more years in the late infantile-onset form and up to 20 years or more in the juvenile- and adult-onset forms. Death most commonly results from pneumonia or other infection.</p>
          <p>MLD is suggested by arylsulfatase A enzyme activity in leukocytes that is less than 10% of normal controls. Because of the high frequency of the so-called pseudodeficiency (Pd) allele, additional studies in all individuals with low arylsulfatase activity are required. The diagnosis of MLD is confirmed by one or more of the following additional tests: molecular genetic testing of <italic toggle="yes">ARSA</italic>, urinary excretion of sulfatides, and/or finding of metachromatic lipid deposits in nervous system tissue.

They are clinically variable, ranging from newborns with nonimmune fetal hydrops to adults with varying degrees of neurologic involvement. In addition to psychomotor retardation, young individuals usually have coarse facial features and hepatosplenomegaly, neither of which is found in individuals with Krabbe disease. Skeletal involvement is variable. Some individuals primarily have dysostosis multiplex with no neurologic involvement, and others have only neurologic problems, such as dysarthria, and mild vertebral changes. Low-acid &#x003b2;-galactosidase enzyme activity in both leukocytes and plasma establishes the diagnosis of GM1 gangliosidosis and Morquio syndrome type B and differentiates them from galactosialidosis, a disorder in which &#x003b2;-galactosidase enzyme activity is low in leukocytes only.</p>
          <p><bold>GM2 gangliosidosis.</bold> The GM2 gangliosidoses are a group of neurodegenerative disorders caused by the intralysosomal storage of the specific glycosphingolipid GM2 ganglioside. Tay-Sachs disease, the prototype GM2 gangliosidosis, is characterized by loss of motor skills beginning between age three and six months with progressive evidence of neurodegeneration, including seizures, macular cherry-red spots, and blindness. Total incapacitation and death usually occur before age four years. The juvenile, chronic, and adult-onset variants of <related-object link-type="booklink" source-id="gene" document-id="tay-sachs" document-type="chapter">hexosaminidase A deficiency</related-object> have later onset, slower progression, and more variable neurologic findings, including progressive dystonia, spinocerebellar degeneration, motor neuron disease, and in some individuals with adult-onset disease, a bipolar form of psychosis.</p>
          <p>The diagnosis of hexosaminidase A deficiency relies on the demonstration of absent to near-absent beta-hexosaminidase A (HEX A) enzymatic activity in the serum or white blood cells of a symptomatic individual in the presence of normal or elevated activity of the beta-hexosaminidase B (HEX B) isoenzyme. Variant analysis of <italic toggle="yes">HEXA</italic> is used primarily for genetic counseling purposes (1) to distinguish pseudodeficiency alleles from pathogenic alleles in individuals with apparent deficiency of HEX A enzymatic activity identified in population screening programs and (2) to identify specific pathogenic alleles in affected individuals.</p>

Most individuals with Canavan disease have macrocephaly, which is a variable finding in individuals with Krabbe disease. MRI shows prominent involvement of subcortical white matter.

        <p><bold>Gene structure.</bold> The normal gene is approximately 57 kb in length with 17 exons that code for 669 amino acids. The reference protein NP_000144.2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="krabbe.T.common_galc_polymorphisms_and_p">Table 2</xref>) has 685 amino acids because by convention longer isoforms are chosen as reference sequences. Compared to the 669-amino acid isoform described by Wenger et al, this one uses an alternate start codon that is 48 nucleotides upstream.</p>
        <p>The 5' flanking region of the gene is GC rich and contains one potential YY1 element and one potential SP1 binding site. The strongest promoter activity is -176 to -24 upstream of the initiation codon. Inhibitory sequences are immediately upstream of the promoter region and within intron 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="krabbe.REF.luzi.1997.159">Luzi et al 1997</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="krabbe.T.common_galc_polymorphisms_and_p">Table 2</xref>).</p>
        <p><bold>Pathogenic allelic variants.</bold> More than 110 pathogenic variants have been identified (some are summarized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="krabbe.REF.wenger.2001">Wenger et al [2001]</xref>, others unpublished). The more common pathogenic variants that have occurred in more than one unrelated individual in either the homozygous or heterozygous state are in <xref ref-type="table" rid="krabbe.T.common_galc_polymorphisms_and_p">Table 2</xref>.</p>
        <p>Pathogenic variants occur in every one of the 17 exons. Missense variants causing the infantile form of Krabbe disease are found in both subunits, although more seem to be found in the coding region for the 30-kd subunit.</p>
        <p>The 30-kb deletion, which always occurs in <italic toggle="yes">cis</italic> with the c.550C&#x0003e;T polymorphism (benign variant), accounts for approximately 45% of pathogenic alleles in the population of European ancestry. The 30-kb deletion, starting within the large intron 10 and continuing beyond the end of the gene, probably originated in Sweden and spread throughout Europe, including Spain. This deletion comprises a significant number of pathogenic alleles in individuals of Mexican, Pakistani, and Indian heritage. This deletion results in the classic infantile form when found in the homozygous state or in the compound heterozygous state with another severe pathogenic variant. Several other variants associated with the infantile phenotype make up another 15% of the pathogenic alleles in individuals with European ancestry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="krabbe.REF.kleijer.1997.587">Kleijer et al 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="krabbe.REF.wenger.1997.268">Wenger et al 1997</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="krabbe.T.common_galc_polymorphisms_and_p">Table 2</xref>).</p>
        <p>The variant c.857G&#x0003e;A always results in the later-onset form of Krabbe disease. One copy of this variant, even when present with the 30-kb deletion as the second allele, results in late-onset Krabbe disease. In all c.857G&#x0003e;A alleles that have been examined it was found in <italic toggle="yes">cis</italic> configuration with the c.1685T&#x0003e;C polymorphism. Whether pathogenesis requires the presence of both or only one nucleotide change is not known.</p>
        <p>A number of small deletions and insertions result in frame shift and premature termination. Even missense variants very near the 3' end of the coding region that result in amino acid changes near the carboxyl end of the 30-kd subunit result in clinical disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="krabbe.REF.rafi.1996.304">Rafi et al 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="krabbe.REF.jardim.1999.1014">Jardim et al 1999</xref>]. It is difficult to predict the clinical presentation from the location or type of missense variant.</p>

        <p><bold>Normal gene product.</bold> The 80-kd precursor protein contains six potential glycosylation sites and is proteolytically cut into the active 50-kd and 30-kd subunits. These subunits are not active individually, and galactocerebrosidase (GALC) enzyme activity cannot be generated by mixing together the two subunits. The subunits aggregate into a very high molecular-weight complex that is very hydrophobic. Normally only a very small amount of GALC protein is made in all cell types; however, it appears to be stable and to work efficiently on the natural substrates.</p>
        <p><bold>Abnormal gene product.</bold> It appears that most pathogenic missense variants result in the production of protein that is unstable and rapidly degraded. All small and large deletions result either in a frame shift resulting in a premature stop codon, insertion or deletion of amino acids, or deletion of a significant portion of the gene. The polymorphisms listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="krabbe.T.common_galc_polymorphisms_and_p">Table 2</xref> result in protein that is less active than protein coded for by the most common allele. This reduced activity may result from changes in secondary structure of the mature enzyme or from protein instability. While these effects are measurable in vitro, it is not known what effects the changes have in vivo, especially in the peripheral and central nervous systems.</p>
