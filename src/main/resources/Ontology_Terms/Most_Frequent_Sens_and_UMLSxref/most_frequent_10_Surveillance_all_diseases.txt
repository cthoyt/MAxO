surveillance should be individualized using a multidisciplinary approach	
individuals on ert also require periodic monitoring as follows:	
plasma levels of peg-ada activity	
erythrocyte daxp concentration

serial evaluation of eegs to monitor disease progression is appropriate	
in particular:	
dental findings over time may warrant use of dental prosthetics	
monitoring for signs of diabetes insipidus in the neonatal period	
monitoring of the spine for the development of scoliosis	
this should not be delayed unnecessarily	
if puberty does start spontaneously it is likely to arrest	
thus, careful monitoring of testosterone levels is needed	
routine dermatologic evaluation to monitor for vascular and other malignancies	
a few other countries have also initiated screening	
note: serum α-fetoprotein measurement is not helpful	
asymptomatic children at risk	
less frequent intervals may also be appropriate	
every 1-2 months in infants age ≤12 months	
every 3-4 months in children age ≤10 years
