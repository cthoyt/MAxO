Individuals known to have a hereditary PGL/PCC syndrome, individuals without clinical manifestations of a hereditary PGL/PCC syndrome but known to have a SDHA, SDHB,

SDHC, SDHD,

SDHAF2, or MAX pathogenic variant, and relatives at risk based on family history who have not undergone DNA-based testing need regular clinical monitoring by a physician or medical team with expertise in treatment of hereditary PGL/PCC syndromes.

Screening should begin at age ten years or at least ten years before the earliest age at diagnosis in the family. Benn et al [2006] estimated that if lifelong screening were to begin at age ten years, disease would be detected in all persons with SDHD pathogenic variants and 96% of persons with SDHB pathogenic variants.

Although no clear consensus has been developed regarding when, how, and how often biochemical studies and imaging should be done in at-risk individuals, it is reasonable to consider lifelong annual biochemical and clinical surveillance. The findings of these evaluations should guide imaging studies [Mannelli 2006, Pacak et al 2007, Lenders et al 2014]. Monitoring includes the following:

Twenty-four hour urinary excretion of fractionated metanephrines and catecholamines, and/or plasma fractionated metanephrines to detect metastatic disease, tumor recurrence, or the development of additional tumors

Follow-up imaging by MRI, CT, 123I-MIBG, or FDG-PET if the fractionated metanephrine and/or catecholamine levels become elevated, or if the original tumor had minimal or no catecholamine/fractionated metanephrine excess. In some individuals the image modality that was most effective in identifying the original tumor may prove to be equally effective in surveillance. Given the concern for cumulative radiation exposure in individuals who harbor germline pathogenic variants in genes associated with PGL/PCC, MRI may be the preferable imaging modality, with CT and nuclear imaging modalities reserved to further characterize tumors that are detected.

In persons with SDHD and SDHC pathogenic variants, periodic (e.g., every 2 years) MRI or CT of the skull base and neck to detect paragangliomas and periodic (e.g., every 4 years) body MRI or CT and 123I-MIBG scintigraphy to detect paragangliomas or metastatic disease that may occur beyond the neck and skull base

In persons with SDHB pathogenic variants, periodic (e.g., every 2 years) MRI or CT of the abdomen, thorax, and pelvis to detect paragangliomas and periodic (e.g., every 4 years) 123I-MIBG scintigraphy to detect paragangliomas or metastatic disease that may not be detected with MRI or CT

In individuals (especially children, adolescents, or young adults) who have unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., abdominal pain, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, nausea, vomiting, difficulty swallowing) or who experience unexplained intestinal obstruction or anemia, consideration of evaluation for GISTs [Pasini et al 2008]
