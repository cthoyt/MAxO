According to the European Hyperoxaluria Consortium (OxalEurope) [Cochat et al 2012] individuals with:

Preserved renal function (i.e., measured or estimated GFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m2) likely require only the following to evaluate/ensure treatment efficacy:

Regular renal ultrasound examinations and fundoscopic eye examinations to identify the extent of any oxalate deposition

Ongoing urinalysis (spot and 24-hour collections)

GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 should have the above evaluations as well as regular (not defined) measurements of plasma oxalate.

GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or a rapid deterioration in function should have the above evaluations as well as the following testing (performed prior to initiation of dialysis if possible, and repeated as needed):

Bone x-rays to evaluate for radiodense metaphyseal bands and diffuse demineralization, potentially bone marrow examination may also be required

Thyroid function testing

Electrocardiogram to evaluate for an associated atrioventricular block

Ultrasound and/or CT scan of the heart and viscera for evaluation of calcification in such organs

Hemoglobin to evaluate for anemia associated with either renal dysfunction or marrow deposition of oxalate

History and physical examination to assess the risk of arterial insufficiency or ischemia based on vessel wall deposition

Further testing and surveillance of other organ involvement can be inferred from the list in Table 4 â€“ noting that at GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 the ongoing deposition of tissue oxalate (oxalosis) will, of course, predispose all patients to multi-organ involvement, and this will worsen/accelerate as the patient enters ESRD/ initiates dialysis.

Note: Investigations should likely occur more often in newly diagnosed symptomatic individuals or in children younger than age two to three years.
