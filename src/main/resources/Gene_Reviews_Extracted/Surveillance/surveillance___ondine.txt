For all individuals with CCHS, the following evaluations are recommended:

At least yearly (every 6 months until age 3 years) comprehensive, multiple-day in-hospital physiologic evaluation (see Table 4)

Yearly echocardiogram to identify right ventricular hypertrophy and/or cor pulmonale

Yearly hemoglobin, hematocrit, and reticulocyte counts to identify polycythemia

Table 4 summarizes the recommended clinical evaluations for affected individuals with CCHS based on the PHOX2B variant present.

PARM = polyalanine repeat expansion mutation with number of repeats on each allele, e.g., 20/24

NPARM = non-polyalanine repeat expansion mutation (i.e., missense, nonsense, frameshift, stop codon)

Note: In infants and those newly diagnosed with LO-CCHS the recommendation is for above-described evaluation every 6 months until age 3 years (or 3 years from the LO-CCHS diagnosis).

1. 

Awake and asleep physiologic testing in varying levels of concentration and activity simulating activities of daily living; exogenous and endogenous gas challenges; comprehensive age-appropriate clinical autonomic testing

2. 

Annual chest and abdominal imaging to identify ganglioneuromas and ganglioneuroblastomas and potentially neuroblastomas

3. 

Chest and abdominal imaging and urine cathecholamines every 3 months in the first 2 years, then every 6 months until age 7 years to identify neuroblastomas

4. 

Exon or whole-gene deletion or duplication
