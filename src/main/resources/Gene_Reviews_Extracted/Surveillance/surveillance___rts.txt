The following are appropriate:

Annual evaluation by a physician familiar with RTS

Monitoring of growth

For individuals without cataracts, yearly eye examinations for screening purposes

Prompt skeletal radiographic examination when clinical suspicion of osteosarcoma is present (including bone pain, swelling, or an enlarging lesion on a limb) due to the high risk for this potentially lethal malignancy, particularly for those individuals with pathogenic deleterious variants in RECQL4

Frequent monitoring for any evidence of malignancy in affected family members of individuals with RTS and osteosarcoma (because of reports of more than one sib with RTS also developing osteosarcoma)

Close monitoring of the skin for lesions with unusual color or texture, as individuals with RTS are at increased risk for skin cancers
