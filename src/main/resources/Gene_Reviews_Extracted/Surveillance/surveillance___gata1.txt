Depending on the phenotype of the disease, complete blood counts should be monitored so that supportive care can be provided as needed. Individuals with mild cytopenias require infrequent monitoring (yearly), while those with severe cytopenias who require transfusions should have complete blood counts monthly or as indicated by clinical signs and symptoms.

Individuals undergoing repeated erythrocyte transfusions should be monitored for iron overload and managed appropriately with iron chelation therapy.
