Adrenal function should be reevaluated periodically in males with X-ALD whose initial evaluation revealed normal adrenal cortical function [Dubey et al 2005].

Males with X-ALD should undergo brain MRI every six months through childhood and then yearly to monitor for the development of cerebral disease [Peters et al 2004] because MRI abnormalities occur well in advance of clinical disease [Loes et al 2003] and the evidence clearly shows that HSCT has the best outcome when performed on an asymptomatic individual [Shapiro et al 2000, Peters et al 2004, Mahmood et al 2007].
