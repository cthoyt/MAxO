Attention to ongoing care, including adherence to high fluid intake and medication schedule, is essential to good outcomes.

For patients who are stable and doing well* the following are recommended annually:

Clinical assessment of stone-related symptoms including pain, frequency of passage of stones or gravel in the urine, and urinary tract infection

Assessment of kidney function (serum creatinine and eGFR) and electrolytes

Measurement of plasma oxalate concentration, particularly in those with any impairment of glomerular filtration rate (GFR)

24 hour urine oxalate and supersaturation study. During follow up, changes in the urine supersaturation can be used to monitor the effectiveness of therapy by confirming that the crystallization potential has decreased.

Renal ultrasound examination or other imaging to monitor for stone formation

*Very young patients, those with complex stone problems, and those with reduced kidney function need closer management with more frequent assessments.
