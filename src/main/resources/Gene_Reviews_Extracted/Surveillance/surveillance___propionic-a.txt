The following evaluations are performed at different intervals depending on factors such as age, disease severity, and presence of catabolic stressors; evaluation frequency can range from every three months to annually.

Clinical evaluation should include assessment of the following:

Linear growth, weight gain, head circumference, and body mass index

Interval assessment for the need of G-tube

Neurologic evaluation including survey for seizures and movement disorders

Interval ophthalmologic evaluation including dilated eye examination

Audiology evaluation

Evaluation for clinical signs of cardiomyopathy (e.g., tachycardia, tachypnea, shortness of breathy, hepatomegaly)

Evaluation of integumentary system (skin, hair, G-tube, and central line insertion sites)

Developmental and neurocognitive progress, as age-appropriate

Laboratory evaluation should include the following:

Metabolic studies: urine organic acids, pre-prandial plasma amino acids (especially, isoleucine, leucine, valine, threonine, and methionine), plasma ammonia concentration, plasma free and total carnitine, and quantitative plasma acylcarnitine profile

Nutritional studies: electrolytes, mineral panel, albumin, prealbumin, hemoglobin, vitamin D, iron studies, essential fatty acids, and trace minerals (selenium and zinc)

Complete blood count and differential to monitor for cytopenias

Renal function tests; serum cystatin C can be more sensitive than plasma creatinine in identifying early evidence of chronic renal failure.

Amylase and lipase as needed to evaluate for pancreatitis

Other evaluations:

Cardiology evaluation, screening for cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias by echocardiogram, ECG, and Holter monitor, annual and as needed

Ophthalmologic evaluation to assess optic nerve and retinal changes, annually and as needed

DEXA scan

Brain MRI, MRS, and EEG as clinically indicated

Physical, occupational, and speech therapy services to determine need
