No surveillance guidelines have been developed. However, all individuals with APRT deficiency should see their physician every six to 12 months to:

Monitor kidney function;

Assess the urinary excretion of DHA crystals (disappearance of the crystals is considered an adequate treatment response);

Facilitate medication compliance.

Periodic renal ultrasound examinations may be considered to evaluate for new kidney stones.
