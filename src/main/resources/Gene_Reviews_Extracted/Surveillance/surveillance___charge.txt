Regular ophthalmologic evaluations are appropriate to follow changes in acuity and risks for retinal detachment and/or cataract. Monitoring nonverbal infants and children who are unable to report subjective loss of vision can permit timely detection of retinal detachment and appropriate surgical repair where necessary.

Frequent retesting of hearing by a pediatric audiologist may be necessary to determine the exact type and extent of hearing loss and to assess the success of hearing habilitation.

Frequent clinical and radiologic dental evaluations should be performed.
