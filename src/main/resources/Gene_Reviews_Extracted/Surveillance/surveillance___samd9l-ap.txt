The following are appropriate:

Complete blood count annually. If cytopenias are identified these should be monitored more frequently.

Patient/family education to seek prompt clinical evaluation if any signs or symptoms suggestive of hematopoietic cytopenia develop (e.g., fatigue, pallor, unexpected bleeding, recurrent infections).

Annual evaluation of gait, coordination, and speech.
