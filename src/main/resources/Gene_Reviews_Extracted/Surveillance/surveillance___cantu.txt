If cardiac abnormalities are present, follow-up intervals should be determined by the cardiologist according to the specific clinical manifestations. Otherwise, yearly echocardiogram and electrocardiogram are recommended to monitor cardiac size and function, as well as for evidence of pericardial effusion. These studies should be started in infancy, or as soon as the diagnosis is made, and continued throughout life.

Spine radiographs to assess for scoliosis should be performed if there is concern based on physical examination. If scoliosis is present, continued monitoring by an orthopedist is recommended.

Consider brain MRI with magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) to evaluate persistent headaches or other neurological symptoms, given the increased risk for cerebral vascular abnormalities.

Affected individuals should be monitored for edema â€“which often develops in adolescence or early adulthood- by reviewing the medical history regarding swelling of the limbs, and by physical examination.
