HbH disease

Hematologic evaluation every six to 12 months to determine the steady state levels of hemoglobin

In children, assessment of growth and development every six to 12 months

Monitoring of iron load with annual determination of serum ferritin concentration in individuals who have been transfused, in older individuals, and in those given inappropriate iron supplementation. Since serum ferritin may underestimate the degree of iron overload, a periodic quantitative measurement of liver iron concentration is also recommended [Musallam et al 2012].
