Liver PhK deficiency

Regular evaluation by a metabolic physician familiar with liver PhK deficiency to monitor medical issues and a metabolic nutritionist to give dietary recommendations and monitor cornstarch requirement

Regular monitoring of blood glucose concentration and ketones, as recommended by a metabolic physician and nutritionist. Blood glucose concentrations and ketones should also be measured during times of stress including illness, intense activity, rapid growth, puberty, and pregnancy; and at any time in which intake of food is reduced or meal and/or cornstarch dose or scheduling is altered. Note: It is possible that blood glucose concentrations may be normal when moderate to large ketosis in liver PhK deficiency results from increased fatty acid oxidation and upregulated gluconeogenesis. The role of ketone monitoring in this setting as a marker of metabolic control requires further systematic investigation.

Liver imaging. In children younger than age 18 years, liver ultrasound examination every 12 to 24 months. With increasing age, consideration of CT or MRI using intravenous contrast to evaluate for complications of liver disease

Follow-up echocardiogram. No guidelines established. Follow up approximately every two years or earlier if symptoms are present

Muscle PhK deficiency

Regular evaluation by a metabolic physician familiar with liver PhK deficiency to monitor medical issues and a metabolic nutritionist to give dietary recommendations and monitor cornstarch requirement.

Regular evaluation by a physical therapist to look for progression in symptoms and to guide exercise program
