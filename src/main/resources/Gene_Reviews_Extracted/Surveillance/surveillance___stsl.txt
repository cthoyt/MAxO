Monitor plasma concentrations of plant sterols (primarily beta-sitosterol and campesterol) and cholesterol, and the size, number, and distribution of xanthomas [Kidambi & Patel 2008] at least every six to 12 months.

Monitor platelet count for thrombocytopenia, CBC for evidence of hemolytic anemia, and liver enzymes for elevation beginning at the time of diagnosis with the frequency determined by the severity of the clinical and biochemical findings.

In those with longstanding untreated sitosterolemia, surveillance for atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease is indicated, with the level of monitoring determined by the severity of the clinical and biochemical findings.
