Surveillance for otologic and renal anomalies should be offered as described below.

Otologic anomalies. Serial audiometry to survey for progression of hearing loss:

Annual examination by a physician who is familiar with hereditary hearing impairment

Semiannual examination for hearing impairment and annual audiometry to assess stability of hearing loss (more frequent if fluctuation or progression is described by the affected individual)

Renal anomalies

Regular assessment of renal function to prevent progression to ESRD

Semiannual/annual examination by a nephrologist and/or urologist if indicated, based on level of renal function and type of renal and/or collecting system malformation
