The following are appropriate:

Routine assessment of growth in children

Periodic evaluation of chronic respiratory disease: spirometry (possible from age 6 years onwards), arterial blood gases, polysomnography, and a swallow study. Follow-up frequency depends on findings.

Regular monitoring of blood pressure and optimal management of blood pressure lability to help prevent some of the neurologic progression with age, which can be associated with compromised cerebral perfusion

Routine monitoring of other cardiovascular problems that can worsen with age (e.g., a greater degree of postural hypotension, worsening of supine hypertension, development of ischemic glomerulosclerosis, and cardiac arrhythmias) [Axelrod & Gold-von Simson 2007]

Monitoring for adequate hydration by measurement of blood urea nitrogen levels

Screening for sleep-disordered breathing with polysomnography

Periodic eye examination for strabismus, corneal opacities, or abnormal eye movements

Annual examination of the spine for early evidence of scoliosis to permit timely institution of bracing and exercise therapy

Periodic assessment of psychomotor development and behavior in children
