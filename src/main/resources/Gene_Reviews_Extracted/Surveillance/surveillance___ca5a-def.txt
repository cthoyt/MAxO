Follow up with a metabolic disease specialist every three to six months for physical and neurologic examinations. Consider neurodevelopmental testing and measurement of: plasma ammonia and amino acids (to check for chronic hyperammonemia and citrulline deficiency as well as general nutritional state); serum lactate and glucose; blood gases; liver parameters; and urine organic acids.
