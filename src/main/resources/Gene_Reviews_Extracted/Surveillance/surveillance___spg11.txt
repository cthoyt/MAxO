Specialized outpatient clinic evaluations are suggested every six months to adjust medication and physical rehabilitation.

Brain MRI can be used to follow the atrophy of the corpus callosum, cerebellum, and brain stem, and to monitor increases in the size and intensity of white matter hyperintensities.

Regular electrophysiologic investigations (e.g., ENMG, VEP, SEP) are recommended to follow the extent of the disease.
