For persons with pathogenic RECQL4 variants that correlate with an increased risk for osteosarcoma, attention to clinical findings such as bone pain, limp, and fracture is warranted. Currently no data are available regarding the effectiveness of routine screening such as x-rays, MRI, and bone scan. Furthermore, the risk of added radiation exposure from diagnostic studies and the benefit of "early" detection of osteosarcoma are unknown.

Because lymphoma has been observed in individuals with BGS [Debeljak et al 2009] and its allelic disorders RAPADILINO syndrome (4/14 cases) [Siitonen et al 2009] and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome [Simon et al 2010], it seems reasonable to monitor individuals for lymph node swelling and /or mediastinal enlargement on chest radiographs.
