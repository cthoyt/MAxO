There is no consensus on clinical surveillance; the following recommendations are provisional until a consensus conference is conducted.

Individuals with the clinical diagnosis of HLRCC, individuals with heterozygous pathogenic variants in FH without clinical manifestations, and at-risk family members who have not undergone molecular genetic testing should have the following regular surveillance by physicians familiar with the clinical manifestations of HLRCC.

Skin. Full skin examination is recommended annually to every two years to assess the extent of disease and to evaluate for changes suggestive of leiomyosarcoma.

Uterus. Annual gynecologic consultation is recommended to assess severity of uterine fibroids and to evaluate for changes suggestive of leiomyosarcoma.

Renal

Yearly examination with abdominal MRI is recommended for individuals with normal initial baseline or follow-up abdominal MRI. MRI is preferred because of the potential added radiation exposure associated with CT over lifetime. Abdominal CT scan with contrast should be reserved for when MRI is contraindicated.

Any suspicious renal lesion (indeterminate lesion, questionable or complex cysts) detected at a previous examination should be followed with a CT scan with and without contrast. The use of renal ultrasound examination is helpful in the characterization of cystic lesions. PET-CT may be added to identify metabolically active lesions suggesting possible malignant growth. Caution: Ultrasound examination alone is never sufficient.

Renal tumors should be evaluated by a urologic oncology surgeon familiar with the renal cancer of HLRCC.
