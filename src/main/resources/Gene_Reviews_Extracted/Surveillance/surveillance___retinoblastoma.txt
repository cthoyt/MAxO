Further information regarding medical surveillance for those who have had or are at risk of developing Rb is available in the guidelines for retinoblastoma care.

Detection of subsequent Rb after initial diagnosis. Following successful treatment, children require frequent follow-up examination for early detection of newly arising intraocular tumors:

It is recommended that children known to have an RB1 germline pathogenic variant have an eye examination under anesthesia every three to four weeks until age six months, then less frequently until age three years. Clinical examinations with cooperative children are performed every three to six months until age seven years, then annually and eventually biannually for life.

Individuals who have unilateral Rb without an identified heterozygous germline RB1 pathogenic variant are at risk for low-level mosaicism and can develop a tumor in the other eye [Rushlow et al 2009, Temming et al 2013]. This risk is small enough that examination under anesthesia may be replaced with regular clinical examination of the eyes, including clinical ultrasound (a simple, noninvasive procedure).

Individuals with retinomas (premalignant retinal lesions associated with Rb) are followed with retinal examinations and imaging every one to two years, to detect any change early.

Detection of second non-ocular tumors in individuals with retinoblastoma. Because of the high risk for second cancers, including sarcomas, melanoma, and specific other cancers, prompt investigation of any signs or symptoms is indicated. Total body MRI at regular intervals is under investigation to determine when the technology will be specific and sensitive enough for screening for second cancers in persons with a heterozygous germline RB1 pathogenic variant.
