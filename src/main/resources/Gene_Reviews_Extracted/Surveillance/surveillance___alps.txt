Clinical assessment, imaging, and laboratory studies outlined in Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis can be used in surveillance for manifestations of lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity.

Specialized imaging studies such as combined PET and CT scanning in combination with clinical and laboratory surveillance may be helpful in detection of malignant transformation, keeping in mind that PET/CT scanning is often abnormal in ALPS, such that distinguishing between “typical” ALPS findings and a new malignancy (lymphoma) can be difficult [Rao & Oliveira 2011]. Because of this, careful consideration of imaging modalities that expose the patient to radiation is warranted.
