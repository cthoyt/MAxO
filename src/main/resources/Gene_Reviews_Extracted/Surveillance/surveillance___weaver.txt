Regular review by a pediatrician is recommended for young children with EZH2-related Weaver syndrome to monitor developmental progress, camptodactyly (for resolution/improvement), and/or hypotonia.

If scoliosis is present, monitor as per the orthopedic recommendations.

The clinician may wish to review less frequently older children/teenagers who do not have medical complications.

Current data suggest that there may be a slightly increased relative risk for the development of neuroblastoma in individuals with heterozygous germline EZH2 pathogenic variants. Although the numbers are too small to quantify the absolute tumor risk, it appears to be low. In addition, given that neuroblastoma surveillance has been inconsistent with no data to support the modality of surveillance, screening interval or duration, the current recommendations include clinical vigilance and thorough investigation of any symptoms that may be tumor related.
