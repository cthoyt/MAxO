Ophthalmologic examination is recommended every one to two years to monitor disease progression. Examination should include visual field testing particularly as it relates to determination of driving eligibility and eligibility for government programs and/or disability.

Patients should be aware of the possibility of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and the option of self-monitoring using an Amsler grid under direction of their primary care ophthalmologist.
