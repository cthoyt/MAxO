The following are appropriate:

Regular cardiovascular follow up with echocardiography, and MRI- angiography or CT scan with 3D reconstructions from head to pelvis starting at birth or at the time of diagnosis, and repeated at regular intervals depending on the initial findings and the disease course. Under stable conditions (in the absence of aneurysms, stenosis, or dilatation of the aortic root), echocardiography could be performed on a yearly basis and MRI angiography or CT scan at least every three years in older children and adults.

Pulmonary hypertension may develop secondary to pulmonary artery stenosis, requiring regular echocardiographic follow-up.

Pulmonary follow up. Increased vigilance for emphysema is appropriate

Routine follow-up for refractive errors and keratoconus, when possible with an ophthalmologist with expertise in connective tissue disorders

Evaluation for orthopedic complications especially during periods of rapid growth (first two years of life and during puberty), e.g., serial radiographs to evaluate for progression of scoliosis

Orthodontic follow-up, especially during eruption of permanent dentition because of the increased risk of dental crowding secondary to palatal abnormalities
