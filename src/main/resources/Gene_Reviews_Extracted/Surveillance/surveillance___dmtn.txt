Periodic glucose tolerance tests can be used to assess insulin secretion. Most children with transient neonatal diabetes mellitus in remission have no evidence of beta cell dysfunction or insulin resistance in the fasting state. Insulin response to intravenous glucose loading is often normal but suggests future recurrence if abnormal [Shield et al 2004].

Measure growth (height, weight, head circumference) at regular intervals (i.e., at least every six months)

Developmental assessment to identify any special educational needs is appropriate.

Children with HIL need to be monitored for developmental delay and special educational needs.
