Hearing should be evaluated annually.

Annual ophthalmologic evaluation is indicated. (Although electroretinogram is useful in the diagnosis of a retinal dystrophy, it is not useful in follow up; visual field testing is much more helpful.)

Coagulation factors and other synthetic liver functions should be monitored. Persons with overt hepatic dysfunction require more routine monitoring.

The use of routine neuroimaging is uncertain. Individuals with peroxisomal disorders may develop a progressive leukodystrophy. No effective therapy exists, but identification of white matter changes may explain changes in cognitive and/or motor ability.
