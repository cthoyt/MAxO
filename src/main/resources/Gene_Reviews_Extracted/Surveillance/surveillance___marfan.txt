Eye. An annual ophthalmologic examination should include a specific assessment for glaucoma and cataracts.

Skeletal. Individuals with severe or progressive scoliosis should be followed by an orthopedist.

Cardiovascular. Echocardiography at frequent intervals to monitor the status of the ascending aorta is indicated:

Yearly examinations when the aortic dimension is relatively small and the rate of aortic dilation is relatively slow

More frequent examinations when the aortic root diameter exceeds approximately 4.5 centimeters in adults, the rate of aortic dilation exceeds approximately 0.5 cm per year, and significant aortic regurgitation is present

More frequent evaluations by a cardiologist are indicated with severe or progressive valve or ventricular dysfunction or with documented or suspected arrhythmia.

All individuals with Marfan syndrome should begin intermittent surveillance of the entire aorta with CT or MRA scans in young adulthood. Such imaging should be performed at least annually in anyone with a history of aortic root replacement or dissection.
