Because of the associated increased incidence of aortic or carotid dissection in PVNH, affected individuals should be screened by echocardiogram and cardiac MRI. There is insufficient data at present to provide definitive guidelines. However, given that such complications have occurred in early adulthood, it is reasonable to perform evaluation initially in late adolescence, with follow up as needed. Cardiology evaluation of those who have connective tissue findings and classic PVNH would be prudent.
