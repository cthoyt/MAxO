Height, weight, and head circumference should be monitored using achondroplasia-standardized growth curves.

Because an increased prevalence of mild-to-moderate intellectual disability and/or learning disabilities in children with hypochondroplasia appears likely, developmental milestones should be followed closely during early childhood and a timely referral to an appropriate professional made if there are any indications of learning difficulties during school-age years.

Neurologic examination for signs of spinal cord compression should be performed at routine well-child visits, with referral to a pediatric neurologist if needed.

History for evidence of sleep apnea should be taken at routine visits, with formal sleep study obtained when indicated.

MRI or CT examination of the foramen magnum is indicated if there is evidence of severe hypotonia, spinal cord compression or central sleep apnea.

Affected individuals should be evaluated for emerging leg bowing at routine visits, with orthopedic referral if bowing interferes with walking.
