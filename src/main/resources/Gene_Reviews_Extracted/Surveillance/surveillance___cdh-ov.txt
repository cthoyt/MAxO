Since both pre- and postnatal advances in treatment have increased survival of high-risk patients, it is important to provide close follow-up and support for potential long-term morbidities. Long-term follow-up for infants with CDH is ideally provided at a specialized center by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a pediatric surgeon, surgical nurse specialist, cardiologist, nutritionist, pulmonologist, and developmental pediatrician. This type of team can recognize, treat, and coordinate care for the many medical complications frequently found in long-term survivors with CDH.
