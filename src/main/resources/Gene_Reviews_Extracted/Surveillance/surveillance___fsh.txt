For those with a confirmed diagnosis of FSHD, the following surveillance applies:

Pain. Pain should be assessed at regular visits to primary care physicians and physical therapists.

Respiratory dysfunction

Affected individuals with moderate to severe FSHD, defined as those with proximal lower extremity weakness, should be routinely screened for hypoventilation.

Yearly forced vital capacity (FVC) measurements should be monitored for all affected individuals who are wheelchair bound, have pelvic girdle weakness and superimposed pulmonary disease, and/or have moderate to severe kyphoscoliosis, lumbar hyperlordosis, or chest wall deformities.

Hearing loss

As in children who are at risk for hearing loss for other reasons, hearing can be followed routinely by periodic assessment as part of school-based testing.

Hearing screens are particularly important in severe infantile onset forms of FSHD, as hearing loss can result in delayed language acquisition.

Adults should have a formal hearing evaluation based purely on symptoms. No additional audiometry screening of asymptomatic individuals is necessary.

Ophthalmologic disease

Annual dilated ophthalmoscopy in childhood is indicated.

In adults, a dilated retinal exam should be performed at the time of diagnosis; if vascular disease is absent, follow-up exams are only necessary if visual symptoms develop.

In children known to be at risk for FSHD (because of family history) but for whom the diagnosis has not yet been confirmed, annual dilated ophthalmoscopy is indicated.
