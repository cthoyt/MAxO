Wolfram syndrome. Regular evaluations including the following to detect manifestations that can occur with time:

Diabetes mellitus: tests of glucose tolerance

Optic atrophy: ophthalmologic examination

Sensorineural hearing loss: audiologic examination including speech discrimination testing

Neurologic deficits: neurologic examination including assessment of memory, personality changes

Psychiatric abnormalities: assessment for signs including depression, suicidal behavior, and changes in personal appearance and social behavior

Urologic abnormalities: urodynamic examination and assessment of ability to empty the bladder. Regular urine cultures when bladder dysfunction or other renal tract abnormality is present.

Diabetes insipidus: assessment of concentrating ability of the urine

Growth delay: monitoring of linear growth in children using standard growth charts

Hypogonadism

Puberty: monitoring for signs of onset of puberty

Once diabetes mellitus is present, regular follow-up for complications that can occur with time, including evaluations for:

Diabetic retinopathy

Microalbuminuria

Because women with WFS may develop diabetes insipidus during pregnancy [Rugolo et al 2002], monitoring for diabetes insipidus during pregnancy is warranted.

Low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss (LFSNHL). Regular audiologic examination including speech discrimination testing is appropriate.
