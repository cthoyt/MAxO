The following are indicated:

Complete blood counts several times a year

Bone marrow aspirate/biopsy to evaluate morphology and cellularity periodically and if evidence of another cytopenia or failure of current treatment is noted

Monitoring of blood pressure in individuals who are steroid dependent

Monitoring of growth individuals who are steroid dependent and in those at risk for transfusion iron overload

Evaluation by an endocrinologist; recommended for individuals who are steroid dependent and those at risk for transfusion iron overload

Cancer surveillance includes the following:

In individuals with DBA who are otherwise healthy, every four to six months: an interim history, physical examination, and measurement of blood count

If red blood-cell, white blood-cell, or platelet counts fall rapidly, bone marrow aspirate with biopsy and cytogenetic studies (including karyotype and FISH analysis) to look for acquired abnormalities in chromosomes 5, 7, and 8 that are associated with certain cancers [Vlachos et al 2008]
