The frequency of follow-up evaluations for persons with FPF depends largely on

the patient's individual diagnosis and status. Surveillance would follow the

guidelines for IPF [Raghu et

al 2011] or the specific type of IIP. Those who are stable may be

evaluated every three to six months, while others may need more frequent follow

up.

Pulmonary function studies including the following to serially monitor

disease course [Raghu

et al 2011]:

Forced vital capacity (FVC)

Diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO)

The six-minute walk test (6-MWT) distance and oxyhemoglobin

saturation change at baseline

Monitoring for progression of disease by HRCT of the chest

Oxygen saturation by resting pulse oximetry

Serologic monitoring for connective tissue disease (CTD) in patients

suspected of an underlying possibility for CTD-related ILD

Monitoring for any side effects known from pharmacologic treatments

Symptom control
