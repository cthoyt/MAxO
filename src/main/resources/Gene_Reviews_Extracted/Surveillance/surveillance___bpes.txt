The frequency of ophthalmic follow-up should be individualized depending on age, procedures performed in the past, and results of visual acuity testing.

Endocrinologic and gynecologic follow up are advised in females in whom the BPES type is unknown or in whom BPES type I is suspected based on a positive family history or FOXL2 pathogenic variant. Frequency of endocrinologic follow-up to monitor ovarian status is individualized and can involve pelvic ultrasound examination, measurement of serum FSH concentrations, and assessment of menstrual pattern (ages of menarche and onset of oligomenorrhea and secondary amenorrhea).
