For individuals with celiac disease, abnormal celiac disease serologies should be followed to normalization, which usually occurs within six to 12 months of starting a strict gluten-free diet.

Follow-up biopsy can be considered to confirm healing of intestinal villi. Because some patients on a strict gluten-free diet can heal gradually, this should typically be done at least two years after the initial diagnosis.

For asymptomatic relatives who have the HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 celiac disease-susceptibility haplotype on molecular genetic testing and negative antibody results, tTG IgA testing should be performed at three- to five-year intervals to screen for the development of celiac disease-associated antibodies [Hill et al 2005, NIH Consensus Committee 2005, Pietzak 2005].
