Because of clinical experience (albeit limited to date) with cardiac fibrosis in persons with complete PAI-1 deficiency [Flevaris et al 2017; Author, personal observation], screening echocardiogram can be considered beginning at age 15 years. In those with no cardiac findings, follow-up screening in two years is indicated; and in those with cardiac findings, follow up yearly or more frequently if indicated by a cardiologist [Ghosh et al 2010; Ghosh et al 2013; Author, personal observation].
