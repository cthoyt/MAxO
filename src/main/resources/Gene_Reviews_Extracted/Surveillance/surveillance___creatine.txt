For patients undergoing treatment:

Determination of cerebral creatine level by in vivo 1H-MRS should be performed:

For individuals with GAMT and AGAT deficiency to monitor cerebral creatine levels during creatine supplementation therapy;

For individuals with CRTR deficiency to monitor cerebral creatine levels for the assessment of treatment outcome [Mercimek-Mahmutoglu et al 2010b, van de Kamp et al 2012].

For GAMT deficiency: growth and nutritional status (plasma GAA levels, amino acids, ammonia, protein, albumin, pre-albumin levels) should be monitored every three to six months.

For CRTR deficiency: plasma GAA levels and plasma amino acids should be monitored every three to six months as high-dose arginine and glycine supplementation can result in increased GAA levels.

Repeat GFR annually for assessment of kidney function while on creatine supplementation therapy to detect possible creatine-associated nephropathy [Barisic et al 2002].

Perform neuropsychological assessment of cognitive functions and speech.
