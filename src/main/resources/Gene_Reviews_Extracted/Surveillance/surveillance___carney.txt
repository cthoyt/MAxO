Recommended clinical surveillance for individuals with CNC include the following:

Pre-pubertal pediatric individuals

Echocardiogram (annually; biannually for those with a history of excised myxoma)

Testicular ultrasound for boys; close monitoring of growth rate and pubertal staging (annually)

Post-pubertal pediatric and adult individuals

Echocardiogram (annually or biannually for adolescent individuals with a history of excised myxoma)

Testicular ultrasound (annually)

Thyroid ultrasound (baseline examination; may be repeated as needed)

Transabdominal ultrasound of the ovaries (baseline examination; may be repeated as needed)

Urinary free cortisol levels (annually)

Serum IGF-1 levels (annually)

Further evaluation of affected individuals of all age groups, as needed

For primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease, in addition to urinary free cortisol levels:

Diurnal cortisol levels (11:30 pm, 12:00 am and 7:30 am, 8:00 am sampling)

Dexamethasone-stimulation test (modified Liddleâ€™s test, as per Stratakis et al [1999])

Adrenal computed tomography

For gigantism/acromegaly, in addition to serum IGF-1 levels:

Pituitary MRI

Three-hour oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT)

90-minute thyroid releasing hormone (TRH) testing

For psammomatous melanotic schwannoma: MRI (brain, spine, chest, abdomen, retroperitoneum, pelvis)
