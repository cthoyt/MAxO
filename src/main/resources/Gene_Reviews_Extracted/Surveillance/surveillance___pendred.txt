Semiannual or annual examination by a physician familiar with hereditary hearing impairment

Semiannual or annual examination by an endocrinologist familiar with PDS

Repeat audiometry initially every three to six months if hearing loss is progressive

Since goiter is more common than hypothyroidism, volumetric baseline measurement of the thyroid, obtained by ultrasonography with periodic (every 2-3 years) reassessment [Choi et al 2011b]
