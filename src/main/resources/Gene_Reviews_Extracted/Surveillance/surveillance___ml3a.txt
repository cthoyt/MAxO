Young children with ML III alpha/beta and their families benefit from outpatient clinic visits about twice a year.

From age six years similar follow-up visits are recommended on a yearly basis unless bone pain and deteriorating ambulation become major handicaps and/or cardiac and respiratory monitoring need more frequent attention.
