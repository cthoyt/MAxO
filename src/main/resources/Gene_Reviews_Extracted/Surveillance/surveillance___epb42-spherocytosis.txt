Neonates with HS require monitoring of serum bilirubin concentration during the first week of life so that treatment for hyperbilirubinemia can be instituted promptly to avoid complications such as kernicterus.

Infants with HS require monitoring in the first two to four months of life for significant anemia, which may require RBC transfusion

Those dependent on frequent transfusions require at least annual measurement of serum ferritin concentration.

If iron chelation is required secondary to frequent transfusions in children too young to undergo splenectomy, appropriate monitoring for toxicity and effectiveness of chelation treatment is necessary [Musallam et al 2013].

When hemolysis is significant, ultrasound examination to evaluate for cholelithiasis is indicated by age ten to twelve years, and every five to ten years thereafter.
