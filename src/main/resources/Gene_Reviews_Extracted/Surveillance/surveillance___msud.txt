The authors recommend that infants with MSUD be evaluated by a pediatrician and metabolic specialist once monthly and have a full amino acid profile measured (either from plasma or filter paper) at least once a week. At the authors’ center, strict adherence to these guidelines by 15 Mennonite infants managed between 2005 and 2008 was associated with a 64% reduction in the overall hospitalization rate to 0.14 admissions per patient per year [Strauss et al 2010].

Children, adolescents, and adults also need to be followed closely and should ideally have amino levels monitored once per week. This is usually not practical without a “send-in” filter paper method.

The Denver Developmental Screening Test II or a comparable tool is useful for monitoring development of infants and young children with MSUD.

School-age children, adolescents, and adults should have neurocognitive testing if indicated by school performance or behavioral problems [Shellmer et al 2011, Muelly et al 2013]. Referral to a psychiatrist is appropriate for individuals who show signs of ADHD, anxiety, or depression.
