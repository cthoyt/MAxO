Appropriate surveillance includes the following:

Regular follow up with a child neurologist for seizure management

Regular follow up with a complex care/palliative care team or experienced pediatrician to monitor for complications associated with severe neurologic impairment (e.g., aspiration, constipation, contractures, pressure sores)

Periodic reevaluation with a clinical geneticist to review the most current information and recommendations for individuals with MIC-CAP syndrome
