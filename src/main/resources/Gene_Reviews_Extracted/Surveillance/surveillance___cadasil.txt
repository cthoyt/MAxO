There are no standard international surveillance guidelines for CADASIL. Several countries have developed CADASIL guidelines which can be referred to, such as the medical guideline for CADASIL published (in French) by the French Health Authority (HAS).

Yearly follow up by a neurologist with expertise in CADASIL is recommended from the time of diagnosis.

A consultation with a neuropsychiatrist is recommended when there are symptoms of depression or other psychiatric manifestations.

Consultation of other medical specialists (e.g., rehabilitation physician, physical therapist, and psychologist) is as required.

The interval at which individuals with CADASIL should be seen for follow up depends on the severity and type of symptoms and the needs of the patients and their care givers.
