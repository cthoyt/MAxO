The following are appropriate:

In individuals with renal abnormalities, monitoring of blood pressure and renal function.

In individuals with interim history of severe constipation, rectal biopsy to exclude Hirschsprung disease

Continuing surveillance for manifestations that would establish the diagnosis of BBS including the following:

Serial growth measurements to track height and weight until at least age five years to document obesity that can occur with BBS

Developmental assessments until at least age five years to detect developmental disabilities that can occur with BBS

Regular ophthalmologic examination and electroretinogram (ERG) (if appropriate) after age five years to evaluate for visual signs and symptoms of retinitis pigmentosa [A Verloes, personal communication]

As diabetes mellitus is a rare complication of BBS, measurement of fasting blood glucose as appropriate

Investigations for rarer complications of BBS, including hearing assessment, dental assessment, electroencephalogram, and thyroid function tests as appropriate

Consideration of later complications of surgery for HMC, including recurrent urinary tract infections and re-stenosis and infection of the vaginal tract [Lueth & Wood 2014]. Surveillance as appropriate for each individual is recommended.
