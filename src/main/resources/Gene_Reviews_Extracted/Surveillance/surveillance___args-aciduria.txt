Regular monitoring of the concentration of plasma amino acids to identify deficiency of essential amino acids as well as impending hyperammonemia is indicated. The appropriate intervals for monitoring depend on the clinical scenario, but need to be more frequent in neonates and in those with frequent metabolic decompensations. The authors prefer to evaluate neonates every one to two weeks, infants between age two months and one year every one to three months, and children older than age two years every three to four months.

Early signs of impending hyperammonemic episodes in older individuals include mood changes, headache, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, refusal to feed, ankle clonus, and elevated plasma concentrations of glutamine, alanine, and glycine. Plasma glutamine concentration may rise 48 hours in advance of increases in plasma ammonia concentration in such individuals.

Follow up in a metabolic clinic with a qualified metabolic dietician and clinical biochemical geneticist is preferred when possible.

Annual measurement of blood pressure using the appropriate-sized cuff and plotting the centile values for age and stature is indicated.

Periodic evaluation of liver function tests may be necessary; the appropriate frequency is unknown.

Periodic evaluation of serum electrolytes is appropriate; the frequency unknown.
