If no abnormalities are found on echocardiogram in an adult, a follow-up echocardiogram is not necessary. (Because longitudinal data on progression of aortic dilation are not available, specific recommendations for follow-up in individuals with a normal aortic diameter are not available.)

Yearly echocardiogram is warranted if an abnormality such as aortic dilatation or mitral valve prolapse is present.
