Plasma Phe and Tyr concentrations in individuals with classic PKU must be monitored regularly [National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Panel 2001] (see Treatment of Manifestations).

In infants, frequent in-clinic visits are recommended until Phe levels are stabilized, followed by weekly blood level monitoring of Phe and tyrosine levels until age one with closer monitoring during periods of rapid growth or diet transitions. In addition, plasma amino acid levels should be regularly monitored to foster optimal growth during the first year of life.

Between ages one and 12 years, biweekly to monthly sampling may be adequate.

In adolescents and adults who are stable and well controlled, blood level monitoring can be monthly.

Nutritional assessment should include growth evaluation and assessment of micronutrient intake and needs.

Some clinics perform monitoring of plasma amino acids, transthyretin, complete blood count, ferritin, and 25-OH vitamin D every six months in infants and annually thereafter even if growth is appropriate and analysis of the diet shows adequate intake.

If there is evidence for suboptimal dietary intake or over-reliance on nutritionally incomplete medical foods, evaluation of plasma amino acids (full panel), transthyretin, albumin, complete blood count, ferritin, 25-OH vitamin D, electrolytes, renal function, liver function, albumin, vitamin B12, red blood cell essential fatty acids, trace minerals (zinc, copper, selenium), vitamin A, and folic acid should be considered [Singh et al 2014, Vockley et al 2014].

Assessment of developmental milestones and overall developmental progress should take place at every visit.

Screening for mental illness should be considered at every visit and performed at regular intervals by primary care providers.
