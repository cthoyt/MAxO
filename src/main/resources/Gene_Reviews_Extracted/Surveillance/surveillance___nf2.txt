For at-risk individuals (1) in whom the known pathogenic variant in the family has been identified or (2) whose genetic status cannot be clarified by molecular genetic testing:

MRI is usually begun between ages ten and 12 years but can be delayed in families in which the onset is known to be later [Evans et al 2005a]. MRI should be continued on an annual basis until at least the fourth decade of life. It is not clear if earlier surveillance (i.e., cranial MRI before age 10 years) is beneficial, and it is not known at what age monitoring can be safely stopped. Although some individuals with NF2 do not have symptoms until they are in their fifties, it is likely that "silent" tumors would be detected on an MRI performed at a younger age.

Hearing evaluation, including BAER testing, may be useful in detecting changes in auditory nerve function before changes can be visualized by MRI.

Routine complete eye examinations should be part of the care of all individuals with NF2.
