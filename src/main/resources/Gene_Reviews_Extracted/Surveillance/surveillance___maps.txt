Individuals with Biallelic Germline 

In the US-based National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines [NCCN 2012]:

Pan colonoscopy should be performed every one to two years beginning at age 25-30 years. Following surgery, endoscopy of any remaining colon or rectum should be performed every one to two years.

Upper endoscopy and side viewing duodenoscopy should be performed every three to five years beginning at age 30-35 years.

At this time there is no consensus regarding screening intervals for thyroid abnormalities [LaGuardia et al 2011].

Regarding extraintestinal malignancies, to date no specific surveillance beyond existing protocols that are offered to the general population in most Western countries is recommended.

In Europe:

Recommended ages at which screening should begin differ based on the consensus meeting in Mallorca [Vasen et al 2008] (full text; registration or institutional access required):

Pan colonoscopy beginning at age 18-20 years

Upper endoscopy with side viewing duodenoscopy beginning at age 25-30 years

Recommended intervals between screenings depend on disease severity [Spigelman et al 1989]

Individuals Heterozygous for a Germline 

NCCN guidelines do not propose specific screening recommendations for individuals heterozygous for a germline MUTYH pathogenic variant.

Available data suggest that heterozygous relatives of individuals with MAP have a two- or at most threefold increase in their risk for colorectal cancer at an age similar to that in the general population (see Clinical Description, MUTYH heterozygotes). Thus, they are expected to benefit from population screening measures or could be offered average moderate-risk colorectal screening based on their family history [Jones et al 2009].
