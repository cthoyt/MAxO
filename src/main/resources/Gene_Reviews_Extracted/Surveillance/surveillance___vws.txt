Neonatal period and infancy

Weekly assessment of nutritional intake and weight gain during the first month of life

Otolaryngologic evaluation

Audiologic evaluation

Assessment of prelinguistic speech-language development

Dental evaluation

Consultation with other specialists as applicable

Longitudinal evaluation and treatment

Audiologic evaluation as soon as possible in a neonate and again at the time of an infant’s first visit to a cleft clinic. The timing and frequency of follow-up evaluations should be based on the individual’s history of ear disease or hearing loss. Evaluations should be carried out routinely through adolescence.

Dental evaluation at an infant’s first visit to the cleft clinic and within six months of the first tooth erupting, no later than age 12 months. Routine dental evaluation should continue throughout life.

Otolaryngologic evaluation at an infant’s first visit to the cleft clinic and within the first six months of life. These evaluations should continue throughout adolescence.

Speech-language pathology evaluation at an infant’s first visit to the cleft clinic to provide parents with information about speech and language development. By age six months, infants should be seen for assessment of prelinguistic speech-language development. During the first two years of life, children should be evaluated at least twice, and then at least annually until age six years. After age six years, evaluations should be at least annually until after adenoid involution, and then at least every two years until dental and skeletal maturity.
