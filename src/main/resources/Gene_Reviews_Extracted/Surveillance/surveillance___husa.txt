Individuals with known aHUS. Measure serum concentration of hemoglobin, platelet count, and serum concentrations of creatinine, LDH, C3, and C4, and haptoglobin:

Every month in the first year after an aHUS episode, then every three to six months in the following years, particularly for persons with normal renal function or chronic renal insufficiency as they are at risk for relapse. Note: Individuals with ESRD usually do not relapse.

Every two weeks for those rare individuals with homozygous CFH pathogenic variants that result in very low or undetectable levels of the CFH protein

Note: The proposed time intervals for checking hemoglobin, platelet count, and serum concentrations of creatinine, LDH, C3, C4, and haptoglobin are suggestions [Authors, personal observation]; each center may follow different guidelines based on their own experience.
