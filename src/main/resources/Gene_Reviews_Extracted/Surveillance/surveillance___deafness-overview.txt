Sequential audiologic examinations are essential to:

Document the stability or progression of the hearing loss;

Identify and treat superimposed hearing losses, such as middle ear effusion.

In a person with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss caused by pathogenic variants in SLC26A4, the hearing loss can progress and annual audiometric testing may be warranted. Additionally, thyroid function should be followed if the diagnosis is consistent with Pendred syndrome.
