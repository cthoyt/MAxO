Affected individuals should be monitored at regular intervals to detect any clinical complications that may develop, to assess dietary compliance, and to measure plasma total homocysteine and methionine concentrations. Infants should be monitored monthly for the first six months of life and bimonthly until age one year, then every three months until age three years. Semiannual monitoring through the remainder of childhood and annual monitoring in adolescence and adulthood are indicated. Complications should be promptly addressed with appropriate therapy.

Plasma total homocysteine and methionine concentrations should be monitored in all persons receiving betaine (see Prevention of Primary Manifestations, Betaine treatment).

Vitamin B12 and folate levels should be monitored.

Regular ophthalmology assessments can identify eye complications such as progressive myopia and ectopia lentis and allow for early treatment and prevention of further complications such as retinal detachment.

DXA scans should be performed every three to five years following adolescence to monitor for osteoporosis [Morris et al 2017].
