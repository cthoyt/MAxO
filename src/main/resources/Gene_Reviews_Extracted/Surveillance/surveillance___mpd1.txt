After establishing the diagnosis (see Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis) and instituting the indicated therapies (see Treatment of Manifestations), annual review is recommended.

Additional recommendations include:

Spinal review for evidence of scoliosis and/or kyphoscoliosis, especially during the years of rapid growth in adolescence;

Repeat electrocardiogram and echocardiogram if symptoms of cardiac insufficiency occur;

Respiratory function and assessment if symptoms suggest either sleep apnea or sleep-related respiratory insufficiency.
