Appropriate surveillance includes:

Annual pulmonary assessment, including pulmonary function testing if able to be performed;

Polysomnography every one to three years unless symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing are present on history;

Spinal examination for signs of scoliosis, particularly in late childhood and adolescence;

Annual ophthalmologic exams for ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and myopia;

Assessment for dental malocclusion, with referral for orthodontia if indicated.

Currently, the risk for non-neurologic events including bleeding diatheses and gastrointestinal complications is uncertain. Furthermore, the benefit of screening tests for such abnormalities has yet to be determined or systematically studied. Potential screening tests include the following:

Annual blood counts [Herman et al 1999]

Annual liver function test and abdominal ultrasound to address the potential risk of peliosis hepatis [Herman et al 1999]
