Affected individuals and their at-risk relatives should be followed at regular intervals (e.g. every 6-12 months initially) to monitor progression of disease and the appearance of new symptoms.

Annual neurologic, ophthalmologic, cardiology (electrocardiogram and echocardiogram), and endocrinologic evaluations (fasting blood sugar and TSH) are recommended.

If normal for three years, less frequent evaluations can be considered.
