Individuals should be evaluated regularly by a team comprising otologists, ophthalmologists, neurologists, physiatrists, and physical and occupational therapists to determine neurologic status and functional disability. While profound hearing loss begins during infancy, optic neuropathy and peripheral neuropathy in CMTX5 vary in age of onset of manifestations and progression. Thus, regular ophthalmologic and neurologic exams are warranted to monitor symptom development and progression.
