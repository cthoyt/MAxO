The frequency of follow-up neurologic evaluations depends on the degree of ptosis, dysphagia, and muscle weakness.

Perform routine ophthalmologic evaluation o determine if ptosis interferes with driving or is associated with neck pain, and or if the eyelids cover more than 50% of the pupil, findings that might lead to consideration of surgical intervention.

Perform routine reevaluation for functional signs of dysphagia using videoscopy and fiberoscopy.
