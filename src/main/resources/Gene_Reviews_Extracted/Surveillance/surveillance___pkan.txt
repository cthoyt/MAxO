As the disease progresses, episodes of extreme distress may last for days or weeks. It is especially important during these episodes to evaluate for treatable causes of pain. These may include occult GI bleeding, urinary tract infections, mouth lacerations, and occult bone fractures. The combination of osteopenia in a nonambulatory individual with marked stress on long bones from dystonia places individuals with PKAN at especially high risk for fractures without apparent trauma.

The following should be performed on a regular basis:

Monitoring of height and weight using appropriate growth curves to screen children for worsening nutritional status

Ophthalmologic assessment

Oral assessment for consequences of trauma

Assessment of ambulation, environmental adaptations, speech abilities, and communication needs to help affected individuals to maintain independence

Swallowing evaluation and regular dietary assessments to assure adequate nutrition
