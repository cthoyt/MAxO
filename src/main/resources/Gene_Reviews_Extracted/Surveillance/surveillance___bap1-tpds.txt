Consensus management recommendations have not been established; however, several groups have proposed variations of the following [Carbone et al 2012, Battaglia 2014, Rai et al 2016]:

Uveal melanoma. Yearly dilated eye examinations and imaging by an ocular oncologist beginning around age 11 years

Malignant mesothelioma. No reliable early disease symptoms or screening modalities

Annual evaluation is recommended for late manifestations of mesothelioma, which can include chest pain, cough, fever, shortness of breath, dysphagia, hoarseness, weight loss, fever, upper body and face edema (chest mesothelioma) and abdominal pain, ascites, nausea, vomiting, and/or constipation (peritoneal mesothelioma). Annual physical examination is recommended to look for signs of pleurisy (pleural inflammation), peritonitis, ascites and/or pleural effusion.

If an abdominal MRI is to be performed as recommended for ccRCC, consider evaluation of the peritoneum and pleura as well. Although some physicians recommend spiral chest CT for asymptomatic persons with a history of exposure to asbestos, others do not, given the possible increased risk of cancer from radiation exposure.

Cutaneous melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and atypical Spitz tumors. Annual full body dermatologic examinations beginning around age 20 years

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Protocol similar to von Hippel Lindau disease with annual abdominal ultrasound examination; consideration of annual urinalysis and abdominal MRI every two years
