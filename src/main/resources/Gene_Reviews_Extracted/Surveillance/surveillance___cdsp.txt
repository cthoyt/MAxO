The following evaluations have been suggested [Magoulas & El-Hattab 2012]:

Echocardiogram and electrocardiogram. Perform annually during childhood and less frequently in adulthood. Individuals with cardiomyopathy require management and follow up by specialists in cardiology.

Plasma carnitine concentration. Monitor frequently until levels reach the normal range, thereafter, measure three times a year during infancy and early childhood, twice a year in older children, and annually in adults.

Serum CK concentration and liver transaminases. Consider measuring during acute illnesses.
