Management



Treatment of Manifestations



Reviews of treatment approaches to CMT are available [Carter et al 2008, Young et al 2008, Reilly & Shy 2009]. Reviews of the diagnosis, natural history and management are available [Pareyson & Marchesi 2009a, Pareyson & Marchesi 2009b].

Treatment is symptomatic. Affected individuals are often evaluated and managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes neurologists, physiatrists, orthopedic surgeons, and physical and occupational therapists [Carter et al 2004, Grandis & Shy 2005]. Quality of life has been measured and compared among various groups of individuals with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) [Vinci et al 2005a, Burns et al 2010]. Persistent weakness of the hands and/or feet has important career and employment implications; anticipatory counseling is appropriate.

Special shoes, including those with good ankle support, may be needed. Affected individuals often require ankle/foot orthoses (AFOs) to correct foot drop and aid walking.

Some individuals require forearm crutches or canes for gait stability; fewer than 5% of individuals need wheelchairs.

Exercise is encouraged within the individual's capability and many individuals remain physically active.

Orthopedic surgery may be required to correct severe pes cavus deformity [Guyton & Mann 2000, Guyton 2006, Casasnovas et al 2008, Ward et al 2008]. Surgery is sometimes required for hip dysplasia [Chan et al 2006].

The cause of any pain should be identified as accurately as possible [Padua et al 2006].

Musculoskeletal pain may respond to acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents [Carter et al 1998].

Neuropathic pain may respond to tricyclic antidepressants or drugs such as carbamazepine or gabapentin.

Modafinil has been used to treat fatigue [Carter et al 2006].

Prevention of Secondary Complications



Daily heel cord stretching exercises to prevent Achilles' tendon shortening are desirable, as well as gripping exercises for hand weakness [Vinci et al 2005b].

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid



Obesity is to be avoided because it makes walking more difficult.

Medications that are toxic or potentially toxic to persons with CMT comprise a spectrum of risk ranging from definite high risk to negligible risk. Click here (pdf) for an up-to-date list.

Chemotherapy for cancer that includes vincristine may be especially damaging to peripheral nerves and severely worsen CMT [Graf et al 1996, Nishikawa et al 2008].

Therapies Under Investigation



Patel & Pleasure [2013] and Ekins et al [2015] have summarized the potential treatment approaches to CMT1.

Dyck et al [1982], Ginsberg et al [2004], and Carvalho et al [2005] have described a few individuals with CMT1 and sudden deterioration in whom treatment with steroids (prednisone) or IVIg has produced variable levels of improvement. Nerve biopsy has shown lymphocytic infiltration. One such family had a specific MPZ pathogenic variant (p.Ile99Thr) [Donaghy et al 2000]. A young child with CMT1A and an inflammatory neuropathy has been reported [Marques et al 2010].

Sahenk et al [2003] are studying the effects of neurotrophin-3 on individuals with CMT1A.

Passage et al [2004] reported benefit from ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in a mouse model of CMT1. However, a study of 277 persons with CMT1A found no significant effect of a daily 1.5-g dose of ascorbic acid after two years [Pareyson et al 2011]. Similar studies of smaller numbers of patients have also shown no benefit of such treatment [Micallef et al 2009, Verhamme et al 2009]. Lewis et al [2013] also found no positive treatment response to ascorbic acid vs. placebo in 110 subjects with CMT1A.

Sereda et al [2003] and Meyer zu Horste et al [2007] used a progesterone antagonist to improve neuropathy in a transgenic rat model of CMT1A.

Night splints have not improved ankle range of motion [Refshauge et al 2006].
