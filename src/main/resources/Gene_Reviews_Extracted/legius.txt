Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis



To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual with a confirmed molecular diagnosis of Legius syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended:

Age-appropriate developmental assessment

Neuropsychiatric evaluation on entry into school system or sooner based on clinical findings

Detailed dermatologic evaluation for supportive findings

Clinical genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations



The following are appropriate:

Consideration of behavioral modification or pharmacologic adjuvant therapy for individuals with ADHD

Adjuvant therapies such as physical, speech, and occupational therapy for individuals with identified developmental delays

Individualized education plans for learning disorders and school performance issues

Prevention of Secondary Complications



Age-appropriate developmental assessment and neuropsychiatric evaluations could potentially result in the initiation of therapies to prevent developmental and behavioral complications.

Surveillance



Consider periodic evaluation by a clinical geneticist to discuss manifestations associated with disorders of the Ras/MAPK pathway that may eventually be associated with Legius syndrome

Routine screening for developmental delays and behavioral and learning problems is appropriate.

Although vascular abnormalities have been reported in a few individuals with Legius syndrome, hypertension has not been reported. However, given the prevalence of vascular abnormalities and hypertension in NF1, it would seem appropriate to have regular blood pressure monitoring at each physician visit.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk



Using molecular genetic testing for the SPRED1 pathogenic variant found in the proband, it is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk (e.g., parents, younger and older sibs of a proband) with caf√© au lait macules to identify as early as possible those who could benefit from institution of treatment and preventive measures.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Therapies Under Investigation
