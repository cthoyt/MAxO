The following should be avoided:

Barbiturates. Generally, children with infantile-onset seizures are treated with phenobarbital, the most commonly used antiepileptic drug in this age group. In vitro studies indicate that barbiturates aggravate the Glut1 transport defect in erythrocytes of individuals with Glut1-DS [Klepper et al 1999a]. On occasion, parents have reported that phenobarbital did not improve their childâ€™s seizure control or may have worsened their child's clinical condition.

Methylxanthines (e.g., caffeine), which are known to inhibit transport of glucose by Glut1 [Ho et al 2001b], also have been reported to worsen the clinical state of individuals with Glut1-DS [Brockmann et al 2001]. Thus, it is advisable for affected individuals to avoid coffee and other caffeinated beverages.

Valproic acid. The following studies suggest that valproic acid effects in vitro are mixed and the clinical consequences of valproic acid usage in patients with Glut1-DS cannot be predicted.

Valproic acid inhibited Glut1 transport activity in normal and Glut1-deficient erythrocytes by 20%-30%. In primary astrocytes as well as in normal and Glut1-deficient fibroblasts, sodium valproate inhibited glucose transport by 20%-40%, accompanied by an up to 60% down-regulation of GLUT1 mRNA expression [Wong et al 2005].

A study using cultured astrocytes from the Glut1-DS mouse model showed an upregulation of Glut1 activity at lower valproic acid concentrations presumably from the valproic acid associated inhibition of histone deacetylase activity [Kim et al 2013].
