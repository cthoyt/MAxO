Excessive heat may exacerbate blistering and infection in EBS.

Poorly fitting or coarse-textured clothing and footwear can cause trauma and should be avoided.

Avoiding activities that traumatize the skin (e.g., hiking, mountain biking, contact sports) can reduce skin damage, but affected individuals who are determined to find ways to participate in these endeavors should be encouraged.

Many individuals with EBS cannot use ordinary medical tape or Band-AidsÂ®.
