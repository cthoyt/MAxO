Vitamin E may adversely affect the course of RP; thus, it is recommended that individuals with RP avoid high-dose supplements (e.g., 400 IU/d) [Berson 2000].

Increased exposure to light has been demonstrated to accelerate progression in animal models of retinitis pigmentosa, particularly those with pathogenic variants in the gene encoding rhodopsin [Naash et al 1996, LaVail et al 1999]; thus, avoidance of bright light and use of UV-blocking sunglasses are recommended for all patients with RP.

Smoking has been demonstrated as a strong risk factor for age-related macular degeneration [Seddon et al 1996, Chew et al 2013], and is thought to contribute to retinal damage in retinitis pigmentosa and other inherited retinal degenerations as well; thus, avoidance of smoking is recommended for all patients with RP.

Pregnancy Management

Women of childbearing age need to be cautioned about potential teratogenic effects of high-dose vitamin A palmitate (see Therapies Under Investigation) to the developing fetus. See Clinical Manifestations for further information about possible progression of disease during pregnancy.
