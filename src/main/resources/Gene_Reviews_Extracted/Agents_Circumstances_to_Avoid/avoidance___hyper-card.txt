Affected individuals are advised to use moderation in all physical activities. Physical activity guidelines have been established to detail reasonable exercise restrictions for people with familial HCM [Maron et al 2004, Gersh et al 2011]:

Avoid competitive endurance training and participation in recreational activities that require an intensity level similar to competitive athletics.

Avoid burst activities, like sprinting, as well as intense isometric exercise, such as heavy weight lifting.

Avoid exercise in extreme environmental conditions and maintain adequate hydration.

To avoid exacerbation of obstructive physiology and worsening of symptoms, patients with outflow tract obstruction should be particularly careful in alcohol consumption; use Jacuzzis, steam rooms, saunas with caution; and avoid the following:

Dehydration/hypovolemia (therefore, diuretics must be used with caution)

Medications that decrease afterload (e.g., ACE inhibitors; angiotensin receptor blockers and other direct vasodilators including dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers)

Medications for erectile dysfunction (e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil)

Cautious use of stimulant medications may be considered in children diagnosed with HCM only after other treatment methods have been explored. Children with HCM undergoing treatment with stimulants should be carefully monitored by a pediatric cardiologist [Vetter et al 2008].
