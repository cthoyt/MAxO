Contact sports and other high-risk activities should be avoided in patients with significant skeletal involvement.

Prophylactic optic nerve decompression increases vision loss in patients with craniofacial FD and is contraindicated [Lee et al 2002, Amit et al 2011].

Surgical removal of ovarian cysts should be performed with caution and only in limited circumstances.

Radiation therapy is not indicated for treatment of FD, and radiation exposure to FD lesions should be limited due to potential risk for malignant transformation [Ruggieri et al 1994].

While a strong association between gsp mutations (i.e., activating GNAS mutations at residues Arg201 and Gln227) and malignancies in FD/MAS is lacking, it is prudent to minimize additional risk factors (e.g., radiation exposure) and encourage vigilance and monitoring.
