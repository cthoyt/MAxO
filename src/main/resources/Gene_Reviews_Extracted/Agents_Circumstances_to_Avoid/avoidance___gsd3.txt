Avoid the following:

High sugar intake as excess sugar is stored as glycogen, which cannot be broken down

Steroid-based drugs as they interfere with glucose metabolism and utilization. Long-term steroid usage itself can cause muscle weakness.

Growth hormone replacement therapy as it interferes with glucose metabolism, worsens ketosis, and may theoretically cause liver adenomas to grow

Use the following with caution:

Hormonal contraceptives in women as they can cause hepatic adenoma formation

Statins for control of hyperlipidemia. Use of statins requires CK monitoring because of the potential of exacerbating the muscle disease of GSD IIIa.

Beta blockers as they can induce hypoglycemia
