In individuals with epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spike-and-wave during sleep (ECSWS), phenytoin, barbiturates and carbamazepine should be avoided as they are rarely effective, may worsen the EEG, and have negative effects on neuropsychological outcomes [Striano & Capovilla 2013, Van Bogaert 2013].
