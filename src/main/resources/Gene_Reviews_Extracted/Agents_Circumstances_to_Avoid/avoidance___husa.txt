Discontinue cyclosporine or tacrolimus when aHUS develops following challenge with the medication.

Fresh frozen plasma should be avoided (i.e., plasma therapy is contraindicated) in persons with aHUS induced by Streptococcus pneumoniae because plasma from an adult contains antibodies against the Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen, which may exacerbate the disease. It is preferable to transfuse washed red blood cells or platelets. There is no evidence that plasmapheresis is of value [Copelovitch & Kaplan 2008].

Avoid potential precipitants of aHUS, including the following known triggers of aHUS:

Pregnancy

Medications. Some chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., mitomycin C, cisplatin, daunorubimicin, cytosine arabinoside), immunotherapeutic agents (e.g., cyclosporin and tacrolimus), antiplatelet agents (e.g., ticlopidine and clopidogrel), oral contraceptives, and anti-inflammatory agents
