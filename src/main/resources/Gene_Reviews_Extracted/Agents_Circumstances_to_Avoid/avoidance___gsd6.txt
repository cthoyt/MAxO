Avoid the following:

Excessive amounts of simple sugars to prevent excessive hepatic glycogen deposition

Glucagon administration as a rescue therapy for hypoglycemia because blood glucose concentrations will not increase

Growth hormone for short stature because it usually exacerbates ketosis and often is not efficacious

When hepatomegaly is present, contact sports (or use appropriate cautions)
