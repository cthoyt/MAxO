No adverse drug effects have been documented in Rotor syndrome; however, the absence of the hepatic proteins OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 may have serious consequences for liver uptake and toxicity of numerous commonly used drugs and/or their metabolites which enter the liver via either of the two OATP1B transporters.

A list of drugs that enter the liver mainly via OATP1B1 and whose pharmacokinetics are known to be influenced by genetic variability in SLCO1B1 has been published [Niemi et al 2011]. Some of these drugs are also taken up by OATP1B3 [Shitara 2011]. The list includes:

Statins – simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin, puitavastatin, rosuvastatin, fluvastatin

Ezetimibe

Anticancer drugs - methotrexate and irinotecan

Sartans – olmesartan and valsartan

Rifampicin

Mycophenolic acid

Torsemide

Thiazolidine diones – pioglitazone and rosiglitazone

Glinides – nateglinide and repaglinide

Lopinavir

Fexofenadine
