Avoid the following:

All food products containing phytanic acid such as ruminant (cow, sheep, and goat) products and certain fish (cod) products. Some nuts should also be avoided [Brown et al 1993].

Fasting because stored lipids, including phytanic acid, are mobilized into the plasma

Ibuprofen because it is metabolized by AMACR and may interfere with the metabolism of phytanic acid

Amiodarone because of the risk that hyperthyroidism would induce enhanced catabolism, with consequent increase of plasma phytanic acid
