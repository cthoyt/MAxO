Persons with generalized epimerase deficiency galactosemia should be on a galactose/lactose-restricted diet, certainly as infants and perhaps for life.

Persons with intermediate epimerase deficiency galactosemia may be placed on a galactose/lactose-restricted diet, either transiently or long-term. Assessment of hemolysate gal-1P and/or urinary galactitol following a galactose challenge (e.g., 2 weeks on a normal diet) may help determine if an individual should remain on a galactose/lactose-restricted diet for longer periods of time.
