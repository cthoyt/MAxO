Although adverse events with specific agents have not been reported in persons with SRD, several should be avoided on a theoretic basis including:

Sulfa drugs, which impair BH4 biosynthesis by inhibiting sepiapterin reductase [Haruki et al 2013]

Methotrexate, which inhibits dihydropteridine reductase, an enzyme involved in BH4 regeneration [Woody & Brewster 1990]

Nitrous oxide, which may impair folate metabolism [Wyatt & Gill 1999]

Neuroleptics and other dopamine antagonists (e.g., metoclopramide)
