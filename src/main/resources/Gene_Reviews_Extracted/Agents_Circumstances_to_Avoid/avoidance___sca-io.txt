Valproate is contraindicated in patients with IOSCA, as it is in other disorders that potentially affect mitochondrial function in liver. Valproate caused significant elevation of liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase [ALAT] 232 units/L [normal: 10-35 U/L] and gamma-GT [GGT] 160 U/L [normal: 5-50 U/L]) and icterus with elevated bilirubin levels (total: 224 µmol/L [normal: 5-25 µmol/L]; conjugated: 160 µmol/L [normal:1-8 µmol/L]) in one patient, and similar elevation of liver transaminases in another. When valproate was discontinued, icterus disappeared and the liver enzymes normalized.
