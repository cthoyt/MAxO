In general, anesthesia should be used with caution [Bandschapp & Laizzo 2013]. Particular care must be taken with the use of depolarizing muscle relaxants during anesthesia because they may cause adverse anesthesia-related events. Because life-threatening muscle spasms and secondary ventilation difficulties occurred following a preoperative injection of suxamethonium, Farbu et al [2003] recommended that suxamethonium be avoided in individuals with myotonia congenita.

Note: Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants appear to act normally in individuals with myotonia congenita but do not counteract a myotonic response caused by suxamethonium [Farbu et al 2003].

In rare cases, injections of adrenaline or selective beta-adrenergic agonists in high doses may aggravate myotonia.

The beta-antagonist propranolol has likewise been reported to worsen myotonia [Blessing & Walsh 1977]. Accordingly, beta-agonists and beta-antagonists should be used with caution and particular care should be taken with the use of intravenous fenoterol or ritodrine.

Colchicine may cause a myopathy with myotonia in individuals with renal insufficiency [Rutkove et al 1996] and may thus also, in theory, aggravate the myotonia of individuals with myotonia congenita.
