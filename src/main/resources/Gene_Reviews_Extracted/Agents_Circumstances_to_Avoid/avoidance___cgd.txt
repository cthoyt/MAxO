Exposures. Activities that expose the affected person to decayed organic matter (e.g., mulching, gardening, leaf raking, house demolition) are to be avoided as inhalation of fungal spores can result in fulminant pneumonitis leading to hypoxia and respiratory failure [Siddiqui et al 2007]. Therefore, the following should be avoided:

Exposure to mulch

Potting of plants or gardening

Raking leaves or mowing lawns

Swimming in stagnant water, brackish water, or ponds

BCG vaccination should be avoided (live viral vaccines are likely safe).

Transfusion considerations. Persons with CGD and McLeod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome lack red blood cell Kell antigens and thus should not receive blood transfusions that are Kell antigen positive.
