Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists (e.g., metoclopramide and veralipride) and β-adrenergic receptor antagonists (β-blockers) have a high potential to cause an adverse reaction in individuals with pheochromocytoma.

Other medications including monoamine oxidase inhibitors, sympathomimetics (e.g., ephedrine), and certain peptide and corticosteroid hormones may also cause complications; tricyclic antidepressants are inconsistent in causing adverse reactions [Eisenhofer et al 2007].
