Poorly fitting or coarse-textured clothing and footwear should be avoided as they can cause trauma.

In general, activities that traumatize the skin (e.g., hiking, mountain biking, contact sports) should be avoided; affected individuals who are committed to participation in such activities should be encouraged to devise ways of protecting the skin.

Most persons with DEB cannot use ordinary medical tape or Band-AidsÂ®.
