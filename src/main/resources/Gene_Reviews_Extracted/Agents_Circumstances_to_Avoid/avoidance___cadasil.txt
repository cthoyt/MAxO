Angiography and anticoagulants are contraindicated in CADASIL as they may provoke cerebrovascular accidents [Lesnik Oberstein et al 2001].

Smoking increases the risk of stroke in individuals with CADASIL and should be avoided [Singhal et al 2004].

Thrombolytic therapy (intravenous thrombolysis) is contraindicated because of the presumed increased risk for cerebral hemorrhage in view of the fact that patients with CADASIL have microbleeds on MRI [Lesnik Oberstein et al 2001, Dichgans et al 2002].
