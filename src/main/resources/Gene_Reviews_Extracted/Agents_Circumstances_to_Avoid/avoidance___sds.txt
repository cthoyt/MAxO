Prolonged use of cytokine and hematopoietic growth factors such as G-CSF is cautioned against in view of their potential contribution to leukemic transformation [Rosenberg et al 2006].

Some drugs (e.g., cyclophosphamide and busulfan) used in standard HSCT preparative regimens may not be suitable because of possible cardiac toxicity [Mitsui et al 2004, Cesaro et al 2005, Vibhakar et al 2005, Sauer et al 2007].
