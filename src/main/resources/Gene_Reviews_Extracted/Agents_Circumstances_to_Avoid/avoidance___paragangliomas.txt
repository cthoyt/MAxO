Penetrance of hereditary PGL/PCC syndromes may be increased in those who live in high altitudes or are chronically exposed to hypoxic conditions [Pacheco-Ojeda et al 1988, Astrom et al 2003]. Avoidance of habitation at high altitudes and activities that promote long-term exposure to hypoxia should be considered.

Activities such as cigarette smoking that predispose to chronic lung disease should be discouraged in persons who have a pathogenic variant in SDHA, SDHB,

SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF2, or MAX.
