At-risk family members and asymptomatic individuals with an ATP1A3 pathogenic variant are cautioned to avoid alcohol or excessive exercise.

Infections and fever also are common triggers, and although practical prevention strategies are lacking, unnecessary exposure should be avoided. There is no known reason to avoid vaccinations.

RDP. Triggers associated with the abrupt onset of RDP that should be avoided include (but are not limited to) the following:

Alcohol

Fever

Psychological stress

Excessive exercise (such as running track)

AHC. Triggers associated with inducing paroxysmal episodes in AHC [Sweney et al 2009] include the following:

Psychological stress

Emotional excitement

Environmental stressors: bright light (sunlight or fluorescent lighting), excessive heat or cold, or situations associated with excessive sound, crowds

Water exposure in the form of bathing, swimming, shampooing

Certain foods or odors: chocolate, food dyes, missed meals

Excessive or atypically strenuous exercise (e.g., walking farther than usual, use of a playground swing)

Illness

Irregular sleep, missing a nap, delayed bedtime

CAPOS syndrome. Febrile illness can trigger an episode of ataxic encephalopathy and/or weakness.
