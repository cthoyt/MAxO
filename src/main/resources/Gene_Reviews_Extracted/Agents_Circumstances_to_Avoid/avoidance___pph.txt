Individuals with or at risk for PAH should avoid all the following:

Appetite-suppressant medications (e.g., fenfluramine/phentermine, dexfenfluramine, and amfepramone [diethylpropion]), which have been associated with pulmonary hypertension (PH) [Abenhaim et al 1996, Abramowicz et al 2003]

Cocaine, amphetamines, and related compounds causing vasoconstriction, which have anecdotal association with PH and could be risk factors

Other medications that have anecdotal suggestion of increased risk of PH, including estrogen compounds used as oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy. Anecdotal reports associating pregnancy with onset of PH raise some concern about the risks involved with pregnancy; however, there is no published consensus regarding the best approach to birth control in women with PAH. Because avoidance of exogenous systemic estrogen is desirable, many experts prefer IUD [Austin et al 2009a, Sweeney & Voelkel 2009].

Hypoxia. The hypoxia that accompanies high altitude is associated with pulmonary vasoconstriction and PH in susceptible individuals.
