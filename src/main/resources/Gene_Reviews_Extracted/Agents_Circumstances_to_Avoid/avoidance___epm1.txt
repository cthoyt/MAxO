Phenytoin should be avoided, as it has been found to have aggravating side effects on the associated neurologic symptoms, and may even accelerate cerebellar degeneration [Eldridge et al 1983].

Sodium channel blockers (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin) and GABAergic drugs (tiagabine, vigabatrin) as well as gabapentin and pregabalin should in general be avoided as they may aggravate myoclonus and myoclonic seizures [Medina et al 2005].
