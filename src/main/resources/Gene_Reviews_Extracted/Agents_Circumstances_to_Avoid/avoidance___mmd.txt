Risk for malignant hyperthermia. Depolarizing muscle relaxants (e.g., succinylcholine) and inhalational agents (e.g., halothane, isoflurane, desflurane) can cause malignant hyperthermia and therefore need to be avoided during surgical procedures/childbirth, as RYR1 pathogenic variants are associated with both malignant hyperthermia susceptibility and MmD.
