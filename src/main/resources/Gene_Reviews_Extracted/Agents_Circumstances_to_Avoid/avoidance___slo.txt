Treatment with haloperidol, which has a high affinity for the DHCR7 substrate binding site, may exacerbate the biochemical sterol abnormalities in individuals with SLOS and cause an increase in symptoms. It is likely that other drugs in this class will cause the same change in sterol levels [Kelley & Hennekam 2000]. Other psychotropic drugs shown to elevate 7DHC are trazodone and aripiprazole (AbilifyÂ®) [Hall et al 2013]. Thus, one must weigh the benefit of such medications against the potential negative side effects. As many individuals with SLOS do require psychotropic medications, close monitoring of clinical signs/symptoms and serum concentration of 7-DHC is recommended.

Photosensitivity can be severe and extended periods of sun exposure should be avoided, as severe sunburn can occur with only limited exposure; however, limited sun exposure is possible for some affected individuals as long as protective clothing is worn and a sunscreen with UVA and UVB properties is used.
