In at least one case, a teenage female with SMS was documented to have a serious adverse event taking StratteraÂ® (atomoxetine hydrochloride) with extreme escalation of behaviors and aggression leading to hospitalization. Significant changes in her sleep pattern were also documented. Care should be taken to track sleep parameters and behavior with this medication.
