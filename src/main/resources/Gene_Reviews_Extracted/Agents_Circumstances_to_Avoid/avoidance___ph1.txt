Intravascular volume depletion. The importance of maintaining dilute urine cannot be overemphasized.

Foods high in oxalate (chocolate, rhubarb, and starfruit in particular)

Any significant intake of vitamin C or D, as both may promote stone formation

Loop diuretics to maintain dilute urine, as they can lead to hypercalciuria and increase the production of calcium oxalate stones
