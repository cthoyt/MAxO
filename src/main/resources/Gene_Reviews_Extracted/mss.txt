Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis



To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with Marinesco-Sj√∂gren syndrome (MSS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Physical examination including measurement of height, weight, and head circumference

Evaluation of motor skills with special attention to muscle strength and cerebellar function

Assessment of developmental milestones in infants and intellectual abilities in older children, particularly before school age, to plan appropriate education and rehabilitation

Assessment of speech and feeding

Ophthalmologic examination

Treatment of Manifestations



Treatment of muscular manifestations is symptomatic. Affected individuals are usually managed by pediatric or adult neurologists and physiatrists and/or physical therapists.

Developmental delay and intellectual disability are managed with education programs tailored to the individual's needs.

Cataracts are removed surgically during the first decade of life.

Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (i.e., primary gonadal failure) is treated with hormone replacement therapy at the expected time of puberty.

Prevention of Secondary Complications



Hormone replacement therapy in individuals with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and reduced physical activity can prevent osteoporosis.

Surveillance



The following are appropriate:

Regular follow-up with a child or adult neurologist and physiatrist and/or physical therapist

If the diagnosis is made prior to the development of cataracts, ophthalmologic examination beginning in infancy and at regular intervals

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk



See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
