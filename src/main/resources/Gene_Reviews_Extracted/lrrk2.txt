Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis



To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with LRRK2-related Parkinson disease (PD), neurologic examination should include assessment of the following:

Tremor

Rigidity

Bradykinesia

Gait

Mental status

Medical genetics consultation may also be considered.

Treatment of Manifestations



The treatment of individuals with LRRK2-related PD does not differ from that of idiopathic PD.

The mainstay of treatment is pharmacologic replacement of dopamine, most commonly accomplished with the precursor of dopamine, L-dopa, combined with carbi-dopa.

Dopamine agonists may also be used, as well as inhibitors of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) or monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B).

The motor impairment generally responds well to dopamine therapy (agonists and levodopa).

Other medications include anticholinergics, selegiline, and amantadine [Lang & Lozano 1998a, Lang & Lozano 1998b, Hristova & Koller 2000, Marjama-Lyons & Koller 2001, Olanow & Stocchi 2004].

Neurosurgical procedures such as deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus/globus pallidus interna or pallido-pontine nucleus benefit some individuals in whom dyskinesias or gait disoders are especially problematic. Less commonly, pallidotomy (or, rarely, fetal brain transplant to the caudate nucleus) may also provide benefit [Esselink et al 2004, Schüpbach et al 2007, Gómez-Esteban et al 2008, Munhoz et al 2009].

Individuals with Parkinson disease may benefit from physical, occupational, and speech therapy.

To date, limited effective treatment exists for non-motor findings, which can be extremely disabling.

Prevention of Secondary Complications



The most common complication from L-dopa therapy is dyskinesias, for which deep-brain stimulation has proven helpful [Aasly et al 2005, Gosal et al 2005, Hernandez et al 2005, Goldwurm et al 2006, Ishihara et al 2006, Tomiyama et al 2006].

Other preventions for L-dopa induced dyskinesias include constant drug delivery/stimulation (CDD/CDS) [Jenner 2008], reduction of levodopa doses [Goetz et al 1982] and the use of dopamine receptor agonists [Holloway & Frank 2004, Holloway et al 2004].

Surveillance



Annual neurologic examination should assess gait, tremor, rigidity, cognition, and mood.

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid



Neuroleptic treatment may exacerbate parkinsonism in LRRK2-related PD, as in PD in general.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk



See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Therapies Under Investigation



Lrrk2 protein is a fusion of Rab (Roc), COR and kinase (MAPK) domains, and pathogenic variants are postulated to augment kinase activity [Kachergus et al 2005, West et al 2005, Gloeckner et al 2006, Greggio et al 2006]. Hence, the development of specific kinase inhibitors offers an attractive therapeutic target for neuroprotection in asymptomatic and affected LRRK2 heterozygotes, and for idiopathic PD [Albrecht 2005, Toft et al 2005]. A number of inhibitors are being developed; however, selectivity, specificity, and delivery into the central nervous system remain difficult issues to address [Lee et al 2010b]. Moreover, LRRK2 kinase inhibition may lead to complications that affect the lung and kidney [Herzig et al 2011].
