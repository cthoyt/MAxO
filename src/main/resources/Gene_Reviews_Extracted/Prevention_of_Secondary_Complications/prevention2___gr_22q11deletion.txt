Infants with lymphocyte abnormalities should not be immunized with live vaccines (i.e., oral polio, MMR). Their immune status should be reevaluated in childhood before receiving live vaccines.

Antibody studies to assess results of immunizations are warranted.

Irradiated blood products are recommended until normalization of the immune system can be confirmed.

Serum ionized calcium concentration should be measured pre- and postoperatively to avoid hypocalcemic seizures due to physical stress.

Consider the following:

Assessment of carotid arteries prior to surgical procedures involving the pharynx

Possible effects on speech prior to adenoidectomy

Assessment of cervical spine anomalies prior to hyperextension of the neck during surgical procedures/athletic pursuits, such as tumbling

Pre- and postoperative sleep studies when performing pharyngeal procedures

Assessment of platelet volume and function prior to surgical procedures
