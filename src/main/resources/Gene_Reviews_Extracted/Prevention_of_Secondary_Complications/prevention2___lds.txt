The following are appropriate:

Prevention of secondary cellulitis in areas with lymphedema, particularly as cellulitis may aggravate the degree of edema. Prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., penicillin V 500 mg daily) are recommended for recurrent cellulitis.

Prompt treatment of early cellulitis with appropriate antibiotics (See the British Lymphology Society Consensus Statement for information on appropriate antibiotics.) It may be necessary to give the first few doses intravenously if there is severe systemic upset.

Prevention of foot infections, particularly athlete's foot/infected eczema by treatment with appropriate creams/ointments
