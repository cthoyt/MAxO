To prevent secondary complications:

Preoperative evaluation for thrombocytopenia and cardiac disease

Care during sedation and/or operative procedures in an institution with pediatric anesthesiologists experienced in the management of the small airways of children with CdLS

During anesthesia, attention to the risk of malignant hyperthermia (see Malignant Hyperthermia Susceptibility), which has been reported in a few children with CdLS [Papadimos & Marco 2003]
