Persons with a TP53 pathogenic variant are cautioned to avoid radiation therapy whenever possible in order to limit the risk for secondary radiation-induced malignancies [Evans et al 2006]. However, when radiation is considered medically necessary to improve the chance of survival from a given malignancy, it may be used at the discretion of the treating physician and patient. The concern regarding radiation carcinogenesis is based on older data. There is interest in examining risks associated with more modern techniques, which may be less carcinogenic.

Data on possible sensitivity to the carcinogenic effects of modern chemotherapy regimens are considerably more limited. In rare cases, individuals with germline TP53 pathogenic variants have developed myelodysplastic syndrome and/or acute myeloid leukemia after treatment with radiation or chemotherapy for a prior tumor [Hisada et al 2001, Kuribayashi et al 2005, Talwalkar et al 2010].
