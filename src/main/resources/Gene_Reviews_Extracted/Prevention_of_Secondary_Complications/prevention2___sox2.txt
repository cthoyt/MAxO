Many neonates can have an adequate MRI without general anesthesia using the “feed and wrap” method. In this case, assess morning cortisol levels prior to any subsequent anesthetic if this MRI reveals pituitary hypoplasia. If an anesthetic is required before adequate intracranial imaging is available, an endocrinologic evaluation is indicated.
