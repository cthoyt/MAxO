Veyckemans & Scholtes [2013] have reviewed the anesthetic management of individuals with DM1. Choice of induction agents, airway care, local anesthesia, and neuromuscular blockade were found to minimize complications during surgery in individuals with DM1. Avoid using succinylcholine. Propofol-induced pain can induce myotonia. Sevoflurane has been used uneventfully.

Cardiac pacemakers or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators may prevent life-threatening arrhythmias [Wahbi et al 2012, Facenda-Lorenzo et al 2013].

Gagnon et al [2013] presented evidence that obesity, tobacco smoking, physical inactivity and alcohol/illicit drug consumption are lifestyle risk factors associated with more severe DM1 phenotypes.
