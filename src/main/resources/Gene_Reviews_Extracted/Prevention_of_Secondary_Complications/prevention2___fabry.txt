The prophylaxis for renovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease in persons with Fabry disease is the same as for the general population.

Proteinuria/microalbuminuria should be minimized with ACE inhibitors/ARBs [Tahir et al 2007]; blood pressure control optimized; and cholesterol normalized [Waldek & Feriozzi 2014].

Aspirin and other anti-platelet agents such as clopidogrel may be recommended for the prophylaxis of stroke.

Although evidence as to the effect on long-term outcomes is lacking, use of aspirin and lipid-lowering agents and optimal blood pressure control are recommended in persons with symptoms of cardiac ischemia [Eng et al 2006].

The role of ERT in the long-term prophylaxis of renal, cardiac, and CNS manifestations is unproven; however, on the basis of stabilization of organ function in persons with more advanced disease, some have suggested the initiation of ERT in early disease stages: at first sign of disease manifestations in boys; at age 12-13 years in asymptomatic boys; and at the time of diagnosis in adult males [Eng et al 2006]. Studies indicate that late initiation of therapy when renal or cardiac manifestations are significant is associated with less effect than initiation earlier in the disease course [Germain et al 2015, Ortiz et al 2016].
