The following are recommended:

Avoid over-restriction of protein/amino acids, a common cause of hyperammonemia and poor growth. Gastrostomy tube feedings help avoid malnutrition in affected individuals who self-restrict protein intake and object to the taste of the essential amino acid formulas used for the treatment of urea cycle disorders.

Minimize risk of respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses through hand hygiene.

Give immunizations on the usual schedule, including annual flu vaccine.

Provide multivitamin and vitamin D supplementation.

Use antipyretics appropriately. Note: Ibuprofen is preferred in the home setting over acetaminophen because of the potential liver toxicity of acetaminophen.
