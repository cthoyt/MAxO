In severely affected individuals, treatment with stress steroids in doses customarily used for children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (see 21-Hydroxylase-Deficient Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia) is recommended during periods of illness, stress, or prolonged decrease in oral intake [Bianconi et al 2011].

Anesthetic problems including muscular rigidity and malignant hyperthermia have been reported [Choi & Nowaczyk 2000]. Airway management during anesthesia may be challenging; use of a laryngeal mask airway has been successful [Leal-Pavey 2004, Matveevskii et al 2006].
