Complications following BMT in some individuals include GVHD, failure to make adequate antibodies requiring long-term immunoglobulin replacement, late loss of T cells (presumably due to failure to engraft hematopoietic stem cells), chronic warts, lymphocyte dysregulation, and rarely, malignancy. All individuals have some degree of immunodeficiency, especially during the first six to 12 months following transplantation. PJP, viral and encapsulated organism prophylaxis should be applied per transplantation protocols. IVIG prophylaxis should be considered to maintain serum IgG levels above 400mg/dL. Prompt evaluation of illness should occur until the individual is deemed immunologically competent. Individuals with primary immunodeficiency post transplantation will require bacteriophage testing off all immunosuppressive therapy to determine eligibility for re-vaccination. Only CMV-negative, irradiated blood products should be used. Avoid breast feeding and exposure to young children to prevent CMV transmission to babies with X-SCID.
