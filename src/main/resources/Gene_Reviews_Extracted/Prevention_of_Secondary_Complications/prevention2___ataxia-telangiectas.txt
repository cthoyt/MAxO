Pulmonary and nutritional complications of dysphagia are common. Often, gastrostomy tube feedings are recommended to manage these comorbidities. Children with disorders with predictable progression (like A-T) and impaired swallowing may benefit from early rather than late placement of a feeding tube [Lefton-Greif et al 2000].

Anesthesia carries unique potential risks in persons with A-T because of impaired coordination of swallowing, increased risk of aspiration, reduced respiratory capacity, and propensity to infections [McGrath-Morrow et al 2008]. In a recent review, 24% of patients required supplemental oxygen (maximum duration 24 hours) post anesthesia; mild postoperative hypothermia was also relatively common [Lockman et al 2012].
