Fluid and electrolyte problems, which can be significant and even life-threatening in the neonatal period and in infants with widespread disease, require careful management.

In infants and children with JEB with more severe involvement, failure to thrive may be a problem, requiring additional nutritional support including a feeding gastrostomy when necessary to assure adequate caloric intake [Haynes 2006].

In children who survive the newborn period, nutritional deficiencies must also be addressed when they are identified:

Calcium and vitamin D replacement for osteopenia and osteoporosis

Zinc supplementation for wound healing [Mellerio et al 2007]

Treatment of iron-deficiency anemia (a chronic problem) with oral or intravenous iron infusions and red blood cell transfusions

Wound infections should be treated with the appropriate antiseptic or antimicrobial medication.
