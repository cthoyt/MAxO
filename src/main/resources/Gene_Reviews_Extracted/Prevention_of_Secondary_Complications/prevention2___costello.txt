Cardiac. Certain congenital heart defects (notably valvar pulmonic stenosis) require antibiotic prophylaxis for subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE), available by prescription from the cardiologist or other physician caregiver. Because aortic dilation has not been studied long term, is infrequent, is typically mild-moderate in severity, and has not been associated with dissection to date, there are no data to recommend treatment; care should be individualized.

Sedation. Individuals with Costello syndrome may require relatively high doses of medication for sedation. No standardized information is available, but review of an individual's medical records documenting previously given dosages may provide guidance.

Anesthesia may pose a risk to individuals with some forms of unrecognized hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or those who have a predisposition to some types of atrial tachycardia.
