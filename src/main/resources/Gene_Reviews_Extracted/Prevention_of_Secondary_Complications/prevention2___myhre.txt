Limiting tissue trauma appears to be the single most important preventive measure: The literature suggests increased risk of proliferative fibrosis following otherwise uncomplicated endotracheal intubation and surgical procedures. When possible, alternative noninvasive approaches should be pursued during diagnosis and management [Oldenburg et al 2015, Starr et al 2015].

Extreme care with intubation and use of an endotracheal tube without a cuff (or careful monitoring of pressures with a cuff) may help prevent airway stenosis [Oldenburg et al 2015].

Minimize abdominal and pelvic procedures as extensive adhesions may develop postoperatively [Lindor et al 2012].

Hysterectomy should be an option of last resort for treatment of menorrhagia as post-surgical fibrosis is highly likely.
