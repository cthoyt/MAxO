The onset and the clinical course of the secondary complications, such as lung and renal involvement, seem to be poorly influenced by early treatment.

Efforts to minimize the risk of respiratory infections should be promoted.

An individual with LPI without previous history of chickenpox or varicella zoster should be vaccinated or, if exposed to varicella, treated as an immune-compromised person.

Some individuals with LPI may respond poorly to polysaccharide-containing vaccines. Therefore, revaccination may be required if specific antibody titers are non-protective.
