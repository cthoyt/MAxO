Patients with GACI are predisposed to periarticular calcifications, and at least two individuals with cervical spine fusion have been reported [Gopalakrishnan et al 2008, Nitschke et al 2012]. Thus, it seems prudent to perform a lateral cervical spine x-ray when elective endotracheal intubation is necessary, for example, prior to surgery. In persons with cervical spine fusion, fiberoptic intubation is recommended and, if hypertension is also present, a nasal route may be preferred over an oral route since it produces a less prominent pressor response [Gopalakrishnan et al 2008].
