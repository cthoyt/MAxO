AEDs are associated with possible adverse reactions (e.g., sedation, gastrointestinal symptoms, changes in appetite [increase or decrease], weight gain or loss, and rash) which vary according to the specific medication. Patients on AEDs should be monitored closely for adverse reactions and, if they develop, a change to an alternate AED should be considered.

Corticosteroids are associated with a wide variety of possible adverse reactions, including weight gain with cushingoid appearance, skin thinning and purpura, alopecia, acne, posterior subscapular cataract, glaucoma, exophthalmos, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, gastrointestinal upset, pancreatitis, hypokalemia, osteoporosis, avascular necrosis, myopathy, behavioral/psychiatric disturbance, diabetes mellitus, adrenal insufficiency, and increased infection risk. If complications of corticosteroid therapy become of concern, gradual tapering and alternate therapy should be considered.
