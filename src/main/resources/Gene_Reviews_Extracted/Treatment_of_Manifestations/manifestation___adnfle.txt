In about 70% of individuals with ADNFLE, carbamazepine is associated with remission of seizures, often with relatively low doses. However, individuals with ADNFLE associated with the CHRNA4 pathogenic variant p.Ser284Leu respond only partially to carbamazepine and are more responsive to zonisamide [Provini et al 1999, Ito et al 2000, Combi et al 2004].

Exposure to quinidine significantly reduces gain of function for KCNT1 pathogenic variants implicated in ADNFLE and EIMFS [Milligan et al 2014]. Clinical treatment with quinidine was reported in a child with EIMFS [Bearden et al 2014], and correlated with a marked reduction in seizure frequency. In the future, it may be also possible to treat KCNT1-related ADNFLE with quinidine.

Resistance to AEDs occurs in about 30% of affected individuals. Intrafamilial variation in pharmaco-responsiveness occurs; therefore, all appropriate AEDs should be tried.

Vagal nerve stimulation may be considered for individuals with resistance to AEDs [Carre√±o et al 2010].
