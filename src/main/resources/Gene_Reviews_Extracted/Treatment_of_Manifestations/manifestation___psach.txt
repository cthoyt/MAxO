Joint pain may be controlled with analgesics, but no systematic studies have evaluated the effectiveness of various forms of pain control in pseudoachondroplasia.

Osteotomy to treat the lower limb malalignment is common during childhood. The need for subsequent revision is also common, which most likely reflects the severe joint instability that can be present in some affected individuals [Hunter 1999, Li et al 2007].
