The following treatment considerations apply to individuals with MSUD who have pathogenic variants in the E1a, E1b, or E2 subunits of BCKAD complex. Note: Treatment recommendations do not apply to those with disease caused by pathogenic variants in the common E3 subunit.

Home therapy. Dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) reagent allows home detection of high urine BCKAs during metabolic decompensation. With timely detection of mild or moderate illness, many individuals can be managed safely at home by experienced providers using dietary leucine restriction, high-calorie BCAA-free "sick-day" formulas, and frequent outpatient monitoring. Vomiting is the major reason that the sick neonate or child fails home therapy.

Acute decompensation. Dietary indiscretion causes plasma BCAAs to increase but only rarely results in acute decompensation and encephalopathy. In contrast, infections and injuries trigger a large endogenous mobilization of muscle protein and can precipitate metabolic crisis and hospitalization. Leading causes of hospitalization among one cohort of children with MSUD (N=15) are summarized in Table 4 [Strauss et al 2010].

Reasons for 28 Hospitalizations in 15 Infants with MSUD

Strauss et al [2010]

Correction of metabolic decompensation is predicated on establishing net protein accretion. This is achieved by treating the precipitating stress (e.g., infection, dehydration, pain, fever) while simultaneously delivering sufficient calories, insulin, free amino acids, isoleucine, and valine to stimulate net protein synthesis in muscle and liver. Rapid nutritional correction of leucine intoxication in older children and adults is more challenging than in young rapidly growing infants (see, e.g., Figure 2 and Figure 9) but is, nonetheless, possible with higher weight-adjusted calorie intake (see Methods of achieving these goals) [Strauss, Puffenberger, Morton, unpublished observation].

Simultaneous in-hospital management of metabolic intoxication and brain edema is complex and should be guided by an experienced metabolic specialist. Metabolic physicians may benefit from the expertise of an intensivist when administering medications such as insulin, hypertonic saline, and mannitol. Referral centers that admit individuals with MSUD who are in crisis should be able to provide parenteral BCAA-free amino acid and 1% isoleucine and valine solutions in the hospital pharmacy, as well as 24-hour monitoring of plasma amino acid concentrations.

The primary goals of in-hospital therapy

Decrease plasma leucine concentration at greater than 750 µmol/L per 24 hrs.

Provide isoleucine and valine supplementation sufficient to maintain plasma concentrations of 400-600 µmol/L during the acute phase of illness.

Maintain serum sodium concentration of 138-145 mEq/L with minimal fluctuation.

Avoid osmolarity changes of greater than 5 mosm/L per day or 0.25 mosm/L per hour.

Maintain urine output of 2-4 mL/kg/hr and urine osmolarity of 300-400 mosm/L.

Minimize exposure to hypotonic fluid sources.

Anticipate and prevent iatrogenic electrolyte abnormalities associated with intravenous glucose and insulin therapy; the most commonly encountered are hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia.

Methods of achieving these goals

Identify and treat precipitating conditions (e.g., infection, inflammation, and fever).

Administer antiemetics (e.g., odansetron 0.15 mg/kg/dose) to control nausea and vomiting.

Provide at least 1.25 times the weight or body surface area-adjusted estimated energy requirement (EER), with 40%-50% of calories as lipid. EER, in kcal/m2/day, is approximately 1700 for neonates, 1500 for young children, and 1200 for adults. In older children and adults with catabolic illness, calorie intakes as high as three times the EER (i.e., 6000 calories per day) are often necessary to establish net protein anabolism.Note: Hypercaloric feeding typically requires a total (enteral + parenteral) glucose delivery rate of ≥10 mg/kg/min and can result in hyperglycemia. Regular insulin is typically infused at a continuous rate of 0.05-0.10 units/kg/hour and titrated to maintain euglycemia. Patients with severe illness may require higher rates of insulin infusion to counteract the glycemic effects of circulating glucagon, cortisol, and epinephrine [Strauss, Puffenberger, Morton, unpublished observation].

Provide BCAA-free essential and non-essential amino acids: 2.0-3.5 g/kg/day.

Provide specific amino acid supplements during metabolic crisis:

Isoleucine and valine. 20-120 mg/kg/day each; intake is adjusted as necessary at 12- to 24-hour intervals to achieve the goals for isoleucine and valine plasma concentrations (400-600 µmol/L) and to optimize the rate of plasma leucine correction.

Glutamine and alanine. Total intake: 150-400 mg/kg/day each, depending on age and clinical circumstances (Table 5). Newer MSUD medical foods are fortified with glutamine and alanine [Strauss et al 2010]; use of such products precludes the need to supply glutamine and alanine separately.

Tyrosine. During acute metabolic crisis, newborns, infants, and children with MSUD can develop acute focal or generalized dystonic posturing attributed to an increased plasma leucine:tyrosine concentration ratio, restricted brain tyrosine uptake, and reduced cerebral dopamine synthesis [Morton et al 2002, Zinnanti et al 2009]. Tyrosine dissolves poorly in aqueous solution, but when supplied enterally (100-400 mg/kg/day) can rapidly reverse dystonia associated with metabolic crisis [Strauss et al 2010; Strauss & Morton, unpublished observation].

Total nutritional goals can be met by combined enteral and parenteral administration. In ill neonates or children otherwise able to tolerate enteral formula, regular feeding (30-60 mL each hour) or continuous nasogastric delivery of a one kcal/mL BCAA-free MSUD formula supplemented with isoleucine and valine is an effective way to manage metabolic crises [Nyhan et al 1998, Morton et al 2002].

Control of brain edema. A decrease in blood osmolarity of more than 8 mosm/L per day can precipitate fatal brain herniation in an ill infant or child with MSUD (Figure 4). Close monitoring (preferably in an intensive care unit) is warranted.

Neurologic assessments to be performed on a frequent basis to monitor for brain swelling include the following:

Measure head circumference and fontanel size in neonates.

Watch for signs of increased intracranial pressure including the following:

Papilledema

Disorientation, combativeness

Depressed level of consciousness

Refractory vomiting

Extremity hyperreflexia

Bradycardic hypertension

Watch for signs of impending brain herniation including the following:

Hyperactive gag

Pupillary asymmetry

Ophthalmoplegia

Decorticate posturing

Methods to minimize the possibility of brain swelling:

In appropriate clinical settings, the authors recommend use of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line in encephalopathic patients with MSUD. This allows sufficient nutritional support to be delivered without an excessive fluid volume and reduces the risk for cerebral edema.

Elevate the individual's head.

Assess total body sodium, potassium, and water balance at 12-hour intervals. The following clinical formula is useful for managing the serum sodium concentration [Rose & Post 1994]:

Serum Na concentration equals ~([total body Na + total body K]/ total body water).

Assume total body water equals ~70% body weight, 2/3 of which is intracellular and has sodium and potassium concentrations of 14 mEq/L and 140 mEq/L, respectively [Guyton & Hall 1996].

Minimize osmotic variation of the extracellular fluid in hospitalized patients by assessing weight trend, urine output, and serum and urine electrolytes every 12 hours and adjusting electrolyte and water intake accordingly [Strauss, Puffenberger, Morton, unpublished observation].

Note: Give furosemide (0.5-1.0 mg/kg/dose) as needed every six to 12 hours to oppose the urinary concentrating action of vasopressin and maintain urine osmolarity at a ceiling value of 300-400 mosm/L. This allows for brisk output of isotonic urine to compensate for the large infused volume associated with hypercaloric feeding.

Methods to manage brain swelling:

For weight gain, hyponatremia, or deepening encephalopathy, the authors administer [Strauss, Puffenberger, Morton, unpublished observation]:

Furosemide: 0.5-1.0 mg/kg, followed by

Mannitol: 0.5-1.0 g/kg over 60 minutes, followed by

Hypertonic (3%-5%) saline: 2.5 mEq/kg over 60 minutes

Neuroimaging. During episodes of acute encephalopathy, individuals with MSUD are typically too unstable for magnetic resonance imaging. Cranial CT scan is used to look for major indices of cerebral edema, such as decreased volume of cerebral ventricles and basal fluid spaces, or reduced gray-white discrimination (Figure 4).

If there is clinical evidence of evolving brain herniation, elevate the individual's head, hyperventilate by face mask or endotracheal tube, give mannitol 1-2 g/kg and hypertonic saline 3 mEq/kg, and transfer the individual emergently to a pediatric or neurologic intensive care unit.

Hemodialysis/hemofiltration. Nutritional therapy alone can effectively reduce even extremely elevated plasma concentrations of leucine in persons with MSUD of any age and under a wide variety of clinical circumstances [Morton et al 2002, Strauss & Morton 2003]. However, numerous publications have shown that renal replacement methods can achieve rapid corrections of BCAAs and BCKAs during the acute phase of MSUD crisis [Jouvet et al 1997, Schaefer et al 1999, Yoshino et al 1999, Jouvet et al 2001, Puliyanda et al 2002].

As methods of invasive leucine removal, peritoneal dialysis and venovenous hemofiltration are less effective and more dangerous than short courses of continuous hemodialysis [Schaefer et al 1999]. When hemodialysis is used to treat MSUD it must be coupled with effective nutritional management to constrain the catabolic response and prevent recurrent clinical intoxication. A combined approach to therapy, using hemodialysis with simultaneous anabolic nutritional therapy, was shown to be highly effective in one neonate with classic MSUD [Puliyanda et al 2002]. Dialysis without simultaneous management of the underlying disturbance of protein turnover is analogous to treating diabetic ketoacidosis with invasive removal of glucose and ketones rather than insulin infusion. In both conditions, effective treatment depends not only on lowering concentrations of pathologic metabolites, but also on controlling the underlying metabolic derangement.

Other potential complications in hospitalized persons with MSUD:

Acute pancreatitis. If clinical signs of pancreatitis (epigastric or mid-back pain, anorexia, vomiting) develop two to three days into the treatment of a metabolic decompensation, stop all enteral feeding and measure serum concentrations of lipase and amylase [Kahler et al 1994]. Treatment is supportive; persons with MSUD with pancreatitis need to be managed with special parenteral nutrition solutions until the condition abates.

Infection. Monitor for and promptly treat hospital-acquired infections. Superficial and invasive Candida infections are common. Persons with MSUD are vulnerable to bacterial or fungal infection from central venous catheters.
