Ideally, the team evaluating and treating a deaf individual should include an otolaryngologist with expertise in the management of early childhood otologic disorders, an audiologist experienced in the assessment of hearing loss in children, a clinical geneticist, and a pediatrician. The expertise of an educator of the Deaf, a neurologist, and a pediatric ophthalmologist may also be required.

Enrollment in appropriate early intervention programs and educational programs for the hearing-impaired

An important part of the evaluation is determining the appropriate habilitation option. Possibilities include hearing aids, vibrotactile devices, brain stem implants, and cochlear implantation:

Consideration of vibrotactile hearing devices or brain stem implants for individuals with complete labyrinth aplasia [Riazuddin et al 2011]

Evaluation for cochlear implantation in those individuals with a cochleovestibular nerve and a cochlear remnant. Cochlear implantation can be considered in children over age 12 months with severe-to-profound hearing loss.

Routine ophthalmologic management of strabismus, if present
