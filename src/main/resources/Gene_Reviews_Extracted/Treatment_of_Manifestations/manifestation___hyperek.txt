Clonazepam appears to be the most effective treatment for HPX [Tijssen et al 1997, Tsai et al 2004]. In adults the initial dose is 0.5 mg twice a day. The dose can be increased up to 2.0 mg three times a day. The stiffness in the neonatal period and stiffness related to startle diminish with the treatment.

Other drugs, mostly described in case reports, have shown variable results; they include carbamazepine, phenytoin, diazepam, valproate, 5-hydroxytryptophan, piracetam, and phenobarbital. For an overview see Bakker et al [2006].

Physical and cognitive therapy to reduce the fear of falling and thereby improve walking can be considered; no randomized trials have assessed the effectiveness of such treatment.

Attacks of tonic neonatal cyanosis can be stopped by the Vigevano maneuver, consisting of forced flexion of the head and legs towards the trunk [Vigevano et al 1989].
