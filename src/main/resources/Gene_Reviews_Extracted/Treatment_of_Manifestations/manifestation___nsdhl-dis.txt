CHILD syndrome

Oral aromatic retinoids (etretinate) to ameliorate cutaneous symptoms; however, this drug is often poorly tolerated [Happle et al 1980] and does not prove effective in every case [Liu et al 2015].

Topical treatments including lactic acid 12% creams or lotions for itching and urea creams for dry skin. Oral and topical ketoconazole were found to result in a 90% reduction of cutaneous lesions after ten days of therapy [Liu et al 2015].

Topical statins. The use of lovastatin topically led to complete healing of the inflammatory CHILD nevus in a few single cases, whereas cholesterol application alone had no satisfactory effect [Merino De Paz et al 2011, Paller et al 2011]. Alexopoulos & Kakourou [2015] recently reported the combined topical use of simvastatin and cholesterol and showed a correction in the cutaneous phenotype of one patient.

Dermatologic surgery. An inflammatory nevus was removed from an affected boy by dermabrasion; however, it recurred within eight months [Happle et al 1996]. KÃ¶nig et al [2010] reported successful treatment of an inflammatory nevus by grafting skin obtained from a contralateral unaffected region.

Note: No one therapy described to date appears to ameliorate the cutaneous findings for every reported individual with CHILD syndrome. Trying different methods until the clinician finds a successful therapy seems to be typical for most affected individuals.

Orthopedic abnormalities. Treatment of orthopedic abnormalities such as scoliosis and joint contractures with braces and/or corrective surgery
