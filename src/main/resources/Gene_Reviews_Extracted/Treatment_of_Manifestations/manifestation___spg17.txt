Treatment remains symptomatic and affected individuals are often evaluated and managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes neurologists, physiatrists, orthopedic surgeons, medical geneticists, and physical and occupational therapists.

Physiotherapy is appropriate.

Orthopedic treatment includes orthopedic shoes and calipers (polypropylene devices that fit between the thighs and hold the legs and hips in a balanced position for standing, used in conjunction with crutches or a walker) to stabilize gait. Foot deformities are corrected by surgical treatment.
