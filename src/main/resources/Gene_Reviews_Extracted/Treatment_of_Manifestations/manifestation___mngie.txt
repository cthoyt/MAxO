Cooperation among multiple specialties including neurology, clinical genetics, nutrition, gastroenterology, pain management, psychiatry, and physical/occupational therapy helps with timely detection and treatment of the various aspects of multi-organ dysfunction. Once symptoms appear, treatment is primarily supportive.

Management of GI dysfunction can include the following:

Early attention to swallowing difficulties and airway protection, especially in the most severely affected individuals

Trial of dromperidone for nausea and vomiting

Nutritional support including (when necessary) bolus feedings, gastrostomy tube placement, and total parenteral nutrition

Antibiotic therapy for intestinal bacterial overgrowth, a complication of dysmotility

Celiac plexus block with bupivicaine. This has been successful in reducing pain by interrupting visceral afferent pain sensation and increasing GI motility by inhibiting sympathetic efferent activity to the upper abdominal viscera and much of the small bowel [Teitelbaum et al 2002]. Splanchnic nerve block has been used successfully to reduce abdominal pain [Celebi et al 2006].

Complex medication regimens that include amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and gabapentin for relief of neuropathic symptoms, which are difficult to treat

Specialized schooling arrangements, typically necessary for children and young adults

Physical therapy and occupational therapy to help preserve mobility. Activity as tolerated should be encouraged.
