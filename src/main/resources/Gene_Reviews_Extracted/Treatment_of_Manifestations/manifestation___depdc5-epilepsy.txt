The response to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is variable. While some individuals respond well to first-line AEDs, others are more refractory to treatment. In four families with ADNFLE with a heterozygous DEPDC5 pathogenic variant, seven of nine individuals were drug resistant [Picard et al 2014], whereas in previous studies of individuals with ADNFLE, only one third of individuals were drug resistant.

There is currently no evidence that seizures respond better to one particular AED.

Attention should be paid to possible (long-term) side effects of AEDs. As in all patients with epilepsy, the goal should be to use as few AEDs as possible, in the lowest efficacious dose.

In patients with focal cortical dysplasia, the possibility of epilepsy surgery should be explored early in the disease course. In one study, four of five unrelated individuals who underwent epilepsy surgery with resection of the focal cortical dysplasia had a favorable postoperative outcome [Baulac et al 2015]. Several of these individuals were part of a larger family in which most family members had a history of focal epilepsy without FCD.
