Recommended treatment:

Second branchial arch anomalies. Excise branchial cleft cysts/fistulae.

Otologic anomalies

Fit with appropriate aural habilitation as indicated.

Enroll in an appropriate educational program for the hearing impaired.

Consider canaloplasty to correct an atretic canal; however, in individuals with BOR/BOS, associated middle ear anomalies (e.g., a facial nerve overriding the oval window) can preclude a successful result. Evaluate the status of the middle ear preoperatively by obtaining thin-cut CT images of the temporal bones in both the axial and coronal planes.

Renal anomalies

Treat urologic and renal abnormalities in the standard manner.

If renal anomalies (e.g., vesicoureteral reflux) are present, medical and surgical treatment may prevent progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

If ESRD develops, consider renal transplantation.
