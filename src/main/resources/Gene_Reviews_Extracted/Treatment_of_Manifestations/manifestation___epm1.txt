Symptomatic pharmacologic and rehabilitative management are the mainstay of patient care [Kälviäinen et al 2008]:

Valproic acid is the first drug of choice. It diminishes myoclonus and the frequency of generalized seizures.

Clonazepam, the only drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of myoclonic seizures, is used as add-on therapy [Shahwan et al 2005].

High-dose piracetam has been formally studied and has been found useful in the treatment of myoclonus [Koskiniemi et al 1998].

Levetiracetam has been evaluated in several series and seems to be effective for both myoclonus and generalized seizures.

Topiramate and zonisamide may also be used as add-on therapies.
