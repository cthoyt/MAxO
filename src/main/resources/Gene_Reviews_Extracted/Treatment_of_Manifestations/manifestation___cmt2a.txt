Special shoes, including those with good ankle support

Ankle/foot orthoses to correct foot drop and aid walking [Carter et al 1995]

Orthopedic surgery to correct severe pes cavus deformity [Holmes & Hansen 1993, Guyton & Mann 2000]

Forearm crutches or canes for gait stability

Wheelchairs for mobility because of gait instability

Exercise within the individual's capability

Treatment of musculoskeletal pain with acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents [Carter et al 1998]

Treatment of neuropathic pain with tricyclic antidepressants or drugs such as carbamazepine or gabapentin

Career and employment counseling because of persistent weakness of hands and/or feet
