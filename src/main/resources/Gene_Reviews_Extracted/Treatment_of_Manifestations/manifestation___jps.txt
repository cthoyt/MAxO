JPS. The most effective management is routine colonoscopy with endoscopic polypectomy. Early endoscopic polypectomy may reduce morbidity by reducing the risk for cancer, bleeding, or intestinal obstruction.

In some individuals, removal of all or part of the colon or stomach may be necessary to alleviate symptoms and/or reduce cancer risk when a large number of polyps are present. The preferred procedure is debated: some experts prefer subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis, whereas others prefer proctocolectomy with an ileoanal pouch. The number of colonic or rectal polyps does not appear to correlate with the need for proctectomy [Oncel et al 2005].

JPS/HHT. Treat manifestations of HHT as needed; see Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia.
