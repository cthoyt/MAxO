Individuals with CMT1 are often evaluated and managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes neurologists, physiatrists, orthopedic surgeons, and physical and occupational therapists [Carter 1997, Grandis & Shy 2005].

Treatment is symptomatic and may include the following:

Special shoes, including those with good ankle support; affected individuals often require ankle/foot orthoses (AFOs) to correct foot drop and aid walking [Ramdharry et al 2012a].

Orthopedic surgery to correct severe pes cavus deformity [Guyton & Mann 2000, Ward et al 2008, Boffeli & Tabatt 2015]

Forearm crutches or canes for gait stability for some individuals; fewer than 5% of individuals need wheelchairs.

Exercise within the individual's capability; many remain physically active. Exercise is not detrimental to persons with CMT [Piscosquito et al 2014].

Serial night casting to help increase ankle flexibility [Rose et al 2010]

Accurate identification, as far as possible, of the cause of pain:

Musculoskeletal pain may respond to acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents [Carter et al 1998].

Neuropathic pain may respond to tricyclic antidepressants or drugs such as carbamazepine or gabapentin.

Career and employment counseling to address persistent weakness of hands and/or feet

Interventions designed to improve leg cramps, tremor, agility, endurance, and ankle flexibility, thereby improving quality of life; see Burns et al [2010] study of children with CMT1A.
