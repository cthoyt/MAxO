Fragile X syndrome. No specific treatment is available. Supportive therapy for children and adults with fragile X syndrome currently consists of the following [Hagerman et al 2009, Utari et al 2010]:

Recognition of the need for special education and anticipatory management such as the avoidance of excessive stimulation whenever possible may ameliorate some of the behavioral difficulties.

Early educational intervention, special education, and vocational training should be aimed specifically at the known impediments to learning. Parents and teachers of children with fragile X syndrome have recognized the need for individual attention, small class size, and the avoidance of sudden change. More specific guidelines are available through education resources (see Resources).

Pharmacologic management of behavioral issues that significantly affect social interaction is appropriate. No particular pharmacologic treatment has been shown to be uniquely beneficial; therapy must be individualized and closely monitored. A closely monitored and integrated program of behavioral management and pharmacologic treatment with an experienced developmental team may prove to be beneficial.

Routine medical management of strabismus, otitis media, gastroesophageal reflux, seizures, mitral valve prolapse, and hypertension is appropriate.

FXTAS. No specific treatment is available. Supportive care for problems with gait and/or cognitive deficits may require assistance with activities of daily living.

POI. No specific treatment is available. Gynecologic or reproductive endocrinologic evaluation can provide appropriate treatment and counseling for reproductive options.
