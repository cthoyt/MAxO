A multidisciplinary approach to manage the features and specific issues identified is recommended. Specialists in the following fields are often involved: clinical genetics, neurology, child development, behavioral therapy, nutrition/feeding, speech and language therapy, and occupational and physical therapy.

Neurologic

Infants benefit from enrollment in an early-intervention program.

School-age children benefit from an individualized educational program.

Speech therapy with early introduction of nonverbal methods of communication (e.g., sign language and computer-assisted technologies) is appropriate given the high risk for poor or absent speech.

Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) such as valproate, clonazepam, zonisamide and clobazam appear to be effective in reducing the incidence of seizures [Jaillard et al 2009, van Bon et al 2010, Williams et al 2010, Chung et al 2011, Talkowski et al 2011, Motobayashi et al 2012, Noh & Graham 2012, Bonnet et al 2013, Hodge et al 2014]. No information is available on response to specific AEDs.

Behavior

Routine management of behavioral issues associated with severe intellectual disability and/or autism spectrum disorder is indicated.

Management of sleep disturbance through a combined approach of targeted sleep hygiene (to develop firm daily schedules) and use of daily medications such as melatonin, clonidine, and trazadone may be considered [Mullegama et al 2015b].

Routine management is necessary for constipation (which can affect behavior).
