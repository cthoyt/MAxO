No specific treatment reverses the manifestations of CMT4J.

Affected individuals are often managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes a neurologist, physiatrist, orthopedic surgeon, and physical and occupational therapists [Carter et al 1995, Pareyson & Marchesi 2009, Reilly & Shy 2009].

Treatment is symptomatic and may include the following:

Special shoes, including those with good ankle support

Ankle/foot orthoses to correct foot drop and aid walking [Carter et al 1995]

Orthopedic surgery to correct severe pes cavus deformity [Guyton & Mann 2000, Ward et al 2008]

Forearm crutches or canes for gait stability; severely affected individuals need wheelchairs.

Exercise within the individual's capability to remain physically active

BIPAP for those with respiratory muscle weakness
