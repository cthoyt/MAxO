No specific treatment for PXE exists.

Management of PXE requires coordinated input from a multidisciplinary team of specialists including a dermatologist, primary care physician, ophthalmologist, cardiologist, vascular surgeon, plastic surgeon, genetics professional, and nutritionist. Support groups can benefit affected individuals and their families by providing accurate information and education and reducing isolation.

Current treatment for macular degeneration, especially the intraocular injection of anti-angiogenic drugs, also appears to be effective in PXE [Finger et al 2011]. A retinal specialist should be consulted immediately when the individual experiences any distortion in vision.

Surgical or radiologic intervention may be indicated for gastrointestinal bleeding, severe peripheral vascular disease (if correctable), and the improvement of changes of the skin of the face, neck, axilla, and groin that are of cosmetic concern. Although wound healing seems to be uncomplicated in PXE, cosmetic acceptability of surgery involving the skin is less predictable, although generally good [Viljoen et al 1990].
