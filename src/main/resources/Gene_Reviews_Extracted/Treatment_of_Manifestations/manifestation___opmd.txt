Ptosis

Surgery is recommended when ptosis interferes with vision or appears to cause cervical pain secondary to constant dorsiflexion of the neck. The two types of blepharoplasty used to correct the ptosis are resection of the levator palpebrae aponeurosis and frontal suspension of the eyelids [Codere 1993].

Resection of the aponeurosis is easily done, but usually needs to be repeated once or twice [Rodrigue & Molgat 1997].

Frontal suspension of the eyelids uses a thread of muscle fascia as a sling; the fascia is inserted through the tarsal plate of the upper eyelid and the ends are attached in the frontalis muscle, which is relatively preserved in OPMD [Codere 1993]. The major advantage of frontal suspension of the eyelids is that it is permanent; however, the procedure requires general anesthesia.

Dysphagia

Food should be cut into small pieces.

Although no controlled trials have been performed [Hill et al 2004], surgical intervention for dysphagia should be considered when symptomatic dysphagia is accompanied by marked weight loss, near-fatal choking, and/or recurrent pneumonia [Duranceau et al 1983, St Guily et al 1995, Périé et al 1997, Coiffier et al 2006].

Cricopharyngeal myotomy, consisting of extramucosal section of the cricopharyngeal muscle that improves swallowing through the upper esophageal sphincter [Montgomery & Lynch 1971, Duranceau et al 1980, St Guily et al 1994, St Guily et al 1995, Duranceau 1997], is easily performed and immediately improves symptoms in most cases [Duranceau et al 1983]; however, in a very high proportion of patients progressive dysphagia recurs within years [Coiffier et al 2006].
