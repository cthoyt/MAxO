Treatment is symptomatic:

Deafness. Hearing aids, speech therapy, and sign language to support social adaptation and prevent educational problems in children with IOSCA. Computers may be a valuable aid in support of communication and learning.

Sensory axonal neuropathy. Physiotherapy and orthoses to prevent foot and spine deformity; supportive shoes, splints, and braces; orthopedic surgery for foot deformities (pes cavus) and spine deformities (scoliosis); foot care to treat calluses and ulcerations

Ataxia. A walker, wheelchair, physiotherapy, occupational therapy

Epilepsy. Conventional antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (phenytoin and phenobarbital) are ineffective in most patients [LÃ¶nnqvist et al 2009].

Some patients have benefited from lamotrigine or levetiracetam.

Benzodiazepines, especially midazolam-infusion, when started early in status epilepticus, were occasionally effective.

Oxcarbazepine has some effect, but hyponatremia is a troublesome side effect.

Psychiatric symptoms. Antipsychotics (neurolepts, risperidone, olanzpine) to prevent psychotic behavior and antidepressants (SSRIs) for severe depression
