No specific therapy is currently available for ALSP.

Management is supportive and includes: attention to general care, nutritional requirements, antiepileptic drugs for seizures, and antibiotic treatment for general and recurrent infections such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.

Other:

L-dopa or other dopaminergic therapies have not been beneficial in individuals with ALSP or in those with an atypical parkinsonian phenotype, but may be worth trying.

Antidepressant medications may be prescribed for depression but reports to date have demonstrated no long-term benefit.

Antipsychotics are in general not recommended due to extrapyramidal side effects, but may be used in aggressive individuals.

Anti-seizure medications should be initiated in any individuals with seizures and are reported to be beneficial.
