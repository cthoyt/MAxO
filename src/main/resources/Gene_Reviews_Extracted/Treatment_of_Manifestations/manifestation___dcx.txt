Epileptic seizures require antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Individual treatment strategies should be developed depending on the type and frequency of seizures, EEG results, and responsiveness.

In addition, appropriate management can prolong survival and improve quality of life for individuals with classic lissencephaly.

Feeding problems in newborns may require special strategies including placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube to deal with weak or uncoordinated sucking.

Physical therapy helps to maintain and promote mobility and prevent contractures. Special adaptive chairs or positioners may be required.

Occupational therapy may help improve fine motor skills and oral motor control.

A full range of educational training and enrichment programs should be available.
