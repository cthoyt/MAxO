The management of SSADH deficiency is most often symptomatic, directed at the treatment of seizures and neurobehavioral disturbances.

Seizures. Antiseizure medications employed for the treatment of SSADH deficiency tend to be broad spectrum, although valproate is avoided when possible because of inhibition of potential residual enzymatic activity [Shinka et al 2003]. Vigabatrin, an irreversible inhibitor of GABA-transaminase, inhibits the formation of succinic semialdehyde [Matern et al 1996]. However, vigabatrin has shown inconsistent results [Howells et al 1992, Gropman 2003], suggesting that it is not effective at inhibiting peripheral GABA-transaminase, leading to a peripheral supply of 4-hydroxybutyric acid to the brain and thus decreasing its own efficacy. Brain MRI signal changes, particularly prominent in the thalamus and basal ganglia, have been seen in infants treated with relatively high doses of vigabatrin [Pearl et al 2009c].

However, reports of uncontrolled, nonblinded trials of vigabatrin in two affected children described a decrease in plasma GHB concentrations and clinical improvement (specifically in verbal communication) in one child age eight years [Casarano et al 2012] and slow clinical improvement (although not unexpected based on natural history) in a child age 2.5 years [Escalera et al 2010].

Neurobehavioral symptoms. Methylphenidate, thioridazine, risperidal, fluoxetine, and benzodiazepines have been used for the treatment of increased anxiety, aggressiveness, and inattention [Gibson et al 2003].

Beneficial non-pharmacologic treatments include physical therapy directed at developing strength, endurance, and balance; occupational therapy for improvement of fine motor skills, feeding, and sensory integration; and speech therapy [Gropman 2003].
