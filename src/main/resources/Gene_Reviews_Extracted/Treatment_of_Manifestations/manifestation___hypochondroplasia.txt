Management of short stature is influenced by parental expectations and concerns. Final adult height in hypochondroplasia is considerably greater than that achieved in achondroplasia and therefore, functional limitations in society (e.g., operating an elevator, driving a car, using an automatic teller machine) are generally less severe or not an issue. One reasonable approach is to address the parents' expectations and prejudices regarding the height of their child rather than attempting to treat the child.

Developmental intervention and special educational input are appropriate, as indicated by deficiencies.

The usual neurosurgical approach to spinal stenosis is laminectomy. Thomeer & van Dijk [2002] determined that about 70% of symptomatic individuals with achondroplasia experienced total relief of symptoms following decompression without laminectomy. The L2-3 level most commonly required decompression.

Making the family aware of support groups, such as the Little People of America Inc. (LPA), can result in assistance with adaptation of the affected individual and the family to short stature through peer support, personal example, and social awareness programs. The LPA offers information on employment, education, disability rights, adoption of children of short stature, medical issues, suitable clothing, adaptive devices, and parenting through local meetings, workshops, seminars, and a national newsletter.

Seizure disorders should be treated in the standard manner.
