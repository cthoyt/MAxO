The management of the individual with familial pulmonary fibrosis (FPF) is

similar to that for interstitial idiopathic pneumonia (IIP) and depends on the

type of IIP diagnosed for each individual within the family [American

Thoracic Society 2000, American Thoracic

Society & European Respiratory Society 2002].

Lung transplantation may be a consideration in selected individuals with FPF. In

general, those who are unresponsive to therapy, have significant functional

impairment, and have no other major illnesses that would preclude

transplantation are good candidates. Five-year survival rates post transplant in

IPF have been estimated at 50%-56% [Raghu et al 2011].

Non-pharmologic treatments:

Oxygen therapy may improve exercise tolerance in patients with

hypoxemia.

Pulmonary rehabilitation is a recommended option for patients who would

benefit.

Pharmacologic interventions have not generally been shown to alter the course of

IPF. Treatments have been categorized into classes such as corticosteroids,

immunosuppressive/cytotoxic agents, and antifibrotic agents. However, at least

two antifibrotic pharmacologic interventions recently approved may be an option

for patients with FPF to slow the decline of lung function. See Therapies Under

Investigation.
