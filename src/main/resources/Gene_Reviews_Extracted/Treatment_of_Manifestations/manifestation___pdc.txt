Treatment focuses on providing alternative energy sources, hydration, and correction of the metabolic acidosis during acute decompensation. Stimulating residual PC enzyme activity is an important goal for long-term stable metabolic status. Correction of the biochemical abnormality can reverse some symptoms, but central nervous system damage progresses regardless of treatment [DiMauro & De Vivo 1999].

“Anaplerotic therapy” is based on the concept that an energy deficit in these diseases could be improved by providing alternative substrate for both the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain for enhanced ATP production [Roe & Mochel 2006].

Citrate supplementation reduces the acidosis and provides substrate for the citric acid cycle [Ahmad et al 1999].

Aspartic acid supplementation allows the urea cycle to proceed and reduces the plasma and urine ammonia concentrations but has little effect on the neurologic disturbances as the aspartate does not enter the brain freely [Ahmad et al 1999]. Lowering the body ammonia burden may mitigate the neurologic insult.

Biotin supplementation is given to help optimize the residual PC enzyme activity but is usually of little use.

Triheptanoin, an odd-carbon triglyceride, providing a source for acetyl-CoA and anaplerotic propionyl-CoA, has been tried in one individual with biotin-unresponsive PC deficiency type B with immediate reversal (<48 h) of major hepatic failure and full correction of all biochemical abnormalities [Mochel et al 2005]. Triheptanoin provides C5-ketone bodies that can cross the blood-brain barrier, therefore providing substrates for the brain. Dietary intervention with triheptanoin is the only therapeutic approach that showed improvement of brain metabolism. However, this observation needs to be confirmed in additional patients.

Orthotopic liver transplantation has reversed the biochemical abnormalities in two patients [Nyhan et al 2002].
