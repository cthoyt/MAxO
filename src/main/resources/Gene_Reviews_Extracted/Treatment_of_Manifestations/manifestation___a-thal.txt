Hb Bart syndrome was previously considered a universally fatal condition, however, its prognosis is shifting because of prenatal diagnosis, intrauterine blood transfusions, improved transfusion strategies, and (rarely) curative hematopoietic stem cell transplant [Pecker et al 2017]. Although the Thalassemia International Guidelines recommend a transfusion strategy similar to Î²-thalassemia for these individuals; however, no reports on optimal transfusion management exist [Amid et al 2016]. Because few children with Hb Bart syndrome survive, clinical trials to assess these treatment approaches are lacking.

The advances in intrauterine and postnatal therapy have resulted in ethical dilemmas for the family and health care provider.

HbH disease. Most individuals with HbH disease are clinically well and survive without any treatment.

Occasional red blood cell transfusions may be needed if the hemoglobin level suddenly drops because of hemolytic or aplastic crises.

Chronic red blood cell transfusions should be considered in selected individuals only. Clear indications for red blood cell transfusions are severe anemia affecting cardiac function and massive erythroid expansion, resulting in severe bone changes and extramedullary erythropoiesis. Note: These events are quite rare in HbH disease.

Iron chelation therapy may be needed in individuals with iron loading caused by regular blood transfusion, inappropriate iron therapy, or abnormal iron absorption.

Splenectomy should be performed only in individuals with massive splenomegaly or hypersplenism; the associated risks for severe, life-threatening sepsis and venous thrombosis should be considered.

Other complications, such as gallstones and leg ulcers, require appropriate medical or surgical treatment.
