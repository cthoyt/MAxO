Some individuals with minor complaints may only need to accommodate their activities and lifestyles to reduce symptoms [Shapiro & Ruff 2002]. Myotonic stiffness may respond to sodium channel blockers or other pharmacologic treatment options:

Mexiletine, a lidocaine derivative, is the best documented treatment option. In a double-blind randomized trial, mexiletine (200 mg 3x/day) significantly reduced stiffness in a group of 59 patients with myotonia, 34 of whom had myotonia congenita [Statland et al 2012]. In clinical practice, doses generally begin at 150 mg twice a day, increasing slowly as needed up to 200-300 mg three times a day. The most common potential side effects, including epigastric discomfort, nausea, lightheadedness, dizziness, tremor, and ataxia, are reversible with dose reduction.

Other sodium channel blockers such as phenytoin and carbamazepine have been reported to have beneficial effects [Conravey & Santana-Gould 2010].

Compounds with other presumed modes of action such as quinine, dantrolene, or acetazolamide may be beneficial in some cases [Shapiro & Ruff 2002].

See review in Conravey & Santana-Gould [2010] for a detailed description of these treatment options.
