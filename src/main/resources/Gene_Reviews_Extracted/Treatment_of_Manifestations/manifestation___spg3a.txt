Therapy for spasticity, distal weakness, and urinary bladder dysfunction, the primary manifestations of SPG3A, is symptomatic.

Spasticity can be treated with:

Oral baclofen or tizanidine

Chemodenervation with botulinum A or B toxins; may be tried in those who do not tolerate oral antispasticity medications

Intrathecal baclofen pump; a good alternative for patients who improve on oral baclofen but cannot tolerate a therapeutic dose because of systemic adverse effects

Each of the above therapies should be combined with intensive physical therapy focused on stretching and strengthening exercises.

The role of surgical therapy for spasticity (including hamstring and heel cord lengthening and release of the adductor longus) remains unknown, but such treatment should be considered if contractures appear. See also Prevention of Secondary Complications.

Distal weakness, typically affecting foot dorsiflexion, can be ameliorated by ankle-foot orthoses; referral to orthotic services may be helpful.

Urinary urgency can be treated with anticholinergic antispasmodic drugs.
