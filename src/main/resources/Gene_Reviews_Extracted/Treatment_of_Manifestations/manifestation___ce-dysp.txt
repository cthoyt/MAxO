Treatment includes the following:

Surgery for correcting craniosynostosis (usually in first year of life) [Sensenbrenner et al 1975, Levin et al 1977, Genitori et al 1992, Gilissen et al 2010, Bacino et al 2012, Hoffer et al 2013].

Correction of polydactyly (optional)

Orthopedic care as required (e.g., for hip dysplasia)

Growth hormone treatment to stimulate growth when standard criteria for this treatment are met [Wilson et al 2003]. Growth hormone should only be prescribed to children with severe growth retardation in whom the therapy is expected to be successful.

Dental care. Timely detection and intervention of structural tooth abnormalities and/or olgiodontia may limit aesthetic, functional, and psychological issues.

Standard treatment for renal and liver abnormalities. While liver transplantation is a treatment option in advanced stages, it has only been proposed once for an individual with CED [Zaffanello et al 2006].

For those with progressive visual impairment, low vision aids and appropriate educational programs

Mechanical ventilation as required in newborns to treat respiratory insufficiency due to pulmonary hypoplasia. Pneumonia should be treated with antibiotics. Patients susceptible to recurrent respiratory infections should be treated with long-term prophylaxis. Asthma can be treated with steroids.

Standard treatment for cardiac abnormalities

For those with developmental delay, speech therapy and physical therapy to improve motor skills and appropriate educational programs

Surgical intervention as required for inguinal/umbilical hernias [Fry et al 2009]
