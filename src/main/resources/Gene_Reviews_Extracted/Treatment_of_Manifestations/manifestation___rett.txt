The treatment program needs to be individualized following an assessment of the affected individual’s clinical problems and needs.

Management is mainly symptomatic and focuses on optimizing the individual's abilities using a dynamic multidisciplinary approach, with specialist input from dietitians, physiotherapists, and occupational, speech, and music therapists [Lotan et al 2004, Weaving et al 2005].

Psychosocial support for families is an integral part of management.

Therapeutic horseback riding, swimming, and music therapy have been reported to be of benefit.

Effective communication strategies, including the use of augmentative communication techniques, need to be explored for these severely disabled individuals [Ryan et al 2004].

Treatment for seizures needs to be individualized with input from a pediatric neurologist. Topiramate may improve seizure control and/or respiratory abnormalities [Goyal et al 2004].

Risperidone (low dose) or selective serotonin uptake inhibitors have been somewhat successful in treating agitation.

Melatonin can ameliorate sleep disturbances [McArthur & Budden 1998]. Chloral hydrate, hydroxyzine, or diphenhydramine may be used along with melatonin.

Ample fluid intake and a high-fiber diet can help prevent acute intestinal obstruction. When diet is ineffective, Miralax® (polyethylene glycol) and other stool softeners may be used to control constipation; they are tolerated better than milk of magnesia.

Anti-reflux agents, smaller and thickened feedings, and positioning can decrease gastroesophageal reflux.

Scoliosis [Kerr et al 2003] and spasticity need to be treated to maintain mobility. Recently, guidelines were developed for the management of scoliosis in Rett syndrome [Downs et al 2009] (full text).

Some individuals known to have prolonged QTc may benefit from the use of β-blockers or cardiac pacing, in consultation with a specialist pediatric cardiologist.
