In nearly all reported cases, the pregnancy was terminated on diagnosis of tetra-amelia syndrome or infants died shortly after birth as a consequence of other malformations including pulmonary hypoplasia. Data on the management of tetra-amelia syndrome therefore do not exist.

It should be noted that (complete) absence of all extremities is principally not incompatible with life. Persons without extremities depend on extensive, life-long assistance with most daily activities. They would require specifically designed wheelchairs with assistive electronic technology and input control devices operated by head, chin, or tongue movements. Other individualized ambulatory devices may be indicated.

Should individuals with tetra-amelia syndrome survive, management depends on the presence and severity of associated malformations and may involve multiple interdisciplinary surgical interventions and the support of several medical disciplines.
