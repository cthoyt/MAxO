Educational. Educational programs appropriate to the developmental and sensory deficits, including training in tactile sign language, should be provided.

Audiologic. Hearing aids have been used in affected males with only variable success [Tranebjaerg et al 1995], probably because of the central location of the auditory damage. The use of cochlear implantation (CI), reported in one instance, had a dubious outcome in a four year-old boy with immunodeficiency and DDON syndrome caused by a de novo deletion of exon 1 of TIMM8A and deletion of exons 17-19 of BTK [Brookes et al 2008].

Dystonia. Dystonia and associated neck pain and spasticity improved over a two-year period in two individuals treated with GABA Î²-agonists [Kreisel et al 2004]. In contrast, symptoms did not seem to improve with treatment with levodopa, carbamazepine, or trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride [Ujike et al 2001].

Favorable short-term outcome as assessed by the Burke-Fahn-Marsden dystonia rating scale from pallidal deep brain stimulation has been reported in two cases of DDON. However, longer-term benefit in additional patients has not yet been reported [Romito et al 2011, Cif et al 2012].

Ophthalmologic. Spectacle correction is appropriate where indicated.
