The management of enlarged parietal foramina is generally conservative. Although surgical closure of parietal bone defects has been advocated and performed [Kortesis et al 2003], its role is controversial. The procedure is not likely to be routinely clinically indicated, given the benign natural history of the skull defects, their tendency to reduce in size with age, and uncertainty as to whether symptoms such as headaches are improved. However, persistent cranium bifidum may warrant operative closure [Perlyn et al 2005].

Associated headaches or seizures should be treated symptomatically.
