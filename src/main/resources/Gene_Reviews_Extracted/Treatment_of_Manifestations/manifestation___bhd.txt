In general, fibrofolliculomas and trichodiscomas are benign lesions for which no treatment is required; however, affected individuals may seek treatment for such lesions for cosmetic purposes, particularly when multiple cutaneous lesions are located on the face. Treatment of fibrofolliculomas and trichodiscomas is difficult, as they tend to be numerous and recurring. Erbium-YAG or fractional CO2 laser ablation may result in substantial improvement, but relapse can occur [Gambichler et al 2000, Jacob & Dover 2001, Kahle et al 2001]. Shaving or other ablative methods have been used with variable results.

Treatment of pneumothorax is the same as in the general population.

Nephron-sparing surgery is the treatment of choice for renal tumors whenever possible, depending on the size and location of the tumors [Pavlovich et al 2005]. Because of the bilateral, multifocal nature of BHDS-associated kidney cancer, a management approach involving observation of small tumors until they reach 3 cm in size is often recommended [Pavlovich et al 2005]. Therefore, renal tumors greater than 3.0 cm and/or rapidly growing tumors usually require partial nephrectomy. When surgical intervention is recommended, an attempt is made to remove all or most of the visible tumors. Although surgical management is not considered “curative” for BHDS-associated renal cell carcinoma (RCC), BHDS-associated renal tumors often are slow growing, and only infrequently are multiple surgical procedures required during a an affected individual’s lifetime to control the tumor burden and prevent the development of metastasis.
