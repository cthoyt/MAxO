When hearing loss is mild to moderate, fitting of hearing aids to provide improved amplification is warranted.

When the hearing loss becomes severe to profound, cochlear implants (CIs) can be considered. In individuals with preserved or relatively good low-frequency hearing and severe-to-profound high-frequency loss, a short electrode may be considered. Short electrodes boost the high frequencies while preserving residual low-frequency hearing.

For school-age children or adolescents, special assistance for the hearing impaired may be warranted and, where available, should be offered.
