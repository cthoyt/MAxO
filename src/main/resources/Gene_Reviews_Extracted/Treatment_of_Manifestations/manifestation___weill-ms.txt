It is not possible to generalize the management of the ocular complications of WMS.

The medical treatment of glaucoma is difficult because of paradoxical response to miotics and mydriatics.

A peripheral iridectomy should be performed to prevent or relieve pupillary block [Chang et al 2002, Ritch et al 2003].

Lens extraction and/or trabeculectomy may be necessary in some persons with advanced chronic angle closure glaucoma [Harasymowycz & Wilson 2004].

Individuals with WMS were recently reported to have increased central corneal thickness, which needs to be considered in the diagnosis and follow-up of glaucoma because increased central corneal thickness may lead to overestimation of intraocular pressure by applanation tonometers [Razeghinejad & Safavian 2006].
