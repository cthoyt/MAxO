Hearing habilitation

for those with nonsyndromic bilateral congenital hearing loss

Hearing aids should be fitted as soon as possible.

Cochlear implantation (CI) should be considered as soon as possible. Case reports have shown good outcomes of CI in individuals with OTOF-related deafness [Rouillon et al 2006, Wu et al 2011] and reviewed in Eppsteiner et al [2012].

Note: In the first one or two years of life, OTOF-related deafness can appear to be an auditory neuropathy based on electrophysiologic testing; however, with time electrophysiologic testing becomes more consistent with a cochlear defect. Distinguishing between an auditory neuropathy and a cochlear defect is important as cochlear implants may be of marginal value in persons with auditory neuropathy such as that observed in deafness-dystonia-optic neuronopathy (DDON) [Brookes et al 2008] as well as individuals with deafness caused by pathogenic variants in spiral ganglion-expressed genes [Eppsteiner et al 2012].

Educational programs designed for individuals with hearing impairment are appropriate.
