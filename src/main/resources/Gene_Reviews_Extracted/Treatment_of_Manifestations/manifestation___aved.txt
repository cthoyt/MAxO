The treatment of choice for AVED is lifelong high-dose oral vitamin E supplementation. Some symptoms (e.g., ataxia and intellectual deterioration) can be reversed if treatment is initiated early in the disease process [Schuelke et al 1999]. In older individuals, disease progression can be stopped, but deficits in proprioception and gait unsteadiness generally remain [Gabsi et al 2001, Mariotti et al 2004, El Euch-Fayache et al 2014]. With treatment, plasma vitamin E concentrations can become normal.

In presymptomatic individuals, the manifestations of AVED can be prevented if vitamin E supplementation is initiated early [El Euch-Fayache et al 2014].

No large-scale therapeutic studies have been performed to determine optimal vitamin E dosage and to evaluate outcomes.

The reported vitamin E dose ranges from 800 mg to 1500 mg (or 40 mg/kg body weight in children) [Burck et al 1981, Harding et al 1985, Amiel et al 1995, Cavalier et al 1998, Schuelke et al 1999, Schuelke et al 2000b, Gabsi et al 2001, Mariotti et al 2004].

One of the following vitamin E preparations is used:

The chemically manufactured racemic form, all-rac-α-tocopherol acetate

The naturally occurring form, RRR-α-tocopherol

It is currently unknown whether affected individuals should be treated with all-rac-α-tocopherol acetate or with RRR-α-tocopherol. It is known that alpha-TTP (αTPP) stereoselectively binds and transports 2R-α-tocopherols [Weiser et al 1996, Hosomi et al 1997, Leonard et al 2002]. For some TTPA pathogenic variants, this stereoselective binding capacity is lost and affected individuals cannot discriminate between RRR- and SRR-α-tocopherol [Traber et al 1993, Cavalier et al 1998]. In this instance, affected individuals would also be able to incorporate non-2R-α-tocopherol stereoisomers into their bodies if they were supplemented with all-rac-α-tocopherol. Since potential adverse effects of the synthetic stereoisomers have not been studied in detail, it seems appropriate to treat with RRR-α-tocopherol, despite the higher cost.
