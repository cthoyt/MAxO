Treatment is supportive. No specific therapy for PPD is available.

Pain due to secondary osteoarthritis may respond to NSAIDs. Other anti-inflammatory medications including steroids and immunosuppressive drugs (cyclosporine and methotrexate) have a limited role in treatment and are best avoided in view of their significant side effects.

Physical therapy may help preserve joint mobility. Immobilization (e.g., casting) should be avoided.

Most joint involvement requires intervention by an orthopedist and/or physical therapist.

Angular deformities of lower limbs. The indications for surgical correction are to restore normal alignment of the lower limbs and to alleviate gait disturbance, instability, and/or pain.

Progressive joint stiffness

Large joint stiffness is managed by physical therapy, activity modification, and walking aids.

Small joint arthropathy is managed by an occupational therapist who may advise adaptive devices, modification of activity, and/or vocational training.

Joint pain. Severe joint pain due to advanced osteoarthritis is treated by joint arthroplasty (i.e., hip and knee replacement). Early hip replacement (second decade of life) can be successful in relieving pain and restoring the ability to ambulate.

Progressive stiffness and deformities of the spine

Scoliosis and mild kyphosis can be managed with bracing.

Spinal canal stenosis can be managed with decompression, fusion, and instrumentation.
