Currently there is no definitive treatment. Management should involve a multidisciplinary team.

Feeding difficulties should be managed aggressively, including use of a nasogastric tube or gastrostomy tube when the risk of aspiration is high.

Physical therapy can help maintain muscle function and prevent joint contractures. A physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R) specialist can be helpful for individuals with walking difficulty. As mobility becomes increasingly restricted, the use of a wheelchair should be considered.

Early referral to a pediatric pulmonologist is recommended for assessment of pulmonary function and the need for chest physiotherapy to improve pulmonary function and reduce the risk of pulmonary infection. Pulmonary infection should be treated urgently in a standard manner to prevent deterioration in pulmonary function capacity. Once the patient becomes ventilator dependent due to respiratory compromise, chest physiotherapy can help reduce the risk of pulmonary infection.
