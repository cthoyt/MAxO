Nonsurgical treatment of ophthalmologic findings:

Refractive errors may be managed with spectacles or contact lenses. Specialist examination is required to detect refractive errors early in life, when affected individuals may be asymptomatic, to prevent amblyopia and avoid compounding the motility problem with a focusing problem.

Amblyopia can be treated effectively with occlusion or penalization of the better-seeing eye. Early detection (in the first years of life) maximizes the likelihood of a good response to treatment.

Lubrication of ocular surface (particularly cornea) may be required. In cases of severe exposure, a PROSE lens can be of significant benefit [Papakostas et al 2015].

Surgical treatment of ophthalmologic findings (extraocular muscle and/or ptosis surgery):

Correction of ptosis

Eye muscle surgery

To correct or improve a compensatory head posture

To improve alignment in primary gaze position

To improve ambulation and gross motor development in young children

Principles of surgical approach:

Orbital imaging is recommended before surgery to assess muscle size and position.

Extraocular muscles may be found at surgery to be attached in unexpected locations.

Resections or plications may be helpful in some cases to provide traction against large recessions during healing.

Surgery is likely to be technically difficult because of tightness of rectus muscles.

Recessions need to be larger – sometimes considerably larger – than indicated by standard tables, especially recessions of the inferior rectus muscles.

Dysinnervation causing esotropia in attempted upgaze may mask an underlying exotropia that will be unmasked after inferior rectus muscle weakening.

Inferior rectus muscle weakening may be enhanced by superior oblique weakening.

Profound weakening procedures (e.g., suturing muscle to orbital rim, rectus muscle myectomy) may be necessary.

Botulinum toxin may be helpful for residual misalignment in some cases.
