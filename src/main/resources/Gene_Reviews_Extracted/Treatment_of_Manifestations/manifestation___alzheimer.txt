The mainstay of treatment for Alzheimer disease (AD) is necessarily supportive and each symptom is managed on an individual basis [Bird & Miller 2008]. In general, affected individuals eventually require assisted living arrangements or care in a nursing home.

Although the exact biochemical basis of AD is not well understood, it is known that deficiencies of the brain cholinergic system and of other neurotransmitters are present. Drugs that increase cholinergic activity by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase produce a modest but useful behavioral or cognitive benefit in a minority of affected individuals. The first such drug was tacrine; however, this agent is also hepatotoxic. Newer such drugs with similar pharmacologic action, such as donepezil (Aricept®) [Feldman et al 2004, Seltzer et al 2004, Petersen et al 2005], rivastigmine (Exelon®) [Feldman et al 2007], and galantamine [Raskind et al 2000, Tariot et al 2000, Mega et al 2005, Reisberg et al 2006, Atri et al 2008], are not hepatotoxic.

Memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, has shown some effectiveness in the treatment of moderate to severe AD [Reisberg et al 2003, Tariot et al 2004].

Antidepressant medication may improve associated depression.

Agitation is especially difficult to control [Teri et al 2000, Mintzer et al 2006]
