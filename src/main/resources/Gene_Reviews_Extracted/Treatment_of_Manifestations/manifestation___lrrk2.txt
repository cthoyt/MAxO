The treatment of individuals with LRRK2-related PD does not differ from that of idiopathic PD.

The mainstay of treatment is pharmacologic replacement of dopamine, most commonly accomplished with the precursor of dopamine, L-dopa, combined with carbi-dopa.

Dopamine agonists may also be used, as well as inhibitors of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) or monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B).

The motor impairment generally responds well to dopamine therapy (agonists and levodopa).

Other medications include anticholinergics, selegiline, and amantadine [Lang & Lozano 1998a, Lang & Lozano 1998b, Hristova & Koller 2000, Marjama-Lyons & Koller 2001, Olanow & Stocchi 2004].

Neurosurgical procedures such as deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus/globus pallidus interna or pallido-pontine nucleus benefit some individuals in whom dyskinesias or gait disoders are especially problematic. Less commonly, pallidotomy (or, rarely, fetal brain transplant to the caudate nucleus) may also provide benefit [Esselink et al 2004, Schüpbach et al 2007, Gómez-Esteban et al 2008, Munhoz et al 2009].

Individuals with Parkinson disease may benefit from physical, occupational, and speech therapy.

To date, limited effective treatment exists for non-motor findings, which can be extremely disabling.
