Management of individuals with FLNA-related PVNH is directed toward symptomatic treatment.

Treatment of epilepsy generally follows basic principles for a seizure disorder caused by a known structural brain abnormality, including:

Detailed initial history and evaluation to confirm the suspicion of a seizure disorder. Testing may include an electroencephalogram (EEG) to define the location and severity of electrical brain dysfunction that may be present in individuals with epilepsy.

Repeat imaging may be necessary only in the setting of new neurologic findings on examination.

Treatment with antiepileptic agents. Choice of antiepileptics is generally made empirically based on the clinical features of the seizure disorder. However, because no significant differences exist between medications for newly diagnosed, presumably localized epilepsy, choices may be made on the specific attributes of each antiepileptic drug (i.e., risk of teratogenicity of the antiepileptic drug during pregnancy), tolerability, and efficacy.

Because of the risk for aortic or carotid dissection, it may also be wise to ensure good blood pressure control.

Treatment of aortic/carotid dissection, congenital heart disease, and valvular disease is the same as in the general population.

Many individuals with periventricular nodular heterotopia have dyslexia. Therefore, it may be prudent for those with a family history of PVNH to have children tested for dyslexia at an early age.
