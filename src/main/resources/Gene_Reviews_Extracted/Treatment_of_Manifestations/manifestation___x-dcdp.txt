Orthopedic management of leg length discrepancy; surgical correction of polydactyly; frequent assessment of kyphoscoliosis, which can progress rapidly at any age

Cataract extraction and correction of vision

Dermatologic management of skin lesions

Physical, occupational, and speech therapies, if necessary

Standard interventions for congenital heart defects, kidney anomalies, and hearing loss
