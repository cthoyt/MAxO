Treatment focuses on symptomatic therapy.

Feeding and nutrition. Supplying adequate calorie intake for affected children often entails the placement of a gastrostomy tube to allow simpler home management. No specific metabolic diet is recommended. With many children having some degree of malabsorption, elemental formulas may be better tolerated.

Hearing. Hearing aids should be used in children found to have hearing impairment. (See also Hereditary Hearing Loss and Deafness Overview for discussion of management issues.)

Vision. Cataract removal in early infancy to preserve vision is appropriate. Glasses should be used as needed to correct refractive errors.

Liver. Supplementation of vitamin K and other fat-soluble vitamins is recommended.

Liver dysfunction may lead to varices that respond to sclerosing therapies.

Primary bile acid therapy may improve liver function by reducing the accumulation of cholestanoic acids [Setchell et al 1992].

Neurologic function. Early intervention services should be provided.

Seizures are present in approximately one third of affected individuals. Standard antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) may be used. No type of AED is contraindicated. Seizures may be difficult to control despite use of appropriate medication.
