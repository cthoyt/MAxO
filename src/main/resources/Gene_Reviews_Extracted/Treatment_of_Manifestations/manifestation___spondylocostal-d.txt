In the majority of individuals treatment is conservative because the vertebral and rib malformations cause progressive difficulties:

Respiratory support, including intensive care as needed, to treat acute respiratory distress and chronic respiratory failure

Routine treatment of inguinal herniae

Surgical intervention as needed if scoliosis is significant. External bracing, for example by use of an expandable prosthetic titanium rib [Ramirez et al 2010], may be attempted but experience is limited.
