As with all children with functional craniofacial malformations, management through an established craniofacial team is recommended.

While management protocols are likely to differ among craniofacial teams, it is generally accepted that individuals with SCS should undergo cranioplasty in the first year of life.

Cranioplasty involves extensive surgery to release fused sutures including repositioning and reconstruction of the malformed calvaria. It prevents the following:

Progressive facial asymmetry that can develop in individuals with unilateral or asymmetric coronal fusion

Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) that can develop in individuals with multiple sutural synostosis (bicoronal or other sutures)

Progressive hypertropia resulting from overaction of the ipsilateral inferior oblique muscle in cases of unilateral coronal synostosis [Weiss & Phillips 2006].

In some circumstances, midfacial surgery is necessary during childhood to address dental malocclusion, swallowing difficulties, or respiratory problems.

If cleft palate is present, it is treated as in other disorders, including surgical closure, assurance of adequate feeding and weight gain, and speech therapy. In most cases, cranioplasty precedes palatal repair.

Orthodontic treatment and/or orthognathic surgery may be required at or near the completion of facial growth.

If developmental delay is identified, early intervention and/or special education are appropriate.

Hearing loss, if present, should be treated in a standard manner (see Deafness and Hereditary Hearing Loss Overview).

Ophthalmologic abnormalities are treated in a standard fashion. Ptosis and strabismus should be corrected during early childhood to prevent amblyopia, either with patching or surgery.
