Cutaneous lesions. Cutaneous leiomyomas should be examined by a dermatologist. Treatment of cutaneous leiomyomas is difficult:

Surgical excision may be performed for a solitary painful lesion.

Lesions can be treated by cryoablation and/or lasers.

Several medications, including calcium channel blockers, alpha blockers, nitroglycerin, antidepressants, and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), have been reported to reduce pain [Ritzmann et al 2006].

Uterine fibroids should be evaluated by a gynecologist. The uterine fibroids of HLRCC are treated in the same manner as sporadic fibroids. However, most women with HLRCC may require medical and/or surgical intervention earlier than the general population. Medical therapy (currently including gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists [GnRHa], antihormonal medications, and pain relievers) may be used initially to treat uterine fibroids, to decrease the size of fibroids in preparation for surgical removal, and/or to provide temporary relief from the symptoms of fibroids. When possible, myomectomy to remove fibroids while preserving the uterus is the treatment of choice. Hysterectomy should be performed only when necessary.

Renal tumors. Early detection of kidney tumor in HLRCC is important. Surgical excision of these malignancies appears to require earlier and more extensive surgery than other hereditary kidney cancers. Further studies may demonstrate that even small tumors have a high grade of malignancy on pathologic review. Kidney tumors associated with HLRCC have an aggressive disease course. Therefore, these tumors must be managed with caution until more is known about the natural history. Because of the aggressive nature of renal cancers associated with HLRCC, total nephrectomy should be strongly considered in individuals with a detectable renal mass.
