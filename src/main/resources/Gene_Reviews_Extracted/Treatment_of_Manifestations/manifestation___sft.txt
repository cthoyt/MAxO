Persons with sialuria need symptomatic and supportive management, including treatment of anemia, prolonged but mild jaundice, and convulsions. Barbiturates have been more effective in treating the occasional convulsion in early childhood than other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).

Affected individuals benefit from early developmental intervention and appropriate educational programs.
