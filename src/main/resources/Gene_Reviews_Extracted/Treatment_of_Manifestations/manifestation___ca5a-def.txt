During acute episodes. Admit to the hospital children with insufficient intake or refusal to take anything orally and/or signs of metabolic decompensation such as encephalopathy. The following are recommended:

Always provide IV fluids (with glucose at maintenance doses) and extra calories via IV lipids; restrict protein intake if plasma ammonia is elevated.

Always monitor plasma ammonia, serum lactate, serum glucose, blood gases, electrolytes, and liver parameters.

Consider administration of carglumic acid (which – though not approved yet for this indication – enhances CPS1 activity and thus partially compensates for reduced HCO3- resulting from CA-VA deficiency). In the three children who were given carglumic acid during the acute phase, hyperammonemia and clinical symptoms resolved within 12 hours. Without carglumic acid, hyperammonemia persisted longer (i.e., an additional 1-2 days).

Other ammonia-lowering medications such as sodium benzoate would also be reasonable.

To prevent metabolic decompensation during any catabolic state (viral illness or fasting conditions)

Use a sick day formula (extra calories, with limited proteins and extra lipids).

Monitor plasma ammonia, serum glucose, blood gases, serum lactate, and plasma amino acids (frequency according to patient’s clinical state and physician’s expertise).
