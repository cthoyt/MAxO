Appropriate management of males with DMD/BMD can prolong survival and improve quality of life.

Dilated cardiomyopathy. Recommendations are based on an American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement and various additional publications [American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery 2005, Jefferies et al 2005, Viollet et al 2012].

A retrospective observational study found that ventricular remodeling may occur in males with DMD and BMD with early diagnosis and treatment of cardiomyopathy [Jefferies et al 2005]. Among 69 affected boys with a first echocardiogram indicating dilated cardiomyopathy (e.g., LVEP <55% or left ventricular dilation), 27 with DMD and four with BMD were started on an ACE inhibitor at a mean age of 15 years. If echocardiography at three months showed no improvement, a beta blocker (carvedilol or metoprolol) was added. When these 31 individuals had repeat echocardiography at a mean of 3.3 years later, left ventricular size and function had normalized in 19 (66%), improved in eight (26%), and stabilized in two (8%). Mean LVEF increased from 36% to 53%. Measurement of reduced sphericity indicated improved ventricular geometry.

Whether this therapy reverses the cardiomyopathy or only masks the manifestations of a progressive process is not clear; however, a more recent study [Duboc et al 2005] lends support to the hypothesis that early introduction of afterload reduction therapy may lead to improved preservation of myocardial function and reduced mortality [Colan 2005, Duboc et al 2007]. Further studies are underway to create evidence-based recommendations for the prevention and treatment of cardiomyopathy in men with DMD/BMD.

The authors' institution commonly treats children with DMD or BMD early with an ACE inhibitor and/or beta blocker. When used in combination, these appear to lead to initial improvement of left ventricular function; however, ACE inhibitors are also used without beta blockers. The impact of combined prophylactic treatment is currently under investigation in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. The optimal time to start treatment in DMD is unknown, but most cardiologists will initiate treatment when the LVEF drops below 55% and fractional shortening is less than 28% [Jefferies et al 2005, Viollet et al 2012]. Angiotensin II-receptor blockers (ARBs) such as losartan are similarly effective and can be used in cases of poor tolerability of ACE inhibitors [Allen et al 2013]. In cases of overt heart failure, other heart failure therapies including diuretics and digoxin are used as needed. Cardiac transplantation is offered to persons with severe dilated cardiomyopathy and BMD with limited or no clinical evidence of skeletal muscle disease.

Scoliosis treatment as needed is appropriate.

Corticosteroid Therapy

Studies have shown that corticosteroids improve the strength and function of individuals with DMD.

Prednisone. It is hypothesized that prednisone/prednisolone has a stabilizing effect on membranes and perhaps an anti-inflammatory effect:

In a randomized double-blind six-month trial, prednisone administered at a dose of either 0.75 mg/kg/day or 1.5 mg/kg/day increased strength and reduced the rate of decline in males with DMD [Mendell et al 1989].

In two successive six-month trials of prednisone therapy, improvement began within ten days of starting the treatment, required a single dose of 0.75 mg/kg/day of prednisone for maximal improvement, reached a plateau after three months, and was sustained for as long as three years in those children maintained on doses of 0.5 and 0.6 mg/kg/day [Fenichel et al 1991].

One open-label study suggested that therapy with prednisone could prolong ambulation by two years. Side effects include weight gain (>20% of baseline) (in 40%), hypertension, behavioral changes, growth retardation, cushingoid appearance (in 50%), and cataracts [Mendell et al 1989, Griggs et al 1993].

Follow-up studies showed that a dose of 0.75 mg/kg/day was more beneficial than a dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day [Fenichel et al 1991]. However, a subsequent study proved the effectiveness of lower doses of prednisolone (0.35 mg/kg/day) in both DMD and BMD. One of the authors noted sustained effectiveness with doses initiated at 0.75 mg/kg/day (maximum daily dose: 40 mg) and gradually reduced (usually because of advancing age and weight gain) to as low as 0.4 mg/kg/day. At lower doses of 0.3 mg/kg/day, the improvement is less robust [Darras, personal communication].

Alternate-day dosing and intermittent dosing (e.g., 10 days “on,” 10 or 20 days “off”) are also used.

A study showed reduced incidence of side effects by high-dose (5 mg/kg), twice-weekly dosing [Connolly et al 2002].

A randomized, cross-over, controlled trial of intermittent prednisone (0.75 mg/kg/day) therapy (prednisone or placebo) during the first ten days of each month for six months showed that prednisone slowed deterioration of muscle function in individuals with DMD [Beenakker et al 2005]; side effects did not negatively affect quality of life.

Similar conclusions regarding the effect and side-effect profile of prednisone treatment for DMD were reached by a Cochrane systematic review [Manzur et al 2004, Manzur et al 2008] and also by the 124th European Neuromuscular Centre workshop on the treatment of DMD [Bushby et al 2004].

High-dose weekly prednisone, 5 mg/kg, given each Friday and Saturday (total 10 mg/kg/week) can be considered as an alternative to daily treatment in males on a daily regimen with excessive weight gain and behavioral issues [Bushby et al 2010a].

Whether the improvement seen in individuals with DMD treated with prednisone is the result of an immunosuppressive effect remains unclear, as individuals treated with azathioprine did not have a beneficial effect.

Deflazacort, a synthetic derivative of prednisolone used in Europe but not currently available in all countries (e.g. U.S.A.), is thought to have fewer side effects than prednisone, particularly with regard to weight gain [Angelini 2007]. A larger study comparing deflazacort to prednisone, carried out in Europe, showed that the two medications were similarly or equally effective in slowing the decline of muscle strength in DMD. Another European multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial of deflazacort versus prednisone in DMD showed equal efficacy in improving motor function and functional performance [Bonifati et al 2000]. A more recent study of deflazacort treatment showed efficacy in preserving pulmonary function as well as gross motor function [Biggar et al 2006].

In a comparison of two different protocols of deflazacort treatment in DMD, a 0.9-mg/kg/day dose was more effective than a dose of 0.6 mg/kg/day for the first 20 days of the month and no deflazacort for the remainder of the month [Biggar et al 2004]; 30% of children on the highest dose developed asymptomatic cataracts that required no treatment. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 studies showed that deflazacort improved strength and motor function more than placebo; whether it has a benefit over prednisone on similar outcomes remains unclear [Campbell & Jacob 2003]. Despite the lack of conclusive evidence for superiority of deflazacort over prednisone in the area of effectiveness [Moxley et al 2005], some experts believe that the more favorable side-effect profile (particularly with regard to weight gain) associated with deflazacort makes it a better choice than daily treatment with prednisone.

Initiation and length of treatment. Data regarding the optimal age to begin treatment with corticosteroids or the optimal duration of such treatment are insufficient. It has been proposed that individuals with DMD begin treatment with low-dose prednisone as soon as the diagnosis is made (age 2-5 years) [Merlini et al 2003]; however, large-scale controlled trials to study the efficacy and safety of corticosteroid therapy in early DMD have yet to be conducted. A large, NIH-funded multicenter blind randomized trial (FOR DMD) comparing the efficacy, tolerability, and side effects of three regimens (prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day, prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day switching between ten days on and ten days off treatment, and deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day) is currently being conducted in young (4–7 year old) steroid-naïve children with DMD. Thus, at this point corticosteroid therapy remains the treatment of choice for affected individuals between ages five and 15 years. Corticosteroid therapy is not recommended in children under age two years [Bushby et al 2010a].

Published guidelines. The following recommendations for corticosteroid therapy are in accordance with the national practice parameters developed by the American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society [Moxley et al 2005] (full text).

Boys with DMD who are older than age five years should be offered treatment with prednisone (0.75/mg/kg/day, maximum daily dose: 40 mg) as soon as plateauing or decline in motor skills is noted. Prior to the initiation of therapy, the potential benefits and risks of corticosteroid treatment should be carefully discussed with each individual.

To assess benefits of corticosteroid therapy, the following parameters are useful: timed muscle function tests, pulmonary function tests, and age at loss of independent ambulation.

To assess risks of corticosteroid therapy, maintain awareness of the potential corticosteroid therapy side effects (e.g., weight gain, cushingoid appearance, short stature, decrease in linear growth, acne, excessive hair growth, gastrointestinal symptoms, behavioral changes). There is also an increased frequency of vertebral and long bone fractures with prolonged corticosteroid use [King et al 2007].

The optimal maintenance dose of prednisone (0.75 mg/kg/day) should be continued if side effects are not severe. Significant but less robust improvement can be seen with gradual tapering of prednisone to as low as 0.3 mg/kg/day.

If excessive weight gain occurs (>20% over estimated normal weight for height over a 12-month period), the prednisone dose should be decreased to 0.5 mg/kg/day. If excessive weight gain continues, the dose should be further decreased to 0.3 mg/kg/day after three to four months.

Deflazacort (0.9 mg/kg/day, maximum daily dose: 36-39 mg) can also be used to treat DMD. Side effects of asymptomatic cataracts and weight gain should be monitored.

BMD. Information about the efficacy of prednisone in treating individuals with BMD is limited. Many clinicians continue treatment with glucocorticoids after loss of ambulation for the purpose of maintaining upper limb strength, delaying the progressive decline of respiratory and cardiac function, and decreasing the risk of scoliosis. Retrospective data suggest that the progression of scoliosis can be reduced by long-term daily corticosteroid treatment; however, an increased risk for vertebral and lower-limb fractures has been documented [King et al 2007]. Men on steroid therapy were less likely to require spinal surgery [Dooley et al 2010b].
