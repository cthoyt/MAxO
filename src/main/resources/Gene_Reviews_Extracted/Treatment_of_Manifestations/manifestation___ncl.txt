Symptomatic treatment can be successful in mitigating the manifestations of NCL. Seizures, sleep-related problems, malnutrition, gastroesophageal reflux, pneumonia, sialorrhea, hyperactivity and behavior problems, psychosis, anxiety, spasticity, Parkinsonian symptoms, and dystonia can be palliated.

Seizures. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) should be selected with caution. The stage of the disease, age of the affected individual, and quality of life are important to consider in evaluating the effectiveness of AEDs.

Lamotrigine (LTG) had a favorable effect on 23/28 individuals with JNCL, 13/19 being continued on monotherapy with 100% control, compared to 70% control for those receiving valproic acid (VPA), 60% control for VPA-clonazepam (CZP), and 60% control for LTG-CZP [Aberg et al 1999, Aberg et al 2000].

Other newer AEDs including levetiracetam and topiramate may also be beneficial [Author, personal experience].

Other. Benzodiazepines may be of benefit for seizures, anxiety, spasticity, and sleep disorders.

Trihexyphenydil improves dystonia and sialorrhea.

Individuals with swallowing problems may benefit from placement of a gastric (G) tube.

Antidepressants and antipsychotic agents are sometimes indicated for those with CLN3 disease.
