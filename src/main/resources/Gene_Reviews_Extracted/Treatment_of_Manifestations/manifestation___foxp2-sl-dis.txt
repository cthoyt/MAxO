Speech and language deficits. A speech pathologist will utilize treatments targeted to the specific findings in an affected individual; hence, the importance of a thorough initial assessment to establish the extent of disease and management needs for an individual. No single recommended treatment exists.

The optimal approach should be determined based on the individualâ€™s findings regarding:

CAS [American Speech-Language-Hearing Association 2007, Morgan & Vogel 2008, Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists 2011];

Dysarthria [Pennington et al 2009];

Language deficits [Law et al 2003];

Literacy impairments [Snowling & Hulme 2012].

Cognitive deficits. A clinical psychologist or neuropsychologist may provide strategies to help manage deficits in specific cognitive or social skill domains.

Fine and gross motor deficits. An occupational therapist and physiotherapist can provide strategies to help with these issues.
