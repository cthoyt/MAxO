No management guidelines have been published.

The majority of individuals with PFCP require no regular treatment.

In some individuals with PFCP, antihypertensive treatment and phlebotomies are initiated either:

When symptoms of the hyperviscosity syndrome are evident;

OR

At routine intervals to maintain the hematocrit at an almost normal level.

While low-dose aspirin can be considered for the prevention of thromboembolic events, no evidence of efficacy exists. Of note, at least one individual (a male age 40 yrs) died from myocardial infarction despite regularly performed phlebotomies [Prchal & Sokol 1996].

Hyperviscosity symptoms (see

Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis)

Grade 1. Consider aspirin treatment.

Grade 2. Consider aspirin treatment. In the presence of persistent symptoms perform phlebotomy. In the event of recurrent episodes consider regular phlebotomy to maintain the hematocrit in the age-respective normal range.

Grade 3. Consider regular phlebotomy to maintain hematocrit in the age-respective normal range. Consider additional aspirin treatment.

Thromboembolic events

Provide acute treatment according to established practice for the event.

Evaluate for other thrombophilic risk factors.

Start regular phlebotomy to maintain hematocrit in the age-respective normal range. Consider additional aspirin treatment in all patients.

Consider life-long anticoagulation (e.g., heparins, warfarin) when other severe additional risk factors are present or thromboembolic events have recurred.
