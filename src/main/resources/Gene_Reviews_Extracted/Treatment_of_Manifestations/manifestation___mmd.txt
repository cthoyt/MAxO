Treatment is aimed at prevention of disease manifestations, early diagnosis by regular screening, and aggressive management of complications that may develop. Effective treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach that can improve both quality of life and survival for the affected individual.

Ongoing careful assessment of the potential need for part-time or permanent respiratory support is absolutely critical, as affected individuals may rapidly enter respiratory crisis or may unknowingly suffer from potentially fatal nocturnal hypoventilation.

Feeding support with tube/gavage feeds is needed if oral intake is poor. Failure to thrive may need to be overcome with high-caloric density formulas/feeds. Gastroesophageal reflux (if present) is treated in the usual manner.

Physical and occupational therapy may help to improve/maintain gross motor and fine motor functions.

Speech therapy should be provided for individuals with dysarthria/hypernasal speech.
