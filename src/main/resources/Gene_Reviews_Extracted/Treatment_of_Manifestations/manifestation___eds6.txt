Musculoskeletal

Referral to an orthopedic surgeon for management of kyphoscoliosis is appropriate.

Orthopedic surgery is not contraindicated in individuals with EDS, kyphoscoliotic form and can be performed as necessary.

Bracing may be required to support unstable joints.

Physical therapy is recommended for older children, adolescents, and adults to strengthen large muscle groups, particularly at the shoulder girdle, and to prevent recurrent shoulder dislocation. Swimming is recommended.

Due to skin fragility, protective pads over knees, shins, and elbows may be helpful in preventing lacerations, particularly in children. The use of helmets in active sports is always advised.

Cardiovascular

Vigilant observation and control of blood pressure can reduce the risk of arterial rupture.

Vascular surgery is fraught with danger. Although virtually no surgical literature exists on EDS, kyphoscoliotic form, the review by Freeman et al [1996] on surgical complications of EDS, vascular type is relevant.

Individuals with aortic dilation may require treatment with beta blockers to prevent further expansion.

Ophthalmologic

Myopia and/or astigmatism may be corrected by glasses or contact lenses.

Laser treatment of the retina is indicated in case of imminent detachment.
