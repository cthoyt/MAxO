Treatment should be tailored to the specific needs of the individual. Those with developmental delays, cognitive disability, behavioral problems, or psychological phenotypes (autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia) should be evaluated by a neurodevelopmental pediatrician or clinical psychologist/psychiatrist for treatment recommendations.

Seizures should be managed by a neurologist using standard practice.

Individuals with cardiac, ophthalmic, or renal abnormalities should be managed by the appropriate specialist.
