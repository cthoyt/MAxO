The physical manifestations of Fryns syndrome are treated by surgery and/or supportive measures in the same way that the same manifestations are treated when they are not part of a syndrome. However, treatment of the diaphragmatic hernia often takes precedence over the management of other anomalies present.

For congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), the neonate is immediately intubated to prevent inflation of herniated bowel.

Medical therapies are used to stabilize the infant prior to surgical repair. High-frequency oscillatory ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have achieved recent popularity in the treatment of CDH [Fallon et al 2013] but proof of improved survival with ECMO has not been established [Losty 2014]. Nitric oxide and surfactant have also been trialed as therapies for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN).

In Fryns syndrome, additional anomalies may dictate further consultations; management by a pediatric neurologist, pediatric cardiologist, pediatric gastroenterologist, pediatric nephrologist, and a craniofacial team may be appropriate.
