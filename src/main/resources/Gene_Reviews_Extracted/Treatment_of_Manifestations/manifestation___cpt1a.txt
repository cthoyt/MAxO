Guidelines for the treatment of CPT1A deficiency can be found at newbornscreening.info and ghr.nlm.nih.gov.

When individuals present with acute hypoglycemia, sufficient amounts of intravenous fluid containing 10% dextrose should be provided as quickly as possible to correct hypoglycemia and to prevent lipolysis and subsequent mobilization of fatty acids into the mitochondria.

Because individuals presenting with profound hypoglycemia have little to no residual hepatic glycogen, treating physicians should continue the glucose infusion beyond the time that blood glucose concentration has normalized in order to provide sufficient substrate for glycogen synthesis.

A letter should be provided to affected individuals (or their parents/guardians) and involved health care providers alerting them to the potentially catastrophic metabolic crises for which these individuals are at risk and explaining the appropriate emergency treatment.
