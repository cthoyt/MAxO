Hearing loss should be assessed and treated by a multidisciplinary team including an audiologist and otolaryngologist. Possible interventions include hearing aids, vibrotactile devices, and cochlear implantation. Cochlear implantation can be considered in children older than age 12 months with severe-to-profound hearing loss. Provision should be made for any special educational needs.

Early intervention in young children with profound hearing loss improves cognitive and language development.

Ovarian insufficiency. In adolescents presenting with primary amenorrhea, induction of puberty with incremental doses of estrogen should be undertaken in collaboration with a pediatric endocrinologist. In those in whom puberty is complete, cyclic estrogen and progesterone is administered to mimic the menstrual cycle and to trigger withdrawal bleeds. Estrogen can be administered orally or topically.

Estrogen has a long-term protective effect on bone metabolism and reduces the risk for early-onset osteoporosis. Treatment should last until at least age 50 years to reduce risks of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis, provided there are no contraindications to estrogen replacement.

Assisted reproduction through in vitro fertilization using donor eggs is a consideration for women with Perrault syndrome. Before considering pregnancy, uterine size should be assessed.

For women at risk for ovarian insufficiency, oocyte cryopreservation can be considered if ovarian function is sufficiently well preserved to allow for successful harvesting of oocytes.
