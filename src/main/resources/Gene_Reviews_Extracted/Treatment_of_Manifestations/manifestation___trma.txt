Thiamine

Management focuses on lifelong use of pharmacologic doses (50-100 mg/day) of oral thiamine (vitamin B1) in affected individuals regardless of age.

High-dose thiamine supplementation:

Invariably improves the hematologic picture;

Did not prevent the development of hearing loss in infants with TRMA in some studies [Borgna-Pignatti et al 2009, AkÄ±n et al 2011]. The efficacy of high-dose thiamine in improving hearing or delaying hearing loss has been difficult to study and remains unclear.

May delay onset of diabetes mellitus, and may ameliorate diabetes mellitus in the short term and perhaps even for decades [Valerio et al 1998]. Insulin requirements are reduced with thiamine therapy in some cases [Neufeld et al 1997].

Has not been evaluated as a treatment for optic atrophy, cardiovascular abnormalities, or neurologic abnormalities associated with TRMA.

Additional Treatment

Red blood cell transfusion for severe anemia is indicated.

See Deafness and Hereditary Hearing Loss Overview for treatment strategies for hearing loss. Treatment has included cochlear implant [Hagr 2014].

Diabetes, cardiovascular abnormalities, and neurologic disorders should be treated in the standard manner.
