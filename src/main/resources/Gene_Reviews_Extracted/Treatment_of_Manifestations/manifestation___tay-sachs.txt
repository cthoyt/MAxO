For the most part, treatment for Tay-Sachs disease is supportive and directed to providing adequate nutrition and hydration, managing infectious disease, protecting the airway, and controlling seizures.

Seizure control can usually be achieved using conventional antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) such as benzodiazepines, phenytoins, and/or barbiturates. However, seizures are progressive and change in type and severity; thus, over time changes in the dose or type of AEDs may be necessary for optimal seizure control.

For older individuals with adult-onset hexosaminidase A deficiency who have psychiatric manifestations, conventional antipsychotic or antidepressant therapy may be used; but the clinical response is unpredictable and generally poor.

Treatment with lithium salts and electroconvulsive therapy has been reported to be beneficial, at least in ameliorating for a period the episodes of psychotic depression.
