Treatment is symptomatic. Affected individuals are often evaluated and managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes neurologists, physiatrists, orthopedic surgeons, and physical and occupational therapists [Grandis & Shy 2005, McCorquodale et al 2016].

The following may be indicated:

Special shoes, including those with good ankle support

Ankle/foot orthoses (AFO) to correct foot drop and aid walking

Orthopedic surgery to correct severe pes cavus deformity [Guyton & Mann 2000]

Forearm crutches or canes for gait stability; fewer than 5% need wheelchairs.

Treatment of sleep apnea or restless legs [Aboussouan et al 2007]

Exercise within the individual's capability. In a systematic review of all reports of exercise for CMT, Sman et al [2015] identified the following significant improvements following exercise: strength, functional activities, and physiologic adaptations. The optimal exercise modality and intensity for people with CMT as well as the long-term safety of exercise remain unclear.

Pain and depression should be treated symptomatically [Gemignani et al 2004, Padua et al 2006].
