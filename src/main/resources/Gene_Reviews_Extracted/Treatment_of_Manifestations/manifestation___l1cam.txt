Optimal management involves a multidisciplinary team with expertise in pediatrics, child neurology, neurosurgery, rehabilitation, and medical genetics.

Hydrocephalus. Surgical treatment should be performed as needed. Shunting of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is indicated to reduce intracranial pressure. Of note, prenatal shunting procedures offer no advantage [Pinckert & Golbus 1988].

Intellectual disability. Developmental progress should be monitored and stimulated. Developmental outcome is variable and individual educational programming is important.

Adducted thumbs. Surgical intervention is not generally indicated. . A splint may help reduce the degree of adduction. In some milder cases, tendon transfer may improve thumb function.

Spastic paraplegia. Neurologic features should be monitored. Follow up and treatment is nonspecific; general guidelines can be followed.
