Individuals with a cleft lip and/or palate should be evaluated and treated by a multidisciplinary team of specialists. The American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association [2009] has published parameters for evaluation and treatment of patients with cleft lip/palate or other craniofacial anomalies that can guide treatment of these patients.

Management is supportive/symptomatic.

Cleft lip. Management is surgical, dental, and orthodontic.

Cleft palate. In addition to surgery, dentistry, and orthodontics, speech therapy and audiologic evaluation are usually needed. Otolaryngology evaluation is needed for management of middle ear effusions.

Lip pits. Surgery may be indicated for cosmetic purposes or for lip function. The lip pits may be connected to mucous-secreting glands and may be excised for this.

Eyelid and oral synechiae (ankyloblepharon and syngnathia, respectively) may require surgical excision.

Syngnathia often requires emergent release due to feeding and respiratory concerns and may require tracheotomy.

Popliteal pterygium. Management involves physical therapy and surgical and orthopedic intervention, as necessary.

Syndactyly may require surgery.

Abnormal genitalia may require surgery especially in the presence of cryptorchidism. The genital anomalies may result in infertility.
