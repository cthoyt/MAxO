Women with LFS who develop breast cancer are encouraged to consider bilateral mastectomies (rather than lumpectomies) in order to reduce risks of developing a second primary breast tumor and avoid exposure to radiation therapy. However, most experts recommend that treatment efficacy be prioritized above concerns about late effects after careful analysis of risks and benefits. Aside from avoiding radiation therapy, LFS-related tumors are treated according to standard protocols.
