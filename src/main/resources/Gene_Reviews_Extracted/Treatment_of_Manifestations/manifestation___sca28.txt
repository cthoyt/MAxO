Home adaptations including grab bars for the bathtub or shower chairs and raised toilet seats as needed

Speech/language therapy for dysarthria and swallowing difficulties

Physical therapy to ameliorate coordination difficulties, especially with tasks such as eating, dressing, walking, and bathing
