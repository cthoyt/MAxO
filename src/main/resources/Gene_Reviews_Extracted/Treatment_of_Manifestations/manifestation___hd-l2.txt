Treatment is symptomatic and based on the treatment for HD and other neurodegenerative disorders.

Pharmacologic agents may suppress abnormal movements. The most common choices are low-dose neuroleptic agents, such as fluphenazine or haloperidol.

Tremor in one individual was suppressed with clonazepam. However, clonazepam, levodopa/carbidopa, anticholinergics, and typical and atypical neuroleptics were not found helpful in treating the abnormal movements of other affected individuals.

Based on experience with Huntington disease, antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers (lithium, valproic acid, carbamazepine, and lamotragine), and occasionally stimulants may be effective in treating the psychiatric manifestations of HDL2.

In the only report specifically related to HDL2, depression partially responded to sertaline in one individual and to nortriptyline in another individual [Walker et al 2003b].

The affected individual, other family members, and care providers should be educated regarding the likely course of the disease. Assurance that cognitive decline, depression, apathy, and irritability are manifestations of the disease rather than the "fault" of the individual can decrease stress and guilt.

Environmental interventions (establishing regular schedules, easing of expectations to maintain the family finances, encouraging the use of lists to assist with memory) may help.

Families often need help in obtaining social services (see Resources).
