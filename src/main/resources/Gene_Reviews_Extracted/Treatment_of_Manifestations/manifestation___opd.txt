Deafness is managed with hearing aids (see Deafness and Hereditary Hearing Loss Overview). The conductive hearing loss can be caused by fused and misshapen ossicles; attempts to separate the ossicles are usually unsuccessful and can lead to formation of a perilymphatic gusher.

Stridor in the neonatal period on account of laryngeal stenosis rarely requires surgical intervention and is non-progressive with growth.

Cosmetic surgery to correct the fronto-orbital deformity has been attempted in some individuals. Re-growth post surgery does not seem to occur [Kung & Sloan 1998]. Hand and foot malformations may also require surgery.

Orthopedic surgery

Surgical correction of limb bowing has not been reported.

Several individuals have had scoliosis surgically addressed, with satisfactory results.

Chest expansion surgery has been attempted in several individuals with Melnick-Needles syndrome, with only marginal clinical benefit.

Apnea prevention. Micrognathia and tracheobronchomalacia in severely affected individuals can lead to airway collapse and sleep apnea that have been successfully corrected with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) [Lan et al 2006] and mandibular distraction in the most severe instances of MNS.
