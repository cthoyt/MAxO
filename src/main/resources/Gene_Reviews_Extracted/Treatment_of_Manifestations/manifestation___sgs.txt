Management of SGS is best conducted through the coordinated input of a multidisciplinary team of specialists including a clinical geneticist, cardiologist, ophthalmologist, orthopedist, cardiothoracic surgeon, and craniofacial team.

The following are appropriate:

Cardiovascular

If aortic dilatation is present, treatment with beta-adrenergic blockers or other medications should be considered in order to reduce hemodynamic stress.

Surgical intervention for aneurysms may be indicated.

Hernia

Surgical repair of abdominal hernias may be indicated.

Craniofacial

Cleft palate and craniosynostosis require management by a craniofacial team; treatment is the same as in all disorders with these manifestations.

Skeletal

Surgical fixation of cervical spine instability may be necessary.

Clubfoot deformity may require surgical correction.

Pectus excavatum may be severe; rarely, surgical correction is indicated for medical reasons.

Physiotherapy

Physiotherapy may help increase mobility in individuals with joint contractures.

Special education

A developmental assessment will help with placement in a special education center or in a special education program in a regular school.
