Retinal avascularity per se often requires no treatment; however, it can induce ischemia, leading to neovascularization of the retinal periphery, which can be treated with prophylactic cryotherapy or argon laser photocoagulation to attempt to induce regression of the new vessels. Similar treatments are used to treat retinal holes and areas of retinal exudate to prevent retinal detachment.

Rhegmatogenous retinal detachments produced by retinal traction are repaired surgically using conventional methods, but the prognosis is guarded.

Exudative retinal detachments may be stabilized with cryotherapy, but the prognosis is poor.
