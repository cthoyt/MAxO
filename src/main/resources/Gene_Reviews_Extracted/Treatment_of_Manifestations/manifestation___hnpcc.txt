Management of colon cancer in a person with Lynch syndrome. If colon cancer is detected, full colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis is recommended rather than a segmental/partial colonic resection because of the high risk for metachronous cancers [Lynch et al 1988, Aarnio et al 1995, Church & Simmang 2003]. A study of 296 individuals (253 with partial resection, 43 with colectomy anastomosis) from families meeting Amsterdam Criteria found that with a median follow up of 104 months, 22% of affected individuals treated with a partial resection developed a high-risk adenoma and 25% developed a second primary colon cancer, while only 11% and 8% of affected individuals developed adenomas and colon cancers respectively [Kalady et al 2010]. Note: Because the diagnosis of Lynch syndrome is often not considered until after treatment of an initial cancer, many individuals diagnosed with Lynch syndrome have previously had their cancer treated with a limited colonic resection.

Although timing may be difficult, evaluating the tumor biopsy specimen by MSI and IHC (and, if indicated, the MHL1 promoter methylation status) may help determine the optimal surgical approach. A study suggests that persons with colon cancer are open to being approached about genetic testing at the time of their diagnosis [Porteous et al 2003].

The other tumors seen in Lynch syndrome are managed as in the general population.
