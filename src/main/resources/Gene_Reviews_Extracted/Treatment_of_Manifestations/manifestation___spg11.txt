No specific drug treatment or cures exist for SPG11.

Care by a multidisciplinary team that may include a general practitioner, neurologist, medical geneticist, physiotherapist, physical therapist, social worker, and psychologist should be considered.

Symptomatic treatment to reduce pyramidal hyperactivity in the lower limbs includes the following:

Physiotherapy for stretching of the spastic muscles to prevent contractures

Anti-spastic drugs such as baclofen and tizanidine

Botulin toxin and intrathecal baclofen, which can be considered when oral drugs are ineffective and spasticity is severe and disabling

When sphincter disturbances become a problem, urodynamic evaluation should be performed in order to adapt treatment and monitor follow up. Anticholinergic drugs are indicated for urinary urgency.

Psychiatric manifestations should be treated in accordance with standard practice.
