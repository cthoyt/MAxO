Experience in treating patients with LTBP4-related cutis laxa is very limited. Treatment is largely symptomatic. A reasonable approach to treatment could include the following:

Pulmonary

Symptomatic treatment of pulmonary emphysema with inhaled corticosteroids, atropine, and selective β2-adrenergic bronchodilation

Oxygen supplementation if necessary

Gastrointestinal

Medical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux to reduce discomfort and reactive bronchospasms

Feeding of mother’s milk in infants to maximize passive immunization

Dietary advice, sufficient fluid intake and, if necessary, osmotic laxatives to avoid chronic constipation

Genitourinary

Education on complete bladder emptying when voiding

Antibiotic prophylaxis in case of incomplete voiding and recurrent urinary tract infections

Pelvic floor strengthening by physical therapy may help to prevent prolapse of pelvic organs

Consideration of artificial bladder implantation (performed in 1 patient)

Cardiovascular

Care by a (pediatric) cardiologist with experience in connective tissue pathology

Treatment of clinically relevant pulmonary artery stenosis (preferably by catheterization which is minimally invasive and needs a shorter period of anesthesia)

Medical treatment of pulmonary hypertension (e.g., by sildenafil)

Other

Surgical treatment of congenital diaphragmatic hernia or severe hiatal hernia

Caution in surgical treatment of cutis laxa and inguinal or umbilical hernia, as the risk of recurrence is likely to be high (i.e., similar to that observed in other cutis laxa syndromes) and mechanical ventilation used during the procedure may aggravate pulmonary emphysema

Physical therapy for muscle strength and joint stability

Psychosocial support
