Frequently updated, succinct “emergency” care plans should detail the typical clinical issues (either those already experienced by the patient or those anticipated based on the diagnosis) and the importance of early management (e.g., use of IV glucose as an energy source, monitoring for cardiac rhythm disturbance, and monitoring of rhabdomyolysis), and avoidance of triggers (fasting, long-chain fats, and irritation of the myocardium) [Arnold et al 2009].

Cardiac dysfunction is reversible with early, intensive supportive care (occasionally including extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation) and diet modification. See Prevention of Primary Manifestations.
