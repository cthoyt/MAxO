Care by a multidisciplinary team comprising those with expertise in clinical genetics, gastric surgery, gastroenterology, pathology, and nutrition is recommended [Fitzgerald et al 2010] (see full text and Figure 1 therein).

H. pylori infection (if present) is treated in the standard manner.

The primary curative treatment of gastric cancer is surgical resection. Regardless of the surgical procedure used for the treatment of gastric cancer, the effectiveness of surgical resection is poor if the ultimate goal is increased cure rate: studies have shown that surgery alone is less than satisfactory in the management of early gastric cancer, with cure rates approaching only 40%. The role of adjuvant therapy was indefinite until three large, randomized controlled trials showed the survival benefit of adjuvant therapy over surgery alone [Macdonald et al 2000, Cunningham et al 2006, Sakuramoto et al 2007].

Numerous randomized clinical trials have failed to show consistent survival benefits from adjuvant radiation therapy or chemotherapy alone in the treatment of gastric cancer.
