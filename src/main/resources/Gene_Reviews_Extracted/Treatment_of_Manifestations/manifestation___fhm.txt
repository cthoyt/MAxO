Symptomatic support during an episode of hemiplegic migraine is the only therapy available.

A trial of acetazolamide for individuals with FHM1 or a trial of standard migraine prophylactic drugs (tricyclic antidepressants, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, anti-epileptic medications) for all FHM types may be warranted for frequent attacks. Limited correlation exists between drug response and hemiplegic migraine type.

There are anecdotal reports of therapeutic response to antiepileptic medications including topiramate, lacosamide, levetiracetam, and valproate, along with other medications commonly used for migraine prophylaxis.

Antiepileptic treatment may be necessary for seizures that are prevalent in FHM2 (caused by mutation of ATP1A2).
