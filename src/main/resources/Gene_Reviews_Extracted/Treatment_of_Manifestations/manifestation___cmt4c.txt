Treatment is symptomatic. Affected individuals are often managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes neurologists, physiatrists, orthopedic surgeons, and physical and occupational therapists. See Grandis & Shy [2005] for a discussion of general treatment for CMT.

Treatment of spinal deformities

Physiotherapy helps to preserve flexibility.

If the curvature can be reduced with bracing, either a plaster or a thermo-molded plastic corset can be used.

If bracing and physiotherapy together are not sufficient to correct the scoliosis, surgery can be performed at an early age, even before the end of linear growth (Table 2) [Kessali et al 1997, GabreÃ«ls-Festen et al 1999]. Surgical intervention requires consensus among the family, child (if possible), and attending physicians.

Treatment of foot deformities

Special shoes with good ankle support and/or ankle/foot orthoses (AFOs) to correct foot drop and aid walking

Physiotherapy to preserve flexibility

In approximately 9% of individuals, surgery to correct severe pes cavus deformity (Table 2) [Kessali et al 1997, Guyton & Mann 2000, Colomer et al 2006]

Treatment of pain and cramps

Neuropathic pain can be treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (e.g., pregabalin, gabapentin).

Mechanical pain can generally be managed with a combination of physiotherapy and orthopedic treatment.

Cramps can be controlled with quinine. However, quinine is known to induce tinnitus and reversible high-tone hearing loss.

Other

Some individuals require forearm crutches or canes for gait stability; some need wheelchairs.

Exercise to help the individual remain physically active according to his/her abilities is encouraged.
