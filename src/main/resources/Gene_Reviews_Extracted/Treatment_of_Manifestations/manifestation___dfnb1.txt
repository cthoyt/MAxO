The following are indicated:

Fitting with appropriate hearing aids

Enrollment in an appropriate educational program for the hearing impaired

Consideration of cochlear implantation (CI), an excellent habilitation option for persons with profound deafness

Recognition that, unlike with many clinical conditions, the management and treatment of severe-to-profound congenital deafness falls largely within the purview of the social welfare and educational systems rather than the medical care system [Smith et al 2005]

Also see Hereditary Hearing Loss and Deafness for more detailed discussion of management issues.
