Parents seem best able to deal with this severe disorder when accurate information regarding the prognosis is given as soon as possible after the diagnosis is recognized. For those with severe lissencephaly, it is usually appropriate to discuss limitations of care, such as "do not resuscitate" (DNR) orders, in the event of severe illnesses.

Poor feeding in newborns is usually managed by nasogastric tube feedings, as the feeding problems often improve during the first weeks of life. But they often worsen again with intercurrent illnesses and with advancing age and size. At least 50% of children with LIS1-related lissencephaly (but not SBH) eventually have a gastrostomy tube placed for feeding.

A large majority of children with lissencephaly have seizures, including frequent infantile spasms, which can be difficult to control. Management of seizures in children with ILS or SBH is based on the specific seizure type and frequency. In general, seizures should be treated promptly and aggressively by specialists, as poor seizure control frequently results in decline in function and health. Specifically, poor seizure control worsens feeding and increases the likelihood that a gastrostomy tube will be needed, and increases the risk for pneumonia.
