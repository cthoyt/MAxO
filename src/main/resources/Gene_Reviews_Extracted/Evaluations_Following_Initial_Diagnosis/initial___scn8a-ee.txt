To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with a SCN8A-related encephalopathy with epilepsy, the following evaluations are recommended:

Neurologic examination including:

EEG, which may provide an assessment of the overall degree of epileptic encephalopathy and seizure type

Brain MRI if not previously performed

Cognitive and behavioral neuropsychological evaluation

ECG to assess for cardiac arrhythmias, which have been identified in some patients with mutation of genes encoding other sodium channel subunits and may increase the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP)

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
