To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with a branchiootorenal spectrum disorder (BOR/BOS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Second branchial arch anomalies. Cervical examination for fistulae; computed tomography of the neck if a mass is palpable under the sternocleidomastoid muscle above the level of the hyoid bone

Otologic findings

A complete assessment of auditory acuity using ABR, emission testing, and pure tone audiometry (see Deafness and Hereditary Hearing Loss Overview)

Computed tomography of the temporal bones, especially if the hearing impairment fluctuates or is progressive

Renal anomalies. Renal ultrasound examination and/or excretory urography (intravenous pyelography); tests of renal function: BUN and creatinine; urinanalysis

Other. Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
