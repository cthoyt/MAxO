To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 4J (CMT4J), the following evaluations are recommended:

Pulmonary function tests to determine whether respiratory functions are compromised

Skeletal survey to determine if any of the skeletal abnormalities typically observed in Yunis-Var√≥n syndrome (YVS) are evident. Non-neural deficits are often severe and overshadow neurologic symptoms. Thus far, no neuromuscular involvement has been identified in persons with YVS.

Medical genetics consultation
