To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with GRN-related frontotemporal dementia (FTD-GRN), the following evaluations are recommended:

Detailed general, neurologic, and family history

Physical, neurologic, and cognitive examination

Medical genetics consultation

When clinical cognitive assessments are not informative enough, a neuropsychological assessment may be performed to provide a more comprehensive and objective view of a patient's cognitive function. Formal neuropsychological assessment requires comparison of the patient's raw score on a specific test to a large general population normative sample which is usually drawn from a population comparable to the person being examined. This allows for the patient's performance to be compared to a suitable control group, adjusted for age, gender, level of education, and/or ethnicity. While much more sensitive than bedside clinical cognitive examination, such assessment is resource intensive and time consuming.
