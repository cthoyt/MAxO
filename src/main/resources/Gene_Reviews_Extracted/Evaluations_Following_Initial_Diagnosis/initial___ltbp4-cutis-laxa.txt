To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with LTBP4-related cutis laxa, the following evaluations are recommended:

Assessment of lung function, including oxygen saturation, spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusion capacity

Chest x-ray or high-resolution CT scan

Ultrasound examination of the genitourinary tract

Bladder ultrasound examination to diagnose multiple bladder diverticula

Echocardiography

Physiotherapeutic evaluation (hypotonia, hyperlaxity)

Consultation with a medical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

On clinical indication:

Bronchoscopy

Visualization of the gastrointestinal tract by gastrographin ingestion or enema

Pulmonary vessel angiogram

If necessary, bladder ultrasound can be complemented with a voiding cystoureterogram. Due to the potential presence of urethral diverticula, catheterization should be done carefully. Intravenous pyelogram may be an alternative.
