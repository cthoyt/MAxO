To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, the following evaluations are recommended:

Baseline endoscopy to look for macroscopic tumor [Fitzgerald et al 2010]

Evaluation of CDH1 heterozygotes for H. pylori infection given its ability to induce promoter hypermethylation of CDH1 and its role in GC carcinogenesis

Breast examination/mammography in females

Clinical genetics consultation
