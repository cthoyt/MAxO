To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with early-onset familial Alzheimer disease (EOFAD), the following evaluations are recommended:

History (especially first symptoms, duration, progression). In particular, onset before age 45 years may indicate more rapid progression.

Examination (especially mental status)

MRI, PET. Severe cortical atrophy on MRI or marked metabolic deficits on PET imaging suggest more advanced disease.
