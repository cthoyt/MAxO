To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), the following evaluations are recommended:

Skeletal survey to determine the involvement of the spine and degree and extent of joint involvement

Ophthalmologic examination with measurement of visual acuity and intraocular pressure, slit lamp examination of the cornea, and assessment of retinal function by electroretinography and visual field testing

Cardiac evaluation with echocardiography to assess ventricular size and function

Hearing assessment

ENT assessment and consideration of ventilating tubes for recurrent otitis media

Consideration of sleep study

Cranial imaging, preferentially MRI, including assessment of possible hydrocephalus

Assessment of spinal cord and peripheral nerve involvement

Developmental assessment

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
