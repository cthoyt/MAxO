To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with epidermolysis bullosa with pyloric atresia (EB-PA), the following evaluations are recommended, if they were not performed as part of the evaluation that led to the diagnosis:

Evaluation of the sites of blister formation including skin and oral mucosa

Tests of renal function including BUN, creatinine, and urinalysis

Renal ultrasound

Delineation of involvement of the whole esophagus (with concentration on the upper cervical portion) by barium swallow as needed. Endoscopy can be traumatic and should be avoided if possible.

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
