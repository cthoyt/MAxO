To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with Huntington disease-like 2 (HDL2), the following evaluations are recommended:

Neuroimaging studies to exclude other lesions, such as subdural hematomas secondary to falls, which may be contributing to signs or symptoms

Standardized rating instruments, such as the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) or Quantitated Neurological Examination (QNE) for motor abnormalities and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for cognition

Genetics consultation
