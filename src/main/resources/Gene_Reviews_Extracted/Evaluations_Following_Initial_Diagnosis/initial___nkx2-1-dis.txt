To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with an NKX2-1-related disorder, the following evaluations are recommended:

For benign hereditary chorea*

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

For brain-lung-thyroid syndrome (choreoathetosis*, congenital hypothyroidism, and neonatal respiratory distress)

Lung

Pulmonary function testing, if not performed at the time of diagnosis

Pulmonary consultation for further evaluation and treatment of pulmonary dysfunction

Screening for pulmonary malignancy with chest x-ray or CT scan of the chest

Thyroid

Thyroid function testing (TSH, T3, T4) for evaluation of possible hypothyroidism, if not performed at the time of diagnosis

Endocrinology consultation for further evaluation and treatment of thyroid abnormalities

Consider evaluation for thyroid malignancy by physical examination that includes thyroid palpation.

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

*Note that brain MRI is typically obtained as part of the diagnostic evaluation.
