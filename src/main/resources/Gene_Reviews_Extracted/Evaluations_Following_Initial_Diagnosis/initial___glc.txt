To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with primary congenital glaucoma (PCG), examination under anesthesia or sedation is warranted to make a complete assessment of both eyes. The examination includes the following:

Measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP) within the first few minutes of anesthesia

Measurement of corneal diameter

Examination of the anterior segment

Direct gonioscopy to rule out secondary glaucoma

Dilated fundus examination to evaluate for optic nerve damage

If the cornea is opaque, ultrasound biomicroscopy or optical coherence tomography to aid in evaluating the anterior segment structures

Measurement of axial length

If the child is examined under anesthesia, consent may be obtained to perform the appropriate surgical procedure after evaluation under anesthesia.

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor is recommended.
