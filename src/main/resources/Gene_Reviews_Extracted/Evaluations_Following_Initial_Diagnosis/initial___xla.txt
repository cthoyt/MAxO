To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), the following evaluations are recommended:

A complete blood count with differential

Chemistries that include renal and liver function tests, total protein, albumin, and CRP

Quantitative serum immunoglobulins and titers to vaccine antigens as baseline measurements prior to initiation of gammaglobulin substitution therapy

Baseline chest and sinus x-rays

If the patient is able to cooperate, base line pulmonary function tests

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
