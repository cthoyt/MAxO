To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with lateral meningocele syndrome (LMS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Spine MRI to assess for meningoceles (if not performed at time of diagnosis) and neurosurgical assessment to evaluate the effect of lateral spinal meningocele size and location on neurologic function

Brain MRI to assess for Chiari I malformation or hydrocephalus, if not performed at time of diagnosis

Thorough physical and neurologic examination for signs of neuropathy, joint abnormalities, and abdominal hernias

Neurocognitive assessment

Assessment by general surgery for abdominal hernia repair

Assessment by orthopedic surgery for symptomatic skeletal deformities.

Visualization of the aortic arch by echocardiogram or MRI

Urologic assessment for cryptorchidism if present

Feeding assessment

Hearing assessment

Ophthalmologic assessment

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
