To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Refsum disease, the following evaluations are recommended:

Ophthalmology. Examination for retinitis pigmentosa/miosis, cataract, and visual fields [Claridge et al 1992]

Anosmia testing using the procedure described by Gibberd et al [2004]

Neurology. Ataxia, neuropathy, myography, and electrophysiologic assessment

Audiology. Pure tone audiometry and possibly otoacoustic emission testing and auditory brain stem evoked response (ABER) testing if hearing difficulties are suspected but not identified on pure tone audiometry [Bamiou et al 2003]

Radiology. Physical examination of hands, feet, and knees; radiologic assessment of hands and feet

Cardiology. Cardiac evaluation including electrocardiography (ECG) and cardiac ultrasound examination

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
