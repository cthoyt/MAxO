To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with hemophilia A, the following evaluations are recommended if they have not already been completed:

A personal and family history of bleeding to help predict disease severity

A joint and muscle evaluation, particularly if the individual describes a history of hemarthrosis or deep-muscle hematomas

Screening for hepatitis A, B, and C as well as HIV if blood products or plasma-derived clotting factor concentrates were administered prior to 1990

Baseline CBC with a platelet count, especially if there is a history of nose bleeds, GI bleeding, mouth bleeding, or (in females) menorrhagia or postpartum hemorrhage

Referral to a hemophilia treatment center. For locations:

Worldwide, see World Federation of HÃ¦mophilia;

US only, see National Hemophilia Foundation.

Identification of the specific F8 pathogenic variant in an individual to aid in determining disease severity, the likelihood of inhibitor development, and the chance that immune tolerance will be successful if an inhibitor does develop

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor, particularly for a new diagnosis in the family and for females of childbearing years
