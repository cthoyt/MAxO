An important subset of individuals with HCM are at increased risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD) and may benefit from an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Further evaluation to assess for the presence or absence of risk predictors associated with SCD is a standard part of patient management.

SCD risk factors include:

Personal history of ventricular fibrillation (VF), aborted/resuscitated sudden death / cardiac arrest, or sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT)

Family history of SCD

Extreme LVH (>30mm)

Hypotensive blood pressure response to exercise

Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) on ambulatory monitoring

Unexplained syncope

Risk factor information, obtained from the medical history, family history, and cardiovascular testing, includes:

Echocardiogram to measure the degree of LVH;

Exercise testing to assess blood pressure response to exercise;

Ambulatory monitoring for significant ventricular ectopy.

Accurate risk assessment is difficult because the positive predictive value of any single parameter – other than prior cardiac arrest or sustained VT – is relatively low. The presence of two or more risk factors has been associated with an increased risk for sudden cardiac death [Elliott et al 2000, Dimitrow et al 2010], although implantation of a primary prevention ICD may be appropriate in the presence of a single compelling risk factor. Conversely, the absence of any risk factors places an individual in a low-risk category [Maron et al 2003b], although 3%-5% of persons with SCD do not have a standard risk factor.

Guidelines [Garratt et al 2010, Gersh et al 2011]* recommend that implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy:

Be used for all patients with a history of sustained VT and/or VF (see Treatment of Manifestations) as secondary prevention;

Be considered for primary prevention in patients with two or more risk factors; or selected patients with a single risk factor (see Prevention of Primary Manifestations);

Currently ICD implantation is the only effective treatment to prevent SCD, but it is associated with cumulative morbidity.
