To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with primary hyperoxaluria type 3 (PH3), the following evaluations are recommended:

Kidney imaging for assessment of number and location of stones and presence of nephrocalcinosis

Measurement of plasma oxalate concentration to assess the degree of oxalate overproduction

Baseline 24-hour collection with measurement of oxalate, calcium, citrate, pH, urine volume, and other components of a supersaturation profile to identify specific risk factors for stones â€“ information that is valuable in guiding treatment

Assessment of kidney function by serum creatinine and eGFR

If chronic kidney disease (CKD) is present, evaluation for signs of systemic oxalosis by physical examination (livedo reticularis or non-healing ulcers of the skin), echocardiography (oxalate cardiomyopathy), electrocardiogram (conduction disturbances), complete blood count (erythropoietin-resistant anemia), bone films (sclerosis, pathologic fractures due to oxalate osteodystrophy), and retinal examination (retinal oxalate deposits)

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
