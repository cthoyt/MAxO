Complete history and physical examination with particular attention to range of motion in the spine and large joints

Physical medicine and rehabilitation evaluation if limited range of motion or joint pain occurs

Electrocardiogram and echocardiogram in individuals older than age 40 years

Renal ultrasound examination or helical abdominal CT to evaluate for the presence of renal calculi

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
