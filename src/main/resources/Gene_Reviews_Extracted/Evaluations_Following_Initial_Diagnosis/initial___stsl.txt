To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with sitosterolemia, the following evaluations are recommended:

Measurement of plasma concentrations of plant sterols (primarily beta-sitosterol and campesterol) and cholesterol, if not measured at the time of diagnosis

Determination of the size, number, and distribution of xanthomas (tendon and tuberous)

Depending on the age of the patient, cardiology consultation to evaluate for atherosclerosis and cardiac valve abnormalities with consideration of coronary arteriography as needed

Complete blood count with smear to look for platelet abnormalities and/or thrombocytopenia

Evaluation for possible hemolysis/ hemolytic anemia

Monitoring liver function (e.g., albumin, ALT, AST, ALP, bilirubin) [Miettinen et al 2006]

Evaluation for arthralgias and/or arthritis

If splenomegaly is significant, consultation with a hematologist and gastroenterologist
