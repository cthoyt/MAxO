To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with HFE-associated hereditary hemochromatosis (HFE-HH), the following evaluations are recommended at initial diagnosis:

Serum ferritin concentration to establish disease status and prognosis (see Figure 2)

For p.Cys282Tyr homozygotes:

Liver biopsy remains the gold standard for establishing or excluding cirrhosis.

Liver biopsy is recommended for those with serum ferritin >1,000 ng/mL or elevated AST and ALT to evaluate for advanced hepatic fibrosis [Morrison et al 2003, Bacon et al 2011].

Liver biopsy is not recommended for those with serum ferritin concentration <1,000 ng/mL and normal ALT and AST because their risk for advanced hepatic fibrosis is low [Bacon et al 2011].

MRI to estimate parenchymal iron content by utilizing the paramagnetic properties of iron:

A specialized MRI technique with excellent sensitivity for estimation of hepatic iron concentration was approved by the FDA for clinical use [St Pierre et al 2005]. This method of quantitative MRI accurately measures liver iron within a sufficiently wide liver iron concentration range. Compared with liver biopsy, MRI-R2 is noninvasive and significantly reduces biopsy sampling error [Fischer & Harmatz 2009]. In addition, T2* MRI measurement of liver iron is now widely available [Brittenham et al 2003, Cheong et al 2005, Ptaszek et al 2005].

Cardiac iron concentration can also be monitored using similar techniques and may be of prognostic value [Fischer & Harmatz 2009, Ramazzotti et al 2009].

Biomagnetic liver susceptometry (BLS) to estimate liver iron by measuring the change in magnetic flux as a hemochromatosis patient moves through a stable magnetic field, generating a voltage in the SQUID sensor [Fischer & Harmatz 2009]. As BLS is not widely available it is not included in diagnosis or management guidelines for hemochromatosis.
