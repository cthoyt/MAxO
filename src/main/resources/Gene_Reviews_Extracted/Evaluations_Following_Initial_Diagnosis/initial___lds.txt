To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended:

Referral to an ophthalmologist (preferably one familiar with distichiasis) for slit-lamp examination, as the extra lashes may be subtle and easily missed on clinical examination

Physical examination to document the presence of manifestations and identify evidence of cellulitis

Isotope lymphoscintigraphy to confirm underlying abnormality of the lymphatics as the cause of the edema

Physical examination of the heart and possible echocardiography if murmur or arrhythmia is identified

Medical genetics consultation
