To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with X-linked Opitz G/BBB syndrome, the following evaluations by a multidisciplinary team (including craniofacial surgeon, ophthalmologist, pediatrician, pediatric urologist, cardiologist, pulmonologist, speech pathologist, and clinical geneticist) are recommended:

Past medical history and physical examination with attention to head and facial measurements, palate, heart, genitourinary system, and lower respiratory system

Complete eye evaluation including assessment of visual acuity, refractive error, and ocular alignment for possible strabismus

Assessment of hypospadias by a urologist, including ultrasound examination to evaluate for renal/urinary tract abnormalities in males with severe hypospadias

Laryngoscopy and chest x-ray in individuals who have choking with feeding, recurrent pneumonia, and/or aspiration

Assessment of cleft lip/palate (CLP) by a craniofacial surgeon

Age-appropriate assessment of development and intellectual abilities

Assessment of anal position and patency

Echocardiogram
