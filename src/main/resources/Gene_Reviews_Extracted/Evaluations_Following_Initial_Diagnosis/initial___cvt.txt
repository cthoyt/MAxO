To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), the following evaluations are recommended:

Resting ECG

Holter monitoring, as arrhythmias develop when heart rate increases

Exercise stress test both for diagnosis and monitoring of therapy

Echocardiogram and/or MRI to evaluate for structural defects

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
