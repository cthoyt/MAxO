To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES), the following evaluations are recommended:

Examination by a (pediatric) ophthalmologist for visual acuity, refractive error, extraocular movement, strabismus, size of palpebral apertures, and eyelid elevation. Those with amblyopia or strabismus should be referred to a pediatric ophthalmologist for management [Beckingsale et al 2003].

Genetic evaluation and genetic counseling by a clinical geneticist to discuss recurrence risk and assess risk for premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). In girls with BPES, the family history can indicate the type of BPES in affected females (with type I inferred by the association with subfertility or infertility). In uninformative families or simplex cases (i.e., single occurrence in a family), molecular genetic testing may be helpful in some cases in assessing the risk for POI.

Referral of females with BPES to a pediatric or adult endocrinologist during late puberty or early adulthood to assess onset and course of POI
