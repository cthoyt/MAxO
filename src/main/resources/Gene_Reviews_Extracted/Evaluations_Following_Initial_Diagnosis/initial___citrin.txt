To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with a phenotype of citrin deficiency, the following are recommended:

NICCD

Assess the size of the liver and spleen.

Seek evidence of fatty liver by abdominal US, CT, or MRI.

Investigate feeding pattern.

FTTDCD

Perform detailed anthropometric examination and evaluation using age- and gender-matched growth standards.

Investigate feeding pattern.

CTLN2. Investigate carbohydrate, protein, and lipid composition of the diet.

All phenotypes. Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor is indicated.
