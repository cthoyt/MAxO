To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD), the following evaluations are recommended:

ECG, Holter-ECG monitoring, echocardiography, radionucleotide angiography, and cardiac MRI

Note: Electrophysiologic study is often advisable in EDMD; however, it is performed in selected individuals on the basis of the clinical presentation and the results of noninvasive studies and not as an "evaluation at initial diagnosis" in all individuals.

Evaluation of respiratory function (vital capacity measurement and other pulmonary volume measurements)

Evaluation of joints by a physical therapist or orthopedist to determine need for therapies (physiotherapy, mechanical aids, orthopedic surgeries)

For LMNA-linked EDMD: evaluation of metabolic functions (glycemia, insulinemia, trigylceridemia). Rarely, an individual with LMNA-linked EDMD has had an overlapping LMNA phenotype and additional partial lipodystrophy features, thus requiring a careful metabolic assessment [Garg et al 2002, van der Kooi et al 2002].

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
