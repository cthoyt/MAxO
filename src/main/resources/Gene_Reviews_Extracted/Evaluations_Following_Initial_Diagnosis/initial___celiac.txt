To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with celiac disease, the following evaluations are recommended:

Small-bowel biopsy in those who are well established on a gluten-containing diet to assess the degree of villous atrophy (Table 1). However, the degree of villous atrophy does not correlate with the severity of the clinical findings.

Baseline bone-density test in adults to evaluate for osteoporosis/osteopenia. In those with osteoporosis, vitamin D and parathyroid hormone concentrations should be evaluated [Green & Jabri 2003].

Screening tests for anemia, abnormal liver function, and nutrient deficiencies (iron, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B12, folic acid)

Evaluation for a coexisting malignancy or autoimmune disease in symptomatic and/or elderly individuals [Alaedini & Green 2005, Pietzak 2005]
