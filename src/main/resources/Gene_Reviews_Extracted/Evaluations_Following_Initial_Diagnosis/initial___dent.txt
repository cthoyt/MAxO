To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with Dent disease, the following evaluations are recommended:

Assessment of renal function (measured or estimated GFR; urine protein excretion)

Assessment for nephrocalcinosis and kidney stones by imaging studies

For those with evidence of renal stones or nephrocalcinosis: urine studies for kidney stone risk factors (including calcium and citrate excretion)

Assessment of risk for bone disease (serum calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase)

Note: Elevated alkaline phosphatase has been reported in all individuals with clinical rickets [Wrong et al 1994].

For those with evidence of bone disease and/or growth delay: more complete assessment of bone health (i.e., serum vitamin D concentration and parathyroid hormone [PTH] level; x-rays of long bones for evidence of osteomalacia)

In children, evaluation of stature using standard growth charts

Clinical genetics consultation
