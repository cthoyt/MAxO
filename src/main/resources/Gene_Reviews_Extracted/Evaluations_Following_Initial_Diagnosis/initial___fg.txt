Measurement of height, weight, and head circumference

Developmental and behavioral assessment

Neurologic history and examination for evidence of seizures and hypotonia

Evaluation for evidence of spasticity in individuals with FGS1

Consideration of brain imaging studies in individuals with FGS1 and LS

Ophthalmologic evaluation for strabismus, visual deficits, and other ophthalmologic features

Examination for evidence of anal anomalies in individuals with FGS1

Examination for evidence of genitourinary anomalies

Cardiology evaluation with echocardiogram

Audiology evaluation in individuals with XLOS

Dental evaluation to evaluate for dental anomalies in individuals with XLOS and LS

Consultation with a clinical geneticist
