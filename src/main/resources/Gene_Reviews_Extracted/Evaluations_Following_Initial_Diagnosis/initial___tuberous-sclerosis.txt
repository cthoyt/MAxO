To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), the following evaluations are recommended by the International Tuberous Sclerosis Consensus Conference [Northrup et al 2013] (full text):

Medical history and physical examination, especially for features of TSC, including:

Detailed dermatologic inspection/exam

Detailed clinical dental inspection/exam

Screening for hypertension by obtaining an accurate blood pressure measurement

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, if not completed already, to assess for the presence of tubers, subependymal nodules (SENs), migrational defects, and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma

Baseline routine electroencephalogram (EEG)

If abnormal, especially if features of TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorder (TAND) are also present, follow up with a 24-hour video EEG to assess for subclinical seizure activity

During infancy, educate parents to recognize infantile spasms, even if none have occurred at the time of first diagnosis.

Evaluation for TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorder (TAND)

Complete ophthalmologic evaluation, including dilated funduscopy, to assess for retinal lesions and visual field defects

Echocardiogram in the pediatric age group (especially if age <3 years), if one has not been performed already

Electrocardiogram (ECG) in all ages to assess for underlying conduction defects

Baseline pulmonary function testing (pulmonary function testing and 6-minute walk test) and high-resolution chest computed tomography (HRCT), even if asymptomatic, in individuals at risk of developing LAM (typically females age â‰¥18 years). Adult males, if symptomatic, should also undergo pulmonary function testing.

MRI of abdomen to assess for presence of angiomyolipoma and renal cysts

Evaluation of renal function by obtaining a serum creatinine level to determine the glomerular filtration rate (GFR)

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
