To establish the extent of disease in a child diagnosed with holoprosencephaly (HPE), evaluation for the following is recommended at a minimum (other organ systems may also be investigated depending on specific clinical findings):

Cleft lip and/or palate

Hydrocephalus and/or features of HPE or other cortical anomalies. All children with midline facial anomalies should undergo brain MRI; attention should also be paid to the pituitary region, which often requires high-resolution thin sections.

Growth deficiency. Height, weight, and head circumference should be measured. It is important to compare weight to height in addition to plotting absolute measurements. Evaluation should include thyroid function tests, bone age, complete blood count, blood chemistries, sedimentation rate, insulin-like growth factor 1, and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3. If growth hormone deficiency is found, panhypopituitarism should be assessed by specific hormone testing and brain MRI.

Pituitary dysfunction. Sagittal MRI can be used to determine pituitary absence or ectopia and anatomic information. CNS anomalies and absent corpus callosum and/or septum pellucidum may accompany endocrine dysfunction. Serum analysis for specific hormones can be performed to evaluate pituitary function.

Oral feeding and swallowing. Evaluation should include assessment of caloric intake, swallowing abilities, oral motor skills, and presence of gastroesophageal reflux. Occupational and speech evaluations are warranted to evaluate and address feeding concerns. Studies for diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux including esophageal pH probe, milk scan, barium swallow, and/or endoscopy may be considered.
