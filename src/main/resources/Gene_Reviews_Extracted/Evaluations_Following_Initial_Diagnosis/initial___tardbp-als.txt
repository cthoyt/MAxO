To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with TARDBP-related ALS (or any other form of ALS), the following evaluations are recommended:

EMG/NCS to document the regions of involvement

Pulmonary function testing to detect and stage respiratory involvement

Speech and swallowing evaluation if dysarthria and/or dysphagia are present, to direct care to minimize risk of aspiration and to initiate augmentative communication strategies for possible loss of verbal communication

Physical and occupational therapy evaluation to determine what adaptive devices are needed to maximize function

Nutritional evaluation

Screening for depression and need for psychosocial support

Clinical genetics consultation
