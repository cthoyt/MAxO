To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with the 15q24 microdeletion syndrome, the following evaluations should be considered:

Ophthalmologic examination

Formal audiology evaluation to assess for sensorineural hearing loss

Cardiac evaluation

Brain imaging in individuals with microcephaly and/or neurologic findings

Examination for genitourinary abnormalities (e.g., hypospadias or cryptorchidism in males)

Comprehensive developmental assessment

Consideration of neurologic referral for any unusual movements or concern for seizures

Discussion of results with a clinical geneticist or genetic counselor
