To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with ataxia with vitamin E deficiency (AVED), the following evaluations are recommended:

Clinical neurologic examination â€“ particularly reflex status, vibratory and position sense, gait, Babinski sign, tremor, dysarthria

Ophthalmologic examination for evidence of macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa and decreased visual acuity; electroretinogram (ERG)

Cardiac examination; echocardiography and ECG to assess for cardiomyopathy

Neurophysiologic examination; nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and somatosensory potentials (especially the central conduction time [Schuelke et al 1999]), which are good objective measures of neurologic improvement after vitamin E supplementation

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
