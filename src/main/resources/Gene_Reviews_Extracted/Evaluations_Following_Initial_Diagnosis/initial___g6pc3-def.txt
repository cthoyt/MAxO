To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with G6PC3 deficiency, the following evaluations are recommended:

Full blood count to look for evidence of other hematologic involvement (i.e., intermittent thrombocytopenia and/or lymphopenia)

Immunologic evaluation for T-cell subsets in individuals with a more severe presentation and unusual non-bacterial infections

Consultation with a cardiologist to evaluate for congenital heart disease

Renal and pelvic ultrasound examination to look for urogenital malformations

Growth parameters in children and pubertal development in adolescents

Age appropriate endocrine assessment for evidence of the hormone deficiencies reported (i.e., growth hormone, gonadotropins, thyroid hormone)

Biochemical investigations to look for abnormalities in the lipid profile

Clinical genetics consultation
