To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with urofacial syndrome (UFS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Urinalysis and urine culture for occult or chronic infection

Assessment of renal function: serum creatinine concentration and/or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)

Urinary tract ultrasound examination

Micturating cystourethrogram

Uroflowmetry or urodynamic testing

Blood pressure measurement

Assessment of renal parenchymal damage: as indicated by the individualâ€™s presentation, dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) isotope scan to visualize functional kidney parenchyma [Ochoa 2004, Aydogdu et al 2010, Stuart et al 2013]

Assessment of bowel voiding

Medical genetics consultation
