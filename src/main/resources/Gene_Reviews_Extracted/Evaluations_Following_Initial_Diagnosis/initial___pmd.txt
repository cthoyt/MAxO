To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with PLP1-related disorders, the following evaluations are recommended:

Physical examination to determine extent and severity of respiratory and feeding difficulties, weakness, hypotonia, spasticity, scoliosis, ataxia, visual impairment, cognitive impairment, contractures, joint dislocations, and ambulation

In infants and children, developmental assessment to determine capabilities and needs for cognitive, physical, and other symptomatic therapies

Brain MRI (more helpful age â‰¥9 months) to determine severity of myelination abnormalities; in older children and adults, magnetic resonance spectroscopy to ascertain axonal dysfunction

Assessment of peripheral nerve function using NCV to presumptively identify individuals with the PLP1 null syndrome; probably reliable only after age four years

Family history to identify other affected or at-risk individuals

Clinical genetics consultation
