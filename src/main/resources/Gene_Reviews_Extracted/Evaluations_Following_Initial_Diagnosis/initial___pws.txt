To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with PWS, the following evaluations are recommended:

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Endocrinology consultation

Nutritional consultation

Assessment of newborns and young infants for sucking problems and failure to thrive

Regardless of age, measurement and plotting of height, weight, head circumference and body mass index (BMI) on either age-appropriate growth charts or charts developed for PWS [Butler et al 2011, Butler et al 2015]

Assessment for hypothyroidism in children, especially those with prolonged failure to thrive, those with excess weight gain in the absence of increased food intake, and those with poor linear growth despite growth hormone treatment

Evaluation of respiratory status with a low threshold for performing a sleep study regardless of age. These studies are specifically recommended prior to the initiation of growth hormone therapy (GHT) and four to eight weeks after starting GHT, along with assessment of the size of tonsils and adenoids, particularly in the obese individual.

Assessment of development of infants and of educational development of children including a speech evaluation

Assessment for the presence of behavioral problems and obsessive-compulsive features after age two years, and for psychosis in adolescents and adults. If history reveals evidence of these problems, referral for more detailed assessment is indicated.

Assessment of males for the presence of cryptorchidism regardless of age

Referral for ophthalmologic evaluation if strabismus is present, and for assessment of visual acuity by age one year or at diagnosis if it is later

Regardless of age, assessment for the presence of scoliosis clinically, and, if indicated, radiographically

Note: Very obese individuals cannot be adequately assessed for scoliosis clinically; x-rays are necessary to establish the diagnosis.
