To establish the extent of disease in an infant diagnosed with Treacher Collins syndrome, the following assessments are recommended:

The airway for evidence of choanal atresia/stenosis and/or micrognathia and glossoptosis predisposing to obstruction of the oropharynx

The palate for clefts

Swallowing function

Hearing through formal audiologic examination (see Deafness and Hereditary Hearing Loss Overview)

Ophthalmologic evaluation with attention to extraocular movement, corneal exposure, and visual acuity

If hearing loss is documented during the first six months of life, a craniofacial CT scan (axial and coronal slices) can be performed to document the anatomy of the head and neck and the external auditory canal, middle ear, and inner ear.

Assessment for dental anomalies should be made when teeth have erupted.
