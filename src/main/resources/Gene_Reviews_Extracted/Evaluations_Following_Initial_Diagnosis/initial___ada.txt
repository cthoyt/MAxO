To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency, the following evaluations are recommended, some of which may be performed as part of the diagnostic evaluation:

Identification of specific disease-causing viral, fungal, or bacterial organisms (both normal pathogens and opportunistic agents)

Complete blood count (CBC)

Flow cytometry to quantify lymphocyte subsets (T-, B-, NK-cells)

Assessment of humoral immune function by measuring serum immunoglobulins and the titer of specific antibodies related to infections and immunizations

Evaluation of cellular immune function by in vitro response of blood mononuclear cells to mitogens and antigens

Measurement of erythrocyte dAXP concentration to evaluate metabolic severity

Liver function testing to assess for metabolic hepatitis

Auditory testing

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
