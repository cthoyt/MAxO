To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with complete plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) deficiency, the following evaluations are recommended:

Questions to elicit a patientâ€™s history of:

Epistaxis

Poor wound healing

Bleeding in association with injury or trauma

Bleeding with dental extractions

Additional oral bleeding

Post-surgical bleeding

In females:

Heavy menstrual bleeding

Postpartum bleeding

Bleeding during pregnancy

Preterm delivery

Bleeding in association with ovulation

History of therapies tried in the past and the response to each specific therapy

Note that response to antifibrinolytic therapy supports the diagnosis of complete PAI-1 deficiency (see Treatment of Manifestations).

Evaluation by a hematologist with training in hemostasis

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
