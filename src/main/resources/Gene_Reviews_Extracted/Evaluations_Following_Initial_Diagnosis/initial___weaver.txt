To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with a heterozygous EZH2 pathogenic variant, the following evaluations are recommended:

Developmental assessment

Thorough history to identify clinical features associated with Weaver syndrome

Physical examination with particular attention paid to growth measurements and skeletal findings: camptodactyly (in the newborn period), scoliosis, and pectus deformities. The presence of an abdominal mass warrants immediate investigation.

Consultation with a medical geneticist and/or genetic counselor to identify other family members who could be affected; where possible, measurement of parental heights
