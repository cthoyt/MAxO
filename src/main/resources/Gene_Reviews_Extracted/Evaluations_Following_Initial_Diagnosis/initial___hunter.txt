To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II; also known as Hunter syndrome), the following evaluations are recommended:

Echocardiogram

Pulmonary function testing

Sleep study if sleep apnea is a potential concern

Hearing test

Nerve conduction velocity (NCV) study to assess for carpal tunnel syndrome

Head-cervical MRI and/or opening pressure on lumbar puncture to assess for hydrocephalus and spinal cord compression. Because MRI needs to be performed under sedation and/or intubation in individuals with the early progressive form, there is an increased risk of compromising the upper airway. See Prevention of Secondary Complications.

Eye examination

Developmental assessment

Medical genetics consultation

Note: Many of these assessments are age dependent. For example, pulmonary function and sleep studies would not be appropriate in a two year old.
