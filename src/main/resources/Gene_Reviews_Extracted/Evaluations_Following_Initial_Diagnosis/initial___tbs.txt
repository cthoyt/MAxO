To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Townes-Brocks syndrome (TBS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Hearing. Hearing evaluation as soon as the diagnosis of TBS is suspected (see Deafness and Hereditary Hearing Loss Overview)

Kidneys. Renal ultrasound examination and routine laboratory tests for renal function

Heart. Baseline evaluation by a cardiologist including an echocardiogram

Eyes. Ophthalmology examination to evaluate for ocular features of TBS and atypical finding of Duane anomaly.

Other. Clinical genetics consultation
