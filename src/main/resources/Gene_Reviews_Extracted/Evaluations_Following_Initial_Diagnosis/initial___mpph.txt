To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with megalencephaly-postaxial polydactyly-polymicrogyria-hydrocephalus (MPPH) syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended:

Physical examination with particular attention to head size (OFC)

In the presence of hydrocephalus and/or cerebellar tonsillar ectopia, full spinal MRI to evaluate for syringomyelia or syrinx formation

Assessment by a pediatric neurologist with evaluation of suspected seizures as indicated

Assessment of feeding by a feeding specialist, nutritionist, and gastroenterologist for evidence of chewing and swallowing difficulties and dysphagia

Developmental assessment

Echocardiogram (to evaluate for structural cardiac defects)

Renal ultrasound examination (to evaluate for structural renal defects)

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
