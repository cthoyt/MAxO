To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with hereditary myopathy with early respiratory failure (HMERF), the following evaluations are recommended:

Neuromuscular neurology consultation, ideally at a center with expertise in inherited muscle disease to coordinate specialized testing

Respiratory medicine consultation to assess pulmonary function and coordinate nocturnal ventilator support if required

Physiotherapy consultation to assess lower limb function and general mobility

Occupational therapy consultation to recommend home and/or office adaptations and mobility aids

Social services consultation to assist with workplace adaptations and/or access to social/disability benefits

Clinical genetics consultation to help coordinate genetic investigations and provide genetic counseling consultation
