To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with RRM2B-related mitochondrial disease, the following evaluations are recommended:

Comprehensive clinical examination and neurology consultation that includes measures of functional neurologic status

Formal developmental evaluation (particularly in a child with the encephalomyopathic form with renal tubulopathy)

Formal assessment of vision and hearing

Brain MRI and electroencephalogram (EEG) in individuals with encephalopathy and/or seizures. Note: these may be normal with certain RRM2B-related mitochondrial disease phenotypes.

Nutritional assessment

Speech and language assessment

Physical therapy assessment

Occupational therapy assessment

Pulmonary function testing

For those with Kearns-Sayre syndrome, cardiac evaluation to include electrocardiogram (ECG) and/or echocardiogram
