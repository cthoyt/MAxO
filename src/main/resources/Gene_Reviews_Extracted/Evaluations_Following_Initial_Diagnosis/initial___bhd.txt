To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Birt-Hogg-Dub√© syndrome (BHDS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Detailed dermatologic examination and punch biopsy of suspected cutaneous lesion

High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) or CT of the chest highly recommended for visualization of pulmonary cysts. Individuals who have symptoms/signs of pneumothorax should immediately undergo chest x-ray and CT of the chest and appropriate treatment.

Baseline abdominal/pelvic CT scan with contrast or MRI to screen for renal tumor. Renal ultrasound examination may distinguish cystic from solid renal lesions.

Clinical genetics consultation
