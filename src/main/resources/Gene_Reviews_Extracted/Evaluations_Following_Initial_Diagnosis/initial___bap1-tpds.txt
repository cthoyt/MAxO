To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome (BAP1-TPDS), the following evaluations are recommended [Rai et al 2016]:

Atypical Spitz (ATS) tumors, cutaneous melanoma (CM), and/or basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Full-body skin examination by a dermatologist with excision of any lesions suggestive of an atypical Spitz tumor

Uveal melanoma (UM). Dilated eye examination and imaging by an ocular oncologist

Malignant mesothelioma (MMe). No screening modalities exist; however, if an abdominal MRI is to be performed as recommended for ccRCC, consider evaluation of the peritoneum and pleura as well. Although some physicians recommend spiral chest CT for asymptomatic persons with a history of exposure to asbestos, others do not, given the possible increased risk of cancer from radiation exposure.

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Abdominal ultrasound examination, urinalysis, and abdominal MRI (consider also requesting assessment of the pleura and peritoneum)

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
