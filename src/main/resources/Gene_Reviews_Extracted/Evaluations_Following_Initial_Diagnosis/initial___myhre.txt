To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Myhre syndrome, the following are recommended (if not completed previously as part of the diagnostic evaluation).

Cardiovascular

Upper- and lower-extremity blood pressure measurements

Two-dimensional echocardiography with Doppler

For those with abnormal findings, more extensive imaging if indicated including cardiac catheterization to document the characteristic hemodynamics of restrictive cardiomyopathy

Respiratory

Assessment for airway stenosis by the least invasive means possible with assessment for signs of upper-airway obstruction including noisy breathing, work of breathing, and oxygen saturation

Assessment of pulmonary function and oxygen saturation for evidence of obstructive or restrictive lung disease

Gastrointestinal. Based on clinical indication (by least invasive means possible), evaluate for evidence of stenosis.

Neuropsychiatric. Neuropsychometric evaluation may be indicated for individuals with autistic behaviors and/or cognitive involvement.

Other

Ophthalmology evaluation

Speech evaluation

Audiology evaluation

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
