To establish the extent of muscle involvement in an individual diagnosed with Udd distal myopathy, the following evaluations are recommended:

CT and MRI identify affected muscles with high specificity.

EMG can help identify involved muscles but is much less accurate and less convenient for the affected individual.

Manual muscle force measurement can be used to help identify involved muscles but is even less specific than EMG.
