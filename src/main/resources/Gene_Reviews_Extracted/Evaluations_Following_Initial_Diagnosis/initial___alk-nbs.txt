To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with ALK-related neuroblastic tumor susceptibility, the following evaluations are recommended based on the authorâ€™s personal experience as no guidelines have been established for initial evaluation of individuals diagnosed with a germline ALK pathogenic variant.

Physical examination to assess for clinical manifestations of neuroblastic tumors such as an abdominal mass, Horner syndrome, and/ or cutaneous lesions

Radiograph of the chest radiograph and ultrasound examination of the abdomen, the most common sites for neuroblastic tumor development

Measurement of urine cathecholamines, as homovanillic acid and vanillylmendelic acid may be elevated in the presence of a neuroblastic tumor

Medical genetics consultation
