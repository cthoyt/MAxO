To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with a RASA1-related disorder, the following evaluations are recommended:

Medical history and physical examination with a focus on symptoms and findings secondary to arteriovenous malformations/arteriovenous fistulas (AVMs/AVFs)

Brain imaging â€“if not already performed- to identify AVMs/AVFs (e.g., vein of Galen aneurysms and other intracranial AVMs) to allow early identification of macrofistulas that can be treated prior to the development of symptoms [Revencu et al 2008]

Consideration of spine imaging to identify and characterize AVMs/AVFs. Currently no consensus protocols for radiographic evaluation of individuals with RASA1-related disorders have been developed; therefore, discussion with a radiologist is recommended in order to develop an appropriate plan for imaging based on the patient's age and the capabilities and experience of the imaging facility.

Consideration of further imaging in individuals with evidence of cardiac overload, to look for causative AVMs/AVFs

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
