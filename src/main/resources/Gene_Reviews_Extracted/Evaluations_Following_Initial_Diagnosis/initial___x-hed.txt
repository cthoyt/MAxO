To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED), the following evaluations are recommended:

Initial evaluation of the developing dentition, typically accomplished by palpating the dental alveolus of the infant/toddler to establish if developing tooth buds (which manifest as bulges in alveolus) are present. A dental evaluation by age one year is recommended.

Dental radiographs, essential to determining the extent of hypodontia and frequently taken in the toddler or child using panoramic or conventional dental radiographic techniques

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
