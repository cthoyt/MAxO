The following recommendations for evaluation of individuals diagnosed with Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) are based on recent guidelines [Kline et al 2007b] (full text) and the authors' experience:

Gastrointestinal evaluation (including upper GI series, endoscopy, milk scan and/or pH probe) to evaluate for malrotation and gastrointestinal reflux which, if undiagnosed or undertreated, can lead to feeding intolerance, life-threatening recurrent aspiration, and volvulus

Plotting growth parameters on CdLS-specific growth charts. See www.cdlsusa.org (girls; boys).

Evaluation by a nutritionist if CdLS growth curves reveal failure to thrive

Radiographs of the upper extremities to evaluate for radioulnar synostosis. Physical therapy must be performed with caution to avoid causing fractures if radioulnar synostosis is present.

Multidisciplinary developmental evaluation to formulate education/therapeutic interventions with an emphasis on communication skills

Audiology evaluation with auditory brain stem response testing and otoacoustic emission testing to assess for hearing loss

Ophthalmologic evaluation, including assessment of visual acuity, dilated fundus examination, measurement of intraocular pressure, and evaluation of tear ducts for patency and function

Echocardiogram to screen for cardiac defects. ASDs are common and may not be picked up by auscultation.

Neurologic evaluation and EEG in all affected individuals

Renal ultrasonography to evaluate for structural kidney anomalies; if indicated, a vesicoureterogram (VCUG) to evaluate for vesicoureteral reflux

Urologic evaluation in males with hypospadias and/or cryptorchidism

Pelvic ultrasound to evaluate for bicornuate uterus in females; pelvic ultrasound can be performed at the same time as the renal ultrasound

Complete blood count if signs of anemia, bruising, bleeding are present

Complete blood count, immune profile (consisting of immunoglobulins; antibodies to tetanus, dipetheria, and pneumococcus; B-cell panel; and T-cell panel) and consideration of immunologic evaluation if recurrent infections are present

Consultation with a clinical geneticist
