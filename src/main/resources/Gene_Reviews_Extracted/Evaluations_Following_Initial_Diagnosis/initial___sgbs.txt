To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome type 1 (SGBS1), the following evaluations are recommended:

Assessment of neonates for hypoglycemia

Assessment for upper airway sufficiency if macroglossia is present

Evaluation of young children with hypotonia and macroglossia for sleep apnea

Evaluation by a craniofacial team, including a feeding specialist if orofacial clefting is present

Hearing evaluation

Eye examination

Cardiac evaluation for structural defects and conduction abnormalities including chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram

Renal ultrasound examination to evaluate for genitourinary malformations

Abdominal/pelvic ultrasound examination to evaluate for intra-abdominal tumors

Abdominal ultrasound examination to evaluate for visceral anomalies; further studies (e.g., MRI) if findings are suspicious

Examination for evidence of skeletal anomalies requiring intervention (e.g., scoliosis during period of rapid growth rate)

Development assessment including speech and language assessment

Neurology evaluation / MRI of the brain if seizures are present
