To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Stickler syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended:

Evaluation of palate by a craniofacial specialist

Baseline ophthalmologic examination

Baseline audiogram

Directed history to elicit complaints suggestive of mitral valve prolapse (MVP), such as episodic tachycardia and chest pain. If symptoms are present, referral to a cardiologist should be made.

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
