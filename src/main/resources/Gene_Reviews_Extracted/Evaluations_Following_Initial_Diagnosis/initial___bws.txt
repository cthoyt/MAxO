To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Assessment for airway sufficiency in the presence of macroglossia

Evaluation by a feeding specialist if macroglossia causes significant feeding difficulties

Assessment of neonates for hypoglycemia; evaluation by a pediatric endocrinologist if hypoglycemia persists beyond the first few days of life.

Abdominal ultrasound examination to assess for organomegaly, structural abnormality, and tumors

Comprehensive cardiac evaluation including ECG and echocardiogram prior to surgical procedures or when a cardiac abnormality is suspected on clinical evaluation

Alpha-fetoprotein assay at the time of initial diagnosis to evaluate for hepatoblastoma. It is important to utilize normal ranges for specific age categories to guide result interpretation, especially in very young infants.

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
