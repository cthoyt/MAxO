Most individuals diagnosed with Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS) have the craniofacial and limb anomalies only. As for all individuals with malformations, a dysmorphology examination is appropriate to exclude other anomalies.

Sophisticated imaging, especially of the CNS, is not routinely indicated unless the clinician detects findings or symptoms that specifically indicate such an evaluation.

Similarly, as most individuals with GCPS have normal development, screening beyond the standard Denver Developmental Screening test is not recommended.

Treatment of Manifestations *

The author is not aware of craniofacial reconstructive surgery being performed on individuals with GCPS as the widely spaced eyes and macrocephaly are generally not sufficiently severe to warrant surgery.

Repair of polydactyly should be undertaken on an elective basis. Preaxial polydactyly of the hands is considered to be a higher priority for surgical correction than postaxial polydactyly of the hand or any type of polydactyly of the foot because of the importance of early and proper development of the prehensile grasp.

Cutaneous syndactyly of the fingers is usually repaired if it is more than minimal.

As is true for any malformation of the feet, surgical correction must be carefully considered. Cosmetic benefits and easier fitting of shoes can be outweighed by potential orthopedic complications.

Seizures are treated symptomatically.

*As with the diagnostic criteria (see Diagnosis), no published data support these recommendations, which are those of the author.
