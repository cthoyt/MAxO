To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with VCAN-related vitreoretinopathy, the following evaluations are recommended:

Baseline ophthalmologic examination including best corrected visual acuity, assessment of intraocular pressure, slit-lamp examination of the anterior segment, and biomicroscopy and indirect ophthalmoscopy of the posterior segment

Visual field examination

Photographic fundus documentation

Optical coherence tomography (OCT), if available. While not mandatory, OCT scan is useful to assess the vitreoretinal interface, quantify atrophic changes of the central retina, and evaluate for cystoid macular edema.

Electroretinogram

Orthoptic assessment

Consultation with a medical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
