To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with a known ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder, the following evaluations are recommended:

Rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP)

Brain imaging to exclude stroke

EEG to evaluate possibility of seizures

Neuropsychological testing to evaluate cognitive or memory problems

Note: Questionnaires to prompt treating clinicians to elicit history and observations relevant to disease symptoms and management may be obtained from organizations included in Resources.

Alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC)

Brain imaging to exclude stroke

EEG to evaluate possibility of seizures

Note: Questionnaires to prompt treating clinicians to elicit history and observations relevant to disease symptoms and management may be obtained from organizations included in Resources.

Cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss (CAPOS) syndrome

Brain imaging to evaluate the cerebellum

EMG for areflexia and assessment for pes cavus to evaluate for peripheral neuropathy

Ophthalmology consult and OCT (optical coherence tomography) for evaluation of optic atrophy

Audiogram and hearing specialist consultation to evaluate sensorineural hearing loss
