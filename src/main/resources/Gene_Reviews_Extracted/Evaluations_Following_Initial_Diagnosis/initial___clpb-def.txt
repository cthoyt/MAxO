To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with CLPB deficiency, the following evaluations are recommended:

Complete physical examination

Complete neurologic examination, including brain MRI (if not performed at the time of diagnosis)

Developmental assessment or IQ testing (depending on the age of the individual at the time of diagnosis)

For those with significant neurologic problems:

Complete evaluation of feeding and diet to determine if tube feeding or gastrostomy is necessary

Evaluation of excessive drooling to determine if the risk of aspiration and/or dehydration is increased

Complete ophthalmologic examination to evaluate for cataracts (if not performed at the time of diagnosis)

Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is recommended to determine the need for granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment.

Ultrasound examination of the kidneys for evidence of nephrocalcinosis or cysts

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
