To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with hypophosphatasia, the following evaluations are recommended:

Blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine concentration to assess renal function

Serum concentration of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium

Serum concentration of 25(OH) and 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D, nPTH (parathyroid hormone, N-terminal part) to assess rickets

Assessment of pulmonary function in infants with the perinatal type to assist in prognosis and distinguishing between the perinatal (severe) type and the perinatal (benign) type

Radiographs of the skull to assess for craniosynostosis in young children with the infantile form of hypophosphatasia

Baseline dental evaluation

Baseline orthopedic evaluation

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
