To establish the extent of disease and needs in each individual with newly diagnosed PROP1-related combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD), it is important to evaluate for deficiencies of GH, TSH, LH, FSH, PRL, and ACTH because treatment of one hormone deficiency can precipitate symptoms of another hormone deficiency:

A total T4 assay can be used to evaluate thyroid hormone production.

Evaluation of LH and FSH production is more relevant in postpubertal individuals, particularly if sexual development is incomplete or if women display hypoestrogenic amenorrhea.

AM cortisol can be used to evaluate adrenal hormone production.

Medical genetics consultation is appropriate.
