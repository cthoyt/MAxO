To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features (ADPEAF), the following evaluations are recommended:

A clinical history from the individual and witnesses to establish seizure types and their frequencies, and symptoms associated with each seizure type

Routine interictal EEG

Routine clinical imaging to rule out structural abnormalities

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
