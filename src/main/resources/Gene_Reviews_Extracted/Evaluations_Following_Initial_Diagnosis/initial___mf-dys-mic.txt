To establish medical needs and extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with mandibulofacial dysostosis with microcephaly (MFDM), the following evaluations are recommended:

In newborns: airway assessment for evidence of upper-airway obstruction with or without choanal atresia and urgent evaluation for possible esophageal atresia

Audiology assessment (see Hereditary Hearing Loss and Deafness Overview)

Examination for midline cleft palate, and referral to multidisciplinary cleft palate team as required

Cardiology and/or echocardiographic assessment for structural heart defects

Renal ultrasound examination

Developmental assessment

Other evaluations as dictated by the specific clinical situation (e.g., skeletal x-ray for scoliosis)

Clinical genetics consultation
