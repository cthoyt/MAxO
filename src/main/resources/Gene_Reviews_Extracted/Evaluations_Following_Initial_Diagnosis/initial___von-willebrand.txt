To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with von Willebrand disease (VWD), the following evaluations are recommended:

A personal and family history of bleeding to help predict severity and tailor treatment. Use of a bleeding assessment tool can facilitate standardized assessment [International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2011, Tosetto et al 2011].

A joint and muscle evaluation for those with type 3 VWD (musculoskeletal bleeding is rare in types 1 and 2 VWD).

Screening for hepatitis B and C as well as HIV if the diagnosis is type 3 VWD or if the individual received blood products or plasma-derived clotting factor concentrates before 1985.

Baseline serum concentration of iron and ferritin to assess iron stores, as many individuals with VWD (particularly women with menorrhagia) are iron deficient

Gynecologic evaluation for women with menorrhagia [Demers et al 2005]

Medical genetics consultation
