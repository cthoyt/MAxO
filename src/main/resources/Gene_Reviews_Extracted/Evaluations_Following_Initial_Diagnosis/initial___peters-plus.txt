To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Peters plus syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended if they have not already been completed:

Complete ophthalmologic assessment including ocular ultrasonography for characterization of the eye anomaly and an assessment for associated ocular defects

Growth hormone stimulation testing to address the possibility of a treatable cause of growth delay in those affected individuals in whom increased height would improve quality of life

For neonates or infants, referral to an infant development program for appropriate developmental assessment

Echocardiography for congenital heart malformations

Abdominal ultrasound examination for renal anomalies

Cranial imaging with head ultrasound examination or CT scan/MRI for hydrocephalus and/or structural brain abnormalities if neurologic symptoms are present

Thyroid function testing in all infants who have not undergone newborn screening for congenital hypothyroidism

Hearing assessment in a child with cleft palate or speech delay

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
