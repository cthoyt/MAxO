To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with lysinuric protein intolerance, the following evaluations are recommended:

History for evidence of hyperammonemic crises with overt neurologic manifestations (vomiting, drowsiness, coma) and of respiratory involvement (cough, dyspnea, recurrent lower respiratory tract infections)

Neurologic evaluation to detect secondary neurologic damage

Respiratory evaluation including chest x-ray, pulmonary high-resolution computed tomography, and function tests

Evaluation and follow-up of growth parameters

Liver and spleen ultrasound examination to monitor liver structural changes and spleen enlargement

Hematologic evaluation (bone marrow aspirate may be required)

Immunologic assessment including plasma concentrations of immune globulins and, when clinically indicated, detection of autoimmune antibodies and immune complexes

Renal function studies

Bone density evaluation
