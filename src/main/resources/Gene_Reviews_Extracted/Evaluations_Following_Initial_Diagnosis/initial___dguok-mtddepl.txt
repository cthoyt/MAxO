To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with DGUOK deficiency, the following evaluations are recommended.

For both neonatal multisystem diseases and isolated hepatic disease

Evaluation of hepatic status by a physician familiar with the care of children with liver failure. Initial testing should include measurement of serum concentrations of ALT, AST, GGT, bilirubin, albumin, and coagulation profile.

Hepatic sonography and AFP to screen for hepatocellular carcinoma. AFP is a sensitive, but not specific, marker used to differentiate hepatocellular carcinoma from nonmalignant liver disease. Although the value of a highly elevated serum concentration of AFP in the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma in DGUOK deficiency is not known, the possibility of hepatocellular carcinoma should be considered in individuals with a solid tumor detected by abdominal ultrasound examination and a highly increased serum AFP concentration [Freisinger et al 2006].

Nutritional assessment by a dietician with experience in managing children with hepatic failure

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Additional evaluation for neonatal multisystem diseases

Measurement of plasma lactate and fasting blood sugar

Comprehensive neurologic examination and developmental/cognitive assessment. Neuroimaging may be considered.

Additional evaluation for isolated hepatic disease. Urine analysis and evaluation for urine amino acids to evaluate for renal involvement
