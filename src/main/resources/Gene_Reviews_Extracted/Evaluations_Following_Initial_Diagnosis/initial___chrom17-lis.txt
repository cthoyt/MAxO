To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with LIS1-associated lissencephaly/ subcortical band heterotopia (SBH), the following are recommended:

Evaluation of:

Growth

Feeding and nutrition

Respiratory status

Development

Seizures

Clinical genetics consultation

MRI should be interpreted carefully to provide as much prognostic information as possible. Note: Although most affected individuals have severe to profound intellectual disability, a minority have less extensive lissencephaly that results in only moderate intellectual disability, and a few have limited malformations that allow near-normal development. In the latter, the lissencephaly or SBH is typically less severe and less extensive on MRI. The resolution of brain CT scan is not usually sufficient to allow this.
