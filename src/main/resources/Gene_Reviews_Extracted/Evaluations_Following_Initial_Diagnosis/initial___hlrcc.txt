To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC), the following evaluations are recommended:

Detailed dermatologic examination for evaluation of extent of disease and lesions suspicious for cutaneous leiomyosarcoma to include biopsy for histologic confirmation

Baseline pelvic bimanual examination, pelvic MRI, and/or transvaginal pelvic ultrasound examination to screen for uterine fibroids

Baseline renal ultrasound examination and MRI to screen for renal tumors; abdominal CT scan with contrast should be reserved for when MRI is contraindicated

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
