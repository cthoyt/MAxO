Clinical practice guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome have been published [Bassett et al 2011] (full text).

To establish the extent of disease and the needs of an individual diagnosed with 22q11.2DS, the following evaluations are recommended (if not performed as part of the evaluation that led to the diagnosis):

A baseline cardiac evaluation by a cardiologist that includes a chest x-ray, ECG, and echocardiogram; a chest MRI may be required if a vascular ring is suspected.

Measurement of serum ionized calcium concentration and intact parathyroid hormone level to assess for hypoparathyroidism, followed by a formal endocrinology evaluation if abnormal

TSH level

Complete blood cell count with differential. A low absolute lymphocyte count necessitates evaluation of T- and B-cell subsets and referral to an immunologist.

Immunologic evaluation, which may include flow cytometry, immunoglobulins, and T-cell function

Renal ultrasound examination to evaluate for structural renal defects

Consideration of ophthalmology evaluation

Audiology evaluation

Chest x-ray to evaluate for thoracic vertebral anomalies

Cervical spine films (six views: flexion, extension, AP, lateral, open mouth, skull base) in all individuals over age four years (the age that the cervical spine becomes better ossified)

Clinical evaluation of the palate to screen for palatal anomalies which may affect feeding and speech development

Assessment for possible feeding problems including significant gastroesophageal reflux; difficulty with sucking/swallowing, advancing feeds, addition of textured foods; vomiting and constipation

Speech and language assessment by age one year given that almost all children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome have delay in emergence of language and would benefit from early intervention strategies. In addition, such an evaluation aids in the diagnosis of a palatal abnormality/VPI.

As needed:

Evaluation of children with short stature (height below the 2nd percentile) by an endocrinologist for possible growth hormone deficiency

Evaluation by a psychologist or psychiatrist of any person with evidence of anxiety, mood disorder, behavioral differences, or frank psychosis

Evaluation by a hematologist of any person with a history of a bruising/bleeding disorder
