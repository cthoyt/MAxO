To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with a TUBB4A-related leukodystrophy, the following evaluations are recommended [Van Haren et al 2015]:

Evaluation by a pediatric neurologist for evidence of developmental delay, spasticity, and extrapyramidal movement disorders

Assessment of developmental milestones and cognitive function

Assessment of functional disability and equipment needs by a physiotherapist

Assessment of speech (communication) and feeding (swallowing)

Audiologic assessment

Orthopedic evaluation for evidence of scoliosis and/or joint deformity, particularly in individuals with significant dystonia

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
