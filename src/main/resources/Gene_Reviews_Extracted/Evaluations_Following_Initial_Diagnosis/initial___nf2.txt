To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2), the following evaluations are recommended:

Head MRI

Hearing evaluation, including BAER

Ophthalmologic evaluation

Cutaneous examination

Clinical genetics consultation

Note: Evaluation and treatment of individuals with neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) are best undertaken in an NF2 center experienced in managing the multiple complications of the disease [Baser et al 2002, Evans et al 2005a].
