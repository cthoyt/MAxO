To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with the 2q37 microdeletion syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended:

Complete medical history to include evidence of any congenital malformations, seizure disorder, or behavioral problems

Complete physical and dysmorphology examination

Determination of head circumference, height, weight, and other anthropometric measurements

Specialty evaluation of obesity or failure to thrive

Multidisciplinary developmental and neurologic evaluation to assess motor and cognitive skills as well as autism, autism spectrum behaviors, and other behavioral issues

Echocardiogram to evaluate for congenital cardiac anomaly

Renal ultrasound examination to evaluate for possible Wilms tumor, renal malformation, or other renal problems

Ophthalmology evaluation for strabismus and/or refractive errors

Audiologic assessment for possible hearing loss

Brain imaging studies (MRI, CT scan) in individuals with abnormal neurologic findings

EEG for evaluation of seizures and treatment monitoring

X-ray to evaluate for the presence of scoliosis and skeletal anomalies examination. While the clinical implications of osteopenia have not been studied in the 2q37 microdeletion syndrome, clinicians should be aware that this is a common finding. x-rays should be performed at diagnosis and should be repeated as warranted by clinical examination. The youngest individual with osteopenia in the authors' series is age three years.
