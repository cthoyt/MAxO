To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with autosomal dominant familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (adFEVR), the following evaluations are recommended:

Ophthalmologic examination, including indirect ophthalmoscopy and scleral depression

Fundus fluorescein angiography, which increases the detection rate of peripheral avascularity in asymptomatic affected individuals [Ober et al 1980]
