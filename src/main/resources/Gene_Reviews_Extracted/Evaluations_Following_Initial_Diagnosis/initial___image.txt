To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with IMAGe syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended:

Endocrinologic evaluation* to manage adrenal insufficiency, typically including:

Serum and urine concentration of electrolytes

Serum concentration of glucose and ACTH

Assessment of arterial blood gases

Consultation with an endocrinologist

*Of note, individuals who are in shock often have hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, acidosis, markedly elevated serum ACTH, and increased urinary excretion of sodium.

Urogenital evaluation and consultation with a urologist to consider management of undescended testicles and/or genital surgery

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
