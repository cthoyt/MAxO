To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVC), the following evaluations are recommended if not performed at the time of diagnosis:

ECG

Echocardiogram and/or MRI, depending on the expertise of the imaging center

Noninvasive monitoring. Cardiac rhythm can be monitored noninvasively through Holter or event monitoring, and this is an effective means of detecting ventricular ectopy including nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Implantable loop recorders can also be used in individuals with ARVC for whom arrhythmia risks are not clear. Signal-averaged ECGs may also be useful [Philips & Cheng 2016].

Electrophysiology study to assess the risk for ventricular arrhythmias and the appropriateness of device insertion (e.g., an implantable cardioverter defibrillator). A cardiac catheter ablation of tissue causing abnormal rhythms can be performed during the electrophysiology study; however, ablation may not be effective long term in individuals with ARVC because of the multiple sites of primary ventricular tachycardias.
