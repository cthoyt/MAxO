Currently, no consensus exists regarding the appropriate extent of evaluation at the time of initial diagnosis.

Approach to a vascular evaluation depends on the age of the individual and the circumstances in which the diagnosis is made. Because of the risk of asymptomatic aneurysm/dissection, initial visualization of the arterial tree is commonly undertaken [Chu et al 2014]; the approach employed varies by geographic region and by institution (see Surveillance).

Because no specific gastrointestinal findings are known to precede or predict bowel rupture, there is no benefit from invasive GI evaluation.

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor is appropriate.

Establishment of an organized care team including a primary care physician, vascular surgeon, general surgeon, and a geneticist may aid in emergency preparedness. In addition, individuals with vEDS should carry documentation of their genetic diagnosis, such as a MedicAlertÂ® or emergency letter.
