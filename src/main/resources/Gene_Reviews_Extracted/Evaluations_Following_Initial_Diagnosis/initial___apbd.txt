To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with adult polyglucosan body disease (APBD), the following evaluations are recommended:

MRI of the brain and spinal column to exclude other treatable causes of gait spasticity and neurogenic bladder

Assessment of post-void residual and consultation with a urologist to identify and manage complications of a neurogenic bladder

Bedside or formal neuropsychometric analysis to assess for early signs of cognitive impairment

Clinical genetics consultation
