To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS), the following are recommended:

Complete ophthalmologic evaluation

Skin examination for severity of hypopigmentation and, after infancy, for evidence of skin damage and skin cancer

History of bleeding problems and symptoms suggesting pulmonary fibrosis and/or colitis. For evaluation for lung fibrosis, pulmonary function tests (PFTs) should be performed in individuals older than age 20 years.

Clinical genetics consultation
