To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with familial transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis, the following evaluations are recommended:

Complete neurologic assessment including baseline nerve conduction studies

Evaluation of the heart:

Echocardiogram, the most useful noninvasive test for cardiac amyloidosis, for visualization of ventricular wall thickness, ventricular septal thickness, and hyperrefractile myocardial echoes (so called "granular sparkling appearance")

Electrocardiogram (ECG) to evaluate for characteristic findings of cardiac amyloidosis including low voltage in the standard limb leads and QS pattern in the right precordial leads with or without conduction blocks

Myocardial technetium-99m-pyrophosphate scintigraphy to visualize amyloid deposition in heart [Ikeda 2004]

Gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the brain and spinal cord to evaluate CNS amyloidosis [Mitsuhashi et al 2004]

Ophthalmologic evaluation

Evaluation of renal function

Genetics consultation
