To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Developmental assessment to determine the types of services and educational strategies needed. In school-aged children this information is important for the childâ€™s individual education program (IEP).

Assessment for the use of nonverbal communication devices and strategies (given that most patients do not develop useful speech)

Child behavior specialist to aid with behavioral concerns

Pulmonary consultation if history of respiratory pattern abnormality is identified on directed questioning. Polysomnography may be indicated if there is a history of episodic apnea especially when associated with cyanosis (typically alternating with episodes of hyperventilation).

Child neurology evaluation if there are concerns about seizure episodes

Ophthalmology evaluation to evaluate for myopia, astigmatism, and/or strabismus

Gastroenterology evaluation to establish treatment regimen for chronic constipation

Musculoskeletal evaluation to evaluate ambulatory skills and need for special mobility equipment and/or orthotics to aid in foot position

Clinical genetics consultation
