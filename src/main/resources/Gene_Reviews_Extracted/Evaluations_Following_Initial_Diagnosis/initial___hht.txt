To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), the following evaluations are recommended [Faughnan et al 2011, McDonald et al 2011a]:

Medical history, with particular attention to epistaxis and other bleeding, anemia or polycythemia, diseases of the heart, lung and liver, and neurologic symptoms

Physical examination including inspection for telangiectases (particularly on fingers, lips, tongue, oropharynx, cheeks, or conjunctiva) and listening for abdominal bruits

Complete blood count, with particular attention to anemia or polycythemia. If anemia is present, it is important to consider other causes of anemia, particularly when the anemia appears to be disproportionate to the amount of epistaxis. People with HHT may develop medical problems unrelated to HHT (e.g., ulcers or colon cancer) that can cause GI blood loss. Polycythemia raises suspicion for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations.

Contrast echocardiography for detection of pulmonary shunting/AVM and measurement of the pulmonary artery systolic pressure as a screen for pulmonary artery hypertension. When pulmonary shunting is suggested (or if dependable contrast echocardiography is not available), CT angiography with cuts of 3 mm or less to define size and location of lesions(s) is the next step.

Head MRI (with and without gadolinium) to detect cerebral AVMs, performed as early as possible, preferably in the first year of life. Adults, including those screened with MRI in infancy, should all have a screening head MRI to detect unsuspected vascular lesions and occult cerebral abscesses.

Consideration of ultrasound or CT examination for evidence of hepatic AVM if the individual has symptoms such as high-output failure associated with hepatic vascular abnormalities or otherwise unexplained elevations in liver function tests, or if presence of a visceral AVM would confirm a diagnosis of HHT

Note: Screening for hepatic AVMs in asymptomatic individuals is not common practice because:

Hepatic AVMs are not usually symptomatic and, when they do become symptomatic, it is not sudden and catastrophic, as is seen with pulmonary AVMs and cerebral AVMs; and

Treatment options for hepatic AVMs are less satisfactory than those for pulmonary or cerebral AVMs.

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
