To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with polymicrogyria, the following evaluations are recommended:

Evaluations by physical therapists, occupational therapists, and other specialists in infancy and the preschool years because of the high risk of intellectual disability and cerebral palsy

Assessment of special educational needs

Speech evaluations for those with perisylvian polymicrogyria

Vision and hearing evaluation as clinically appropriate

EEG in the presence of episodic clinical events of uncertain cause
