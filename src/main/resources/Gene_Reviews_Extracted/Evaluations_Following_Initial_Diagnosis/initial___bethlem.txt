Bethlem myopathy. To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with Bethlem myopathy, the following evaluations are recommended:

Evaluation of degree of muscle weakness and mobility

Joint examination for contractures

Physiotherapy assessment and advice regarding stretches/splints for contractures and mobility aids

Possibly orthopedic evaluation if surgery is to be considered for tendon Achilles contractures

Assessment of respiratory status

Seek history of clinical symptoms of nocturnal hypoventilation such as early morning nausea and headaches, daytime somnolence.

Evaluation of degree of muscle weakness and mobility

Examination of back for scoliosis

Joint examination for contractures and hyperlaxity

Physiotherapy assessment and advice regarding stretches/splints for contractures and mobility aids such as swivel walkers and standing frames to achieve upright posture and protect against the development of scoliosis and other contractures

Possibly x-rays of thoracolumbar spine and orthopedic evaluation if scoliosis is clinically suspected

Possibly orthopedic evaluation if hip dislocation is suspected or surgery is to be considered for tendon Achilles contractures

Assessment of respiratory status

Seek history of clinical symptoms of nocturnal hypoventilation such as early morning nausea and headaches, daytime somnolence.

Inquire about frequency and severity of chest infections; if any concerns, perform spirometry and nocturnal pulse oximetry.
