To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with Joubert syndrome (JS), the following baseline evaluations to identify the extent of disease in affected infants/children are recommended [Parisi et al 2007] (full text). Recommendations were developed by a consensus panel and are outlined on the Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders Foundation web site.

Examination of high-quality MRI scan to assess for cerebral malformations, neuronal migration disorders, or cephaloceles that could portend a poorer prognosis or seizures, if not done at the time of diagnosis

A baseline neurologic evaluation with particular attention to tone, respiratory pattern (tachypnea and apnea), eye movements, development, and cerebellar function

Sleep history with polysomnogram as baseline evaluation and particularly if symptomatic apnea is present

Assessment of oromotor function by a speech therapist and/or by fluoroscopic swallowing studies

Developmental assessment with age-appropriate tools

Evaluation by a pediatric ophthalmologist via dilated eye examination for colobomas and retinal changes, as well as strabismus and ptosis, with consideration of specialized testing such as visual-evoked potentials, electroretinogram, and ocular motility testing

Abdominal ultrasound examination to evaluate for hepatic fibrosis or renal cysts and/or findings consistent with nephronophthisis (e.g., loss of corticomedullary differentiation)

Tests of renal function, including blood pressure, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine concentration, complete blood count (CBC), and urinalysis from first-morning void for specific gravity to test concentrating ability (if feasible)

Liver function tests including serum concentrations of transaminases, albumin, bilirubin, and prothrombin time

For males with micropenis or any child with signs of growth hormone deficiency, endocrine evaluation for other pituitary abnormalities

Skeletal survey and/or limb radiographs if there is suspicion of a skeletal dysplasia such as short-rib polydactyly or JATD

Consultation with a clinical geneticist to document family history, to evaluate growth and head size, and to evaluate for other anomalies including polydactyly, dysmorphic facial features, tongue tumors/lobulations, and micropenis
