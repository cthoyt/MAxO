To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS), the following are recommended:

Assessment for evidence of the accelerated phase including [Filipovich 2006]:

History of unexplained, persistent, or recurrent fever

Splenomegaly

Cytopenia of at least two cell lines

Signs of liver dysfunction including hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypofibrinogenemia

Elevated serum ferritin concentration

Elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor level

Evidence of hemophagocytosis in bone marrow and/or cerebrospinal fluid

Comprehensive neurologic examination

Screening for a history of frequent or unusual infections

Screening for clinical signs of lymphoma. The hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis associated with CHS may have this clinical appearance.

Medical genetics consultation
