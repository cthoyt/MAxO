To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with nemaline myopathy (NM), the following evaluations are recommended:

Thorough assessment of respiratory status, including pulmonary function studies and assessment for nocturnal hypoxia

For early-onset forms, assessment of feeding abilities (sucking, swallowing, gastroesophageal reflux) and growth parameters to determine the need for feeding interventions such as gavage feeding or gastrostomy insertion

Physical examination to evaluate for joint contractures

Physical examination to evaluate for scoliosis, followed by spinal x-ray if scoliosis is suspected

Physical and occupational therapy evaluations relevant to the degree of weakness

Speech therapy evaluation if dysarthria and/or hypernasal speech is present

Orthodontic evaluation if palatal anomalies are present

Evaluation for the presence of dilated cardiomyopathy (rare association)

Clinical genetics consultation
