To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with Lowe syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended:

Infants should be evaluated for feeding problems and gastroesophageal reflux, including a pH probe study.

Growth parameters should be measured and plotted on a growth chart.

An ophthalmologic evaluation is needed to assess for cataract and glaucoma. Behavior problems may necessitate the use of anesthesia for eye examinations.

Renal tubular function should be assessed by measurement of serum electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus and creatinine, and simultaneous urinalysis and random urine pH, electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, amino acids, protein and retinol binding protein, and/or N-acetyl glucosaminidase, if available. Interpretation of these results allows diagnosis of type 2 renal tubular acidosis, hypokalemia, phosphate wasting with decreased tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TRP), hypercalciuria (urine calcium/creatinine ratio >0.02), amino aciduria, albuminuria (urine dipstick positive albumin and urine protein/creatinine ratio >0.2), low molecular-weight proteinuria, and renal glomerular insufficiency (serum creatinine).

If acidosis or phosphaturia is present, serum concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and parathyroid hormone should be measured and bone radiographs should be obtained to evaluate for renal rickets. Bone radiographs should also be obtained in boys with bone pain or point tenderness to evaluate for fractures in the absence of rickets.

If hematuria or hypercalciuria is present, a renal ultrasound examination should be performed to screen for nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis.

Plasma carnitinine may be measured to evaluate for carnintine deficiency.

Developmental and behavioral evaluations should be completed.

An electroencephalogram (EEG) is often needed to document the exact type of seizures and to determine appropriate anticonvulsant therapy.
