To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Wilson disease, the following evaluations are recommended:

Evaluation of severity of the liver disease by liver biopsy or by biochemical testing and imaging of the liver

Upper GI endoscopy to exclude or confirm esophageal varices

Detailed clinical neurologic assessment. A validated neurologic rating scale is available [Cz≈Çonkowska et al 2007].

Brain MRI to assess for structural alteration

Assessment of kidney function

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
