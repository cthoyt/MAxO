To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Perrault syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended:

Clinical genetics consultation

Endocrinology assessment in women: serum estrogen and gonadotropin (LH and FSH) concentrations. In women with relatively intact ovarian function, serum anti-m√ºllerian hormone concentrations may provide evidence of incipient ovarian failure [De Vos et al 2010].

Pelvic imaging in women by ultrasound scan or magnetic resonance imaging to define the presence of ovaries and antral follicle count

Audiologic assessment in men and women to define the degree and frequency range of hearing impairment by audiometry and physiologic tests (as summarized in Deafness and Hereditary Hearing Loss Overview)

Neurologic assessment to determine if ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and/or learning disability is present
