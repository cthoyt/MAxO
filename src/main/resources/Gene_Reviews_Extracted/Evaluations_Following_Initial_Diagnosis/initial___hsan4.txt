To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA) (also known as hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IV [HSAN IV]), the following evaluations are recommended:

General physical examination for evidence of self-mutilation of tongue, lips, buccal mucosa; skin injury including infection and/or palmoplantar hyperkeratosis, bone injury including old poorly healing fractures and/or joint injury including dislocations, as well as behavioral and developmental problems

Orthopedic consultation regarding assessment of injuries of the extremities and weight-bearing joints, including radiographs as necessary

Dental examination to assess for auto-extraction of teeth, evidence of dental caries and/or abscess, as well as overall dental health

Ophthalmologic examination to assess for evidence of neuropathic keratitis and its sequelae (corneal infection, ulceration, and/or perforation)

Clinical genetics consultation
