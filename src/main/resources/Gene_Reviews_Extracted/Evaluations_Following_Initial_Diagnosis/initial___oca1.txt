To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1), the following evaluations are recommended:

Complete ophthalmologic evaluation, including assessment for the presence of nystagmus, ocular alignment and strabismus, iris pigmentation and transillumination, dilated retinal examination assessing retinal pigment epithelial hypopigmentation and foveal hypoplasia, and best corrected visual acuity (with cycloplegic refraction);

Evaluation of the pigmentation status of the skin, especially the solar-exposed skin, and the adnexa (brows, lashes, and when appropriate extremity hair and pubic hair), linked to a (pediatric) dermatologic consultation for sun-protective clothing, lotions, and future self-care;

Clinical genetics consultation to review natural history, pattern of inheritance and recurrence risks, and to clarify genotype.

Parents should be assured repeatedly that the visual disability with OCA1 does not deteriorate over time, that changes in acuity are usually refractive in nature, that the nystagmus tends to dampen with age (but never disappears), that many children with OCA1B manifest slow improvement in acuity and some plateau by their teen years, and that intellectual disabilities are not a component of this group of disorders.
