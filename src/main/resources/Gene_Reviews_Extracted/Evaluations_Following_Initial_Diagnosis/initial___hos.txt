To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Holt-Oram syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended:

Genetic. Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Limb

Limb involvement is determined by physical examination.

If limb involvement is not grossly obvious, upper-limb and hand radiographs can be performed to determine if subtle anomalies of the carpal bones are present.

Cardiac

Chest radiography may demonstrate enlarged pulmonary arteries caused by pulmonary hypertension or cardiomegaly and/or evidence of congestive heart failure.

Echocardiography is the procedure of choice to define the presence of septal defects or other structural cardiac anomalies.

ECG is recommended for the detection of cardiac conduction disease.
