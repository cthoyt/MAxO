To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with ADCY5-related dyskinesia, the following are recommended:

Neurologic consultation with particular attention to documenting the findings on neurologic examination, and response or lack of response to medications

Consideration of cardiac evaluation, as cardiomyopathy may be a manifestation of ADCY5-related dyskinesia [Chen et al 2011]

Social services consultation (depending on the severity of the paroxysms), as disease severity may qualify some patients for disability or social security benefits

Clinical genetics consultation
