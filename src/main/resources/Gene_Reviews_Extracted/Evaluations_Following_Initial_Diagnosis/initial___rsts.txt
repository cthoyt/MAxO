To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS), the following evaluations are suggested [Wiley et al 2003]:

Measurement of growth and plotting of parameters on published syndrome-specific growth charts

Multidisciplinary developmental evaluation including assessment of gross and fine motor skills, speech/language, cognitive abilities, and vocational skills

Ophthalmologic examination

Hearing evaluation using auditory brain stem evoked response testing (see Deafness and Hereditary Hearing Loss Overview for details of evaluation)

Dental and orthodontic evaluations

Echocardiogram or evaluation by cardiologist for structural heart defects

Assessment for gastroesophageal reflux as warranted

Assessment for constipation

Renal ultrasound examination

Assessment for presence of cryptorchidism in males

Orthopedic assessment of thumbs and halluces, joints and spine

Evaluation of obstructive sleep apnea if indicated by snoring, particular sleeping posture, wakefulness at night, and excessive sleepiness during the daytime.

Ultrasound of the spinal canal in the neonatal period to screen for tethered cord; MRI of the spinal canal should be performed in older children, if symptomatic.

Clinical genetics consultation
