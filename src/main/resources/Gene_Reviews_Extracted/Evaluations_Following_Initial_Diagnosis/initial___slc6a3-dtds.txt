To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with a SLC6A3-related dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome (DTDS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Neurologic assessment of the movement disorder

Ophthalmology assessment of vision and eye movements

Evaluation of caloric intake and feeding by a nutritionist

Speech and language therapy assessment of communication and swallowing

Physiotherapy evaluation of postural issues and tone

Occupational therapy to provide suitable aids for communication, mobility, and home adaptations

Hip and spine x-rays to evaluate for hip dislocation and spinal deformity

Orthopedic review of any fixed contractures / joint dislocations

Pediatric physician-led care for evaluation of general issues such as drooling, gastroesophageal reflux disease, constipation, disturbed sleeping, and pressure sores

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
