To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with incontinentia pigmenti (IP), the following evaluations are recommended:

Physical examination with particular emphasis on the skin, hair, nails, and neurologic system to establish the presence and extent of manifestations

Medical genetics consultation for diagnosis, treatment plan, testing, and family counseling

Involvement of a pediatric dermatologist for diagnosis, and for management of significantly involved cases

Prompt examination by an ophthalmologist familiar with IP and/or diseases of the retina for evidence of retinal neovascularization

EEG and MRI if seizures, other neurologic abnormalities, or retinal hypervascularization are present [Wolf et al 2005, Pascual-Castroviejo et al 2006]

Magnetic resonance angiography, potentially useful in identifying cerebrovascular lesions if the neurologic deficit is consistent with a stroke-like pattern

Developmental screening, with further evaluation if significant delays are identified
