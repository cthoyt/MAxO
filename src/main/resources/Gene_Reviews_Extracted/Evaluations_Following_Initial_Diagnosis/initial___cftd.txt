To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with congenital fiber-type disproportion, the following evaluations are recommended:

Medical history and physical examination with particular attention to the following:

Weakness

Hypotonia

Failure to thrive

Scoliosis

Contractures

Comprehensive respiratory evaluation in individuals with and without respiratory symptoms including the following:

Respiratory rate

Signs of respiratory distress

History of recurrent chest infections

Ability to maintain oxygen saturation

Pulmonary function studies

Sleep study to evaluate for nocturnal hypoxia and assess the need for ventilator support

Note: Some individuals with CFTD who have nocturnal hypoxia without symptoms can develop respiratory failure without warning.

Feeding evaluation including assessment of suck and swallow and gastroesophageal reflux

Speech therapy assessment, particularly if dysarthria and/or hypernasal speech are present

Cardiac evaluation for heart disease, including cor pulmonale and cardiomyopathy, particularly for those with pathogenic variants inTPM2 or MYH7 or those with an unknown genetic etiology. Evaluation should include echocardiogram and electrocardiogram.

Physical therapy and occupational therapy assessment

Screening for skeletal and orthopedic issues, including skeletal examination for scoliosis (after the child starts sitting), joint contractures, congenital hip dislocations, and foot deformities

Examination by a general dentist with referral for orthodontic evaluation if dental crowding becomes apparent

Clinical genetics consultation
