To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), the following evaluations of lung, liver, skin, and vasculature are recommended:

Lungs

Pulmonary function tests, including spirometry (with post-bronchodilator testing), lung volumes, diffusing capacity, and measures of oxygenation

Chest CT, which is more sensitive for detecting emphysema than pulmonary function tests [Stolk et al 2001], as part of the initial evaluation by some clinicians

Liver. Liver biopsy for light microscopy and histochemistry when definition of the precise nature and extent of liver disease is clinically indicated [Nelson et al 2012]

Skin. A detailed history and physical examination to assess for panniculitis
