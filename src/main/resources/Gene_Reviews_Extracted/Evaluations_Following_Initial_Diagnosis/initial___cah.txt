To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with 21-hydroxylase-deficient congenital adrenal hyperplasia (21-OHD CAH), the following evaluations are recommended:

To assess for salt wasting

Plasma renin activity (PRA)

Serum electrolytes

To distinguish classic from non-classic forms of 21-OHD CAH

Baseline 17-OHP, Δ4-androstenedione, cortisol, and aldosterone

ACTH stimulation test to compare stimulated concentration of 17-OHP to the baseline level

To assess the degree of prenatal virilization in females

Careful physical examination of the external genitalia and its orifices

Vaginogram to assess the anatomy of urethra and vagina

To assess the degree of postnatal virilization in both males and females

Bone maturation assessment by bone age

Serum concentration of adrenal androgens (unconjugated dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA], Δ4-androstenedione, and testosterone)

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor is recommended for those individuals with a new diagnosis of 21-OHD CAH.
