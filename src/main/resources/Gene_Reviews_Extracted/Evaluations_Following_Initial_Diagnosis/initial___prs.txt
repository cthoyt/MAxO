To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase (PRS) superactivity, the following evaluations are recommended:

All individuals. Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Juvenile/adult onset

Serum uric acid concentration

Joint examination for evidence of gout; generally, evaluation of joint integrity only, except during an acute flare of arthritis or an individual with chronic deformity or tophus formation following multiple attacks

Assessment of renal function and renal structural integrity (e.g., renal ultrasound examination)

Infantile onset. In addition to evaluations listed under Juvenile/adult onset:

Neurologic evaluation for hypotonia, ataxia, presence/absence of tendon reflexes

Audiometry for evidence of hearing loss, a critical differential point
