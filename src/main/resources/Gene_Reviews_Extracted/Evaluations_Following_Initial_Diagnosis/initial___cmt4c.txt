To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 4C (CMT4C), the following evaluations are recommended:

Examination by a child neurologist to evaluate for weakness and atrophy, gait stability, sensory loss, and other associated signs. It is important to distinguish between neuropathic pain and mechanical pain.

Examination by a pediatric orthopedist to assess the amount and progression of spinal curvature and to determine the extent of foot deformities

Examination by an otolaryngologist and/or ophthalmologist if problems with hearing or vision are present

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
