To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with X-linked centronuclear myopathy (XLCNM), the following evaluations are recommended:

Assessment of pulmonary function for long-term ventilatory management, either during initial hospitalization (if presentation at birth) or after the diagnosis has been established.

Ophthalmologic evaluation, either during initial hospitalization (if presentation at birth), or after the diagnosis has been established

In individuals with hemolysis or unexplained anemia, osmotic fragility test to detect spherocytosis

In the presence of infantile vomiting, investigation for pyloric stenosis

Baseline abdominal ultrasound examination to detect peliosis hepatis (although the specific risk for subsequent bleeding if peliosis is detected is not known)
