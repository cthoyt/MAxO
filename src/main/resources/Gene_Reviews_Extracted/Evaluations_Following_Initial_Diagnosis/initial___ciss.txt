To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with cold-induced sweating syndrome (CISS/Crisponi syndrome), the following evaluations are recommended:

Brain MRI. Usually normal, but may be done to evaluate for complicating features including a thin corpus callosum [Okur et al 2008] or small subcortical white matter lesions [Yamazaki et al 2010, Tüysüz et al 2013]

Swallowing tests and esophageal manometry. May be helpful in assessing the safety of oral feeding

EEG when seizures are observed or suspected

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
