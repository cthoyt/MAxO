Evaluation for cancer in an individual diagnosed with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) should be based on personal medical histories and to some extent, the specific pattern of cancer in the family. Testing can include comprehensive physical examination, neurologic examination, blood counts, imaging studies, endoscopies, and/or biopsies. Individuals diagnosed with or suspected of having LFS based on molecular or clinical criteria should seek a clinical genetics consultation to review the diagnosis and medical management recommendations.
