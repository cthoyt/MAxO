To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with a CHD2-related neurodevelopmental disorder, the following evaluations are recommended:

Neurologic examination including:

EEG, which may provide an assessment of the overall degree of epileptic encephalopathy and may lead to more focused use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs);

MRI, which is initially important to differentiate the genetic epilepsy from a lesional epilepsy and may lead to intensified conservative treatment rather than presurgical work up.

Developmental assessment

Clinical genetics and/or child neurology consultation
