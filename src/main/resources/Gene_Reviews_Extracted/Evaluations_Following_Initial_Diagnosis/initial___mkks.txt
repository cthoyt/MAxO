To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with McKusick-Kaufman Syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended:

Pelvic ultrasound examination to detect genitourinary malformations (Table 3)

Skeletal radiographs to detect osseous polydactyly and syndactyly

ECG and echocardiogram, to detect congenital heart defects

Renal ultrasound examination and a renal imaging study to detect pelvicalyceal abnormalities, renal hypoplasia, or cystic dysplasia of the kidneys

Assessment of height, weight, and head circumference and initiation of a carefully maintained growth chart to document obesity that may indicate Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS).

Determination of developmental status by standard screening tools to detect developmental delay that may indicate BBS. If delays are identified, a more detailed assessment of developmental and cognitive abilities is indicated.

Ophthalmologic examination and electroretinogram to evaluate for manifestations of BBS in children with weight greater than the 90th centile and/or short stature and/or developmental delay or intellectual disability.

Clinical genetics consultation
