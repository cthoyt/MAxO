To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with a hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma (PGL/PCC) syndrome, the following are recommended:

Imaging studies using MRI/CT, 123I-MIBG, and possibly PET to localize tumors and quantify the disease burden

Evaluation of individuals with extra-adrenal sympathetic paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas for blood pressure elevations, tachycardia, and other signs and symptoms of catecholamine hypersecretion that must be controlled prior to definitive therapy

Consideration of evaluation for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) in children, adolescents, or young adults who have unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., abdominal pain, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, nausea, vomiting, difficulty swallowing) or who experience unexplained intestinal obstruction or anemia [Pasini et al 2008]

Consideration of screening for renal cell carcinoma in individuals with SDHB pathogenic variants

Clinical genetics consultation
