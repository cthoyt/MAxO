To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with the branchiooculofacial syndrome (BOFS), the following studies are recommended:

CT imaging of the temporal bone to anticipate optimal hearing correction [Raveh et al 2000, Tekin et al 2009, Stoetzel et al 2009]

Echocardiogram if there is a murmur or cardiac symptoms

Renal ultrasonography

The following consultations are recommended:

Examination of the skin defects by a pediatric plastic surgeon to delineate the extent of the lesion(s), to determine if there is a sinus and, most importantly, to determine if a thymic remnant could be present

Formal evaluation of cleft lip/palate and other possible facial abnormalities by a cleft lip/palate team, which often includes a clinical geneticist, pediatric plastic surgeon, otorhinolaryngologist, speech and language therapist, dental and orthodontic specialist, and ophthalmologist

Complete eye examination by a pediatric ophthalmologist to assess for visual limitations, strabismus, and nasolacrimal duct obstruction

Referral of those with anophthalmia and/or severe microphthalmia to support services for the visually impaired

Referral to a nephrologist if renal abnormalities are identified

Referral to an audiologist

For those with a cleft, assessment by a speech therapist

Development assessment particularly for children with visual and/or hearing problems

Monitoring for depression, attention dysregulation

Note: Motor delays are not part of BOFS, and thus, physical and occupational therapy is not anticipated.
