To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with the primary autosomal recessive microcephalies (MCPH) and Seckel syndrome (SCKS) spectrum disorders, the following evaluations are recommended:

Neurology consultation

Age-adapted psychomotor or neuropsychological evaluation

Electroencephalogram if seizures are suspected

Review of brain MRI performed at the time of diagnosis to evaluate for malformations which can have a prognostic value in young children

If short stature is present, skeletal survey (if not performed at the time of diagnosis)
