To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with spinocerebellar ataxia type 13 (SCA13), the following evaluations are recommended:

Medical history

Neurologic examination

EEG

Formal neuropsychological tests for individuals with problems in learning and social adaptation

Speech pathology evaluation if dysarthria is atypical or severe enough to cause communication problems. For individuals with frequent choking or severe dysphagia, speech pathology evaluation may be important in assessing aspiration risks.
