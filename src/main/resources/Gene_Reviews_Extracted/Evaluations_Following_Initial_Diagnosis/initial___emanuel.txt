No current guidelines to evaluate the clinical manifestations that contribute to morbidity and mortality have been published. The following measures ‒ based on the literature and the authors' experience ‒ are recommended (if they have not already been completed) to establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Emanuel syndrome:

Palatal evaluation for cleft palate

Cardiac evaluation with an echocardiogram to screen for cardiac defects. Atrial septal defects are the most common defects and may not be detected by auscultation alone.

Renal ultrasound examination to evaluate for structural kidney anomalies; if indicated, vesicoureterogram (VCUG) to evaluate for vesicoureteral reflux

Gastrointestinal evaluation with appropriate radiologic studies for structural anomalies of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, in particular anal stenosis or diaphragmatic abnormalities, gastroesophageal reflux

Feeding and swallowing assessment

Orthopedic evaluation with appropriate radiologic studies for hip dysplasia as well as joint contractures, club foot, curvature of the spine, and radioulnar synostosis

Otolaryngology (ENT) evaluation for stenosis or atresia of ear canals

Audiology evaluation with auditory brain stem response testing and otoacoustic emission testing (See Hereditary Hearing Loss and Deafness for more information about this testing.)

Ophthalmologic evaluation including dilated fundoscopic examination to assess visual acuity and to evaluate for strabismus

Urologic evaluation in males with cryptorchidism and/or micropenis

Evaluation by a developmental pediatrician and therapists to develop educational/therapeutic intervention with emphasis on communication skills

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor for evaluation for genetic counseling and to identify at-risk relatives (The +der(22) is almost always inherited from a carrier parent.)
