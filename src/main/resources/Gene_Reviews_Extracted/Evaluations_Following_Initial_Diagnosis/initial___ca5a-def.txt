To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with carbonic anhydrase VA (CA-VA) deficiency, the following evaluations are recommended:

Measurement of serum lactate, plasma ammonia, serum glucose, blood gases, plasma amino acids, urine ketone bodies, and urine organic acid profiles (during periods of illness; when stable for monitoring, preferably fasting)

Liver function parameters (coagulation, albumin, AST, ALT) as acute liver failure can occur in the urea cycle disorders which are metabolically similar

Consideration of:

Brain MRI to define extent of or to exclude brain edema

Neurodevelopmental testing

Medical genetics consultation
