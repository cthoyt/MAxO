Evaluation of children with hypochondroplasia usually does not differ significantly from the evaluation of children with normal stature except for genetic counseling issues and dealing with parental concerns about short stature. However, because the phenotype of FGFR3 hypochondroplasia may overlap with that of achondroplasia, recommendations for the management of achondroplasia as outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Genetics [Trotter et al 2005] should be considered in children with hypochondroplasia who exhibit more severe phenotypic features. These recommendations include but are not limited to the following:

Medical genetics consultation

Measurement of height, weight, and head circumference and plotting on achondroplasia-standardized growth curves

Neurologic examination for signs of spinal cord compression, with referral to a pediatric neurologist or neurosurgeon if needed

Screening developmental assessment

History for evidence of sleep apnea, with formal sleep study if suggestive

MRI or CT examination of the foramen magnum if clinical findings of severe hypotonia, spinal cord compression, or central sleep apnea as demonstrated through a sleep study are present

Evaluation for thoracic or lumbar gibbus in the presence of truncal weakness

Examination for leg bowing, with orthopedic referral if bowing interferes with walking

Speech evaluation at diagnosis or by age two years

Observation for symptoms suggestive of epilepsy, with referral to a pediatric neurologist when indicated
