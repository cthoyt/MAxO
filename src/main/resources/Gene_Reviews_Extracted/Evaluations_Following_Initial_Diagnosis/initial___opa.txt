To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual with optic atrophy type 1 (OPA1), the following evaluations are recommended:

Assessment of visual acuity, color vision, and visual fields

Assessment of extraocular muscles (the affected individual is asked to follow the ophthalmoscope with his/her eyes without moving the head)

Hearing evaluation: auditory brain stem responses (ABRs), auditory evoked potentials (AEPs), and evoked otoacoustic emissions

Oral glucose tolerance test

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
