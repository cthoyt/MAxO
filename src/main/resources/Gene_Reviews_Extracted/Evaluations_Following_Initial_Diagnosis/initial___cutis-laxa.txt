To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with ATP6V0A2-related cutis laxa, the following evaluations are recommended:

Ortolani sign for detection of hip dislocation. Hip ultrasound examination as needed based on clinical findings.

Pelvic x-ray (1x only) to identify hip dysplasia in the event that hip dislocation has not been treated properly.

Assessment for inguinal hernias

Ophthalmologic examination, including refraction (for myopia), slit-lamp examination, fundus examination. Note: Slit-lamp examination allows diagnosis of corneal dysplasia, which was present in one individual.

Baseline neurodevelopmental evaluation

Brain MRI

EEG if seizures are suspected

Echocardiogram to look for evidence of floppy valves or more severe valvular dysplasia that can often be observed in a connective tissue disorder

Evaluation for a bleeding disorder linked to coagulation factor deficiencies

Clinical genetics consultation
