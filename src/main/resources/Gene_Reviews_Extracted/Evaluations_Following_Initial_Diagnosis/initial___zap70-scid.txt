The care of individuals diagnosed with ZAP70-related CID is best managed with a multidisciplinary team of providers including hematology/oncology/bone marrow transplantation, immunology, genetics, and infectious disease specialists. To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with ZAP70-related combined immunodeficiency (CID), the following evaluations are recommended:

Assessment of growth

Evaluation for common and opportunistic viral, bacterial, and fungal disease-causing agents

Complete metabolic panel (liver and renal function), complete blood count (CBC) with differential and platelet count, lymphocyte subsets and mitogen proliferation, and quantitative immunoglobulins

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Consultation with a clinical immunologist

Consultation for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
