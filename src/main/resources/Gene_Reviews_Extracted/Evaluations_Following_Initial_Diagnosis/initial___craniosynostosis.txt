To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with FGFR-related craniosynostosis, the following evaluations are recommended:

Assessment for hydrocephalus by brain CT or MRI in all cases of syndromic craniosynostosis, with close observation in those with pathogenic variants known to cause a more severe phenotype

Assessment for upper-airway obstruction or tracheal sleeve (in FGFR2-related Pfeiffer syndrome)

Assessment for exposure keratopathy

Spinal x-rays to evaluate for vertebral anomalies

Imaging of the gastrointestinal system in individuals with Pfeiffer or Apert syndrome for intestinal malrotation or esophageal atresia
