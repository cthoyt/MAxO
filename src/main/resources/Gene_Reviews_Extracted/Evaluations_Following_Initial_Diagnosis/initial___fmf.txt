To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), the following evaluations are recommended:

Physical examination to assess joint problems

Urinalysis for the presence of protein. If proteinuria is found, further evaluation is required including measurement of 24-hour urinary protein, renal function tests, and consider a rectal biopsy for the presence of amyloid.

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
