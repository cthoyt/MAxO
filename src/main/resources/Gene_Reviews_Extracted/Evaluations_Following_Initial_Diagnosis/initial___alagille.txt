To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Alagille syndrome (ALGS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Evaluation by a gastroenterologist, including a full set of liver function tests, clotting studies and if necessary, serum bile acids, fat-soluble vitamin levels, a hepatic ultrasound, a technitium-99m-DISIDA scintiscan, and liver biopsy

A full cardiac evaluation, including echocardiogram

AP and lateral chest radiographs to evaluate for the presence of butterfly vertebrae

An ophthalmologic examination to identify anterior chamber involvement

Renal function testing and renal ultrasound examination (especially in the newborn period)

Screening developmental evaluation, with more detailed evaluation if significant delays are identified

Measurement of growth parameters and plotting on age-appropriate growth charts

Medical genetics consultation
