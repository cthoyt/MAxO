To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with a MECP2-related disorder, the following evaluations should be considered:

Formal developmental assessment

Assessment of feeding/eating, digestive problems (including constipation and gastroesophageal reflux), and nutrition using history, growth measurements and, if needed, gastrointestinal investigations

History of sleep and/or breathing problems

Video/EEG monitoring to obtain definitive information about the occurrence of seizures and the need for antiepileptic drugs

Screening for prolonged QTc by ECG and Holter monitoring

Consider assessment of brain stem autonomic dysfunction to identify appropriate therapies, although this remains controversial [Julu et al 2001, Julu & Witt Engerstr√∂m 2005]

Examination for scoliosis

Clinical genetics consultation
