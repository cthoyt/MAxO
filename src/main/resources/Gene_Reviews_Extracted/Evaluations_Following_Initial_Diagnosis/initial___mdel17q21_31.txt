To establish the clinical consequences in an individual diagnosed with KANSL1-related intellectual disability syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended:

Multidisciplinary developmental evaluation, including feeding assessment

Comprehensive speech/language evaluation including audiologic examination

A renal ultrasound examination

Cardiac evaluation for possible heart anomalies including septal defect and aortic dilatation

Brain imaging studies in individuals with microcephaly and/or seizures

If seizures are suspected, EEG and consultation with a neurologist

Consideration of a Chiari malformation type 1 in individuals with the KANSL1-related intellectual disability syndrome presenting suggestive symptoms (headache, neck pain, cerebellar signs or muscle weakness) [Terrone et al 2012]

Investigation of growth hormone deficiency in individuals with KANSL1-related intellectual disability syndrome and short stature, defined by a height below - 2 SD scores for age and sex

Involvement of a clinical geneticist following the initial diagnosis
