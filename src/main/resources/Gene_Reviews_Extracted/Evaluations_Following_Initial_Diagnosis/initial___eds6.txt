To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), kyphoscoliotic form, the following evaluations are recommended:

Musculoskeletal

Evaluation for kyphoscoliosis. Photographic and radiologic documentation of the spine is recommended in view of the progressive kyphoscoliosis.

Physical therapy evaluation to develop a plan for ongoing therapy to strengthen large muscle groups and prevent recurrent shoulder dislocation

Cardiovascular. Measurement of aortic root size and assessment of heart valves by echocardiogram at the time of diagnosis or by age five years

Ophthalmologic. Formal ophthalmologic evaluation at diagnosis for myopia, astigmatism, and potential for retinal detachment

Medical genetics consultation
