To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Sotos syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended [Tatton-Brown & Rahman 2007]:

A thorough history to identify known features of Sotos syndrome: learning difficulties, cardiac and renal anomalies, seizures, and scoliosis

Physical examination including cardiac auscultation, blood pressure measurement, and back examination for scoliosis

Investigations to detect abnormalities before they result in significant morbidity/mortality:

In children in whom the diagnosis has just been established, echocardiogram and renal ultrasound examination

In adults in whom the diagnosis has just been established, renal ultrasound examination to evaluate for renal damage from quiescent chronic vesicoureteral reflux

Referral for audiologic assessment. Conductive hearing loss may occur at an increased frequency in Sotos syndrome; thus, the threshold for referral should be low.

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
