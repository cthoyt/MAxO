To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with infantile malignant CLCN7-related autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (ARO), the following evaluations are recommended:

Full blood cell count to evaluate for leukocytosis or leukocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia with low reticulocyte count

Investigation of calcium concentrations in blood and urine to evaluate for hypocalcemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism

Ultrasonography of abdomen to evaluate for hepatosplenomegaly

MRI and/or CT of the neurocranium to evaluate for narrowed neuroforamina, hydrocephalus, and brain abnormalities in neuronopathic form of osteopetrosis

Ophthalmologic examination including VEPs to evaluate for optic nerve atrophy

Otorhinolaryngologic examination to evaluate for choanal stenosis

EEG to detect pathologic changes associated with neurodegeneration; neurologic examination to evaluate development

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
