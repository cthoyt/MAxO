To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with fatty acid hydroxylase-associated neurodegeneration (FAHN), the following evaluations may be useful:

Neurologic examination for dystonia, ataxia, and spasticity, including formal evaluation of ambulation, speech, and feeding

Ophthalmologic assessment for evidence of optic atrophy or eye movement abnormalities

Screening developmental assessment, with referral for more formal testing if delay is indicated

Assessment for physical therapy, occupational therapy, and/or speech therapy and appropriate assistive devices
