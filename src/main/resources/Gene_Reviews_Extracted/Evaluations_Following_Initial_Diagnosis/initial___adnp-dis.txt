To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with ADNP-related intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders (ADNP-related ID/ASD), the following evaluations are recommended:

Physical examination to assess hypotonia, joint laxity, and obesity

Anamnestic interview focusing on sleep problems and feeding difficulties

Neurologic evaluation, including EEG if seizures are suspected, and brain MRI to detect brain abnormalities (if not performed as part of the diagnostic evaluation)

In infants and children, comprehensive developmental assessment including gross and fine motor skills and speech and language; evaluation for autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability

Psychiatric evaluation if behavioral problems are present

Ophthalmologic examination and vision assessment, including electrophysiologic and visual perception examination to detect cortical visual impairment

Ultrasound of the heart to evaluate for cardiac anomalies

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
