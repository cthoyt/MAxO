To establish the extent of disease and management requirements in an individual diagnosed with Fanconi anemia (FA), the following evaluations are recommended:

Evaluation by a hematologist, to include complete blood count, fetal hemoglobin, full blood typing, blood chemistries (assessing liver, kidney, and iron status), and bone marrow aspirate for cell morphology, FISH and cytogenetics, as well as biopsy for cellularity

Note: The bone marrow of individuals with FA can exhibit signs of dysplasia, such as nuclear/cytoplasmic dys-synchrony, hypo-lobulated megakaryocytes, and bi-nucleated erythroid cells. These features must be distinguished from true forms of MDS by a hematopathologist experienced in the evaluation of MDS in individuals with FA.

HLA typing of the affected individual, sibs, and parents for consideration of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation

Examination by an ophthalmologist

Ultrasound examination of the kidneys and urinary tract

Formal hearing evaluation

Echocardiogram

Referral to an endocrinologist

Developmental assessment (particularly important for toddlers and school-age children)

Referrals as indicated to an otolaryngologist, hand surgeon, gastroenterologist, gynecologist, and urologist

Evaluation by a clinical geneticist and genetic counseling
