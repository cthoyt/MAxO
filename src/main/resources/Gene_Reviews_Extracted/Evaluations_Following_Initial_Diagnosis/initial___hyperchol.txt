To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) the following evaluations are recommended in adults and children:

Measurement of pre-treatment lipid values and lipoprotein(a) levels when possible

Exclusion of concurrent illnesses (kidney disease, acute myocardial infarction, infection) that can affect lipid values

Lipid panel including total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides

Consultation with a lipid specialist or clinician with expertise in FH

Recommended in some guidelines: noninvasive imaging modalities in children (e.g., measurement of carotid intima-media thickness) to help inform treatment decisions [Martin et al 2013]

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
