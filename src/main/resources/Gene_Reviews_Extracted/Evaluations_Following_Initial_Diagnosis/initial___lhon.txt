To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), the following evaluations are recommended:

Measurement of best corrected visual acuity

Assessment of visual fields with static or kinetic perimetry

ECG. Although a relatively rare finding, an ECG may reveal a pre-excitation syndrome in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals who have a LHON-causing mtDNA variant. Even when present, such an ECG finding does not necessitate further intervention in the absence of cardiac symptoms.

Screening for possible associated neurologic complications, which can further compound the visual impairment among individuals with LHON

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
