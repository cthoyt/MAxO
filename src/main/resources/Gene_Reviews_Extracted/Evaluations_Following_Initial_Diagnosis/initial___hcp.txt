To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), the following evaluations are recommended in an individual with acute abdominal symptoms:

Review of medications for those that are thought to induce attacks (See Agents/Circumstances to Avoid.)

Detailed neurologic examination for signs of motor neuropathy (which indicates a more advanced attack and, therefore, the need for early treatment with hematin)

Inquiry into possibility of seizures

Measurement of serum sodium concentration. Hyponatremia is characteristic and may be profound (serum sodium concentration <110 mEq/L), requiring urgent correction with due regard for the risk of central pontine myelinolysis.

Quantitation of urinary excretion of porphobilinogen (PBG) on several occasions over a few months to establish a baseline for future use in determining if a new symptom or drug reaction is due to an acute attack (In an acute attack urinary excretion of PBG is substantially elevated over the baseline.)

Clinical genetics consultation
