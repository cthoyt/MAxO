Because of the increased incidence of a second thrombophilic defect among symptomatic individuals with inherited thrombophilia [Emmerich et al 2001], individuals heterozygous or homozygous for the F2

20210G>A allele should be tested for other inherited and acquired thrombophilic disorders in order to evaluate the risk for thrombosis. Testing should include:

An activated protein C resistance or DNA assay for factor V Leiden;

Serologic assays for anticardiolipin antibodies and anti-beta 2 glycoprotein 1 antibodies;

Multiple phospholipid-dependent coagulation assays for a lupus inhibitor.

Note: Testing for antiphospholipid antibodies should include assays for all three antibodies (anticardiolipin antibodies, anti-beta2 glycoprotein 1 antibodies, and lupus inhibitors) since only 50% of individuals with the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome have more than one type of antibody.

Evaluation of high-risk individuals (i.e., those with a history of recurrent VTE especially at a young age, or those with strong family history of VTE at a young age), should also include assays of:

Protein C activity;

Antithrombin activity;

Protein S activity or free protein S antigen.

Note: In an evaluation for thrombophilia: (1) Measurement of plasma concentration of homocysteine is no longer recommended because no data support the use of vitamin supplementation or modification of the duration of anticoagulation in individuals with hyperhomocysteinemia and a history of VTE [den Heijer et al 2007]; (2) there is no clinical rationale for DNA testing for MTHFR variants; and (3) routine measurement of factor VIII and other clotting factor levels is not recommended; however, such testing may be useful in certain instances [Bauer 2010, Jenkins et al 2012]
