To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with PMM2-CDG (CDG-Ia) the following evaluations are recommended [Jaeken & Carchon 2001, Jaeken & Matthijs 2001, Grunewald et al 2002, Kjaergaard et al 2002, Miller & Freeze 2003, Gr√ºnewald 2009]:

Liver function tests

Measurement of serum albumin concentration

Thyroid function tests to evaluate for decreased thyroid binding globulin, elevated serum concentration of TSH, and low serum concentration of free T4

Coagulation studies including protein C, protein S, antithrombin III, and factor IX

Urinalysis to evaluate for proteinuria

Measurement of serum concentration of gonadotropins in adolescent and adult women to look for evidence of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism

Echocardiogram to evaluate for pericardial effusions

Renal ultrasound examination to evaluate for microcysts

Formal ophthalmologic evaluation since ocular anomalies are frequent and can involve both the structural components (development of the lens and retina) as well as ocular mobility and intraocular pressure [Morava et al 2009, Thompson et al 2013]

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor with inclusion in a multi-disciplinary team if needed
