To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with Russell-Silver syndrome (RSS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Assessment and plotting of growth curves. For European children, see Wollmann et al [1995]; for North American children, see the MAGIC Foundation.

Physical examination for evaluation of possible limb-size asymmetry and oral and craniofacial abnormalities

For most children with RSS, evaluation for growth hormone deficiency by standard methods

For children with diaphoresis, evaluation for hypoglycemia

For children suspected of having gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), evaluation for esophagitis including barium swallow studies, pH probe, and endoscopy

Screening assessment of neurocognitive development, language, and muscle tone
