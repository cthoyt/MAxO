To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Fryns syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended:

Chest and abdominal radiographs

Cranial ultrasound examination

Echocardiogram

Abdominal ultrasound examination

Examination for dysmorphic features and digital anomalies by a clinical geneticist

Depending on the clinical situation, further evaluation with a cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, a complete radiographic skeletal survey, and a detailed ophthalmologic examination should be considered to evaluate for other physical findings that could be present.
