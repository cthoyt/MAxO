To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Brugada syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended:

Electrocardiogram

Induction with sodium blockers (ajmaline, procainamide, pilsicainide, flecainide) in persons with a type 2 ECG or type 3 ECG and suspicion of the disease

Electrophysiologic study to assess risk of sudden cardiac death. Although the data are controversial, no other risk stratification parameter is presently available for asymptomatic individuals [Nunn et al 2010].

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
