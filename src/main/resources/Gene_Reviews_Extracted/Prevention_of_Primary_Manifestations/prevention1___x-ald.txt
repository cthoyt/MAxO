Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) ) is an option for boys and adolescents in early stages of symptom set 1 who have evidence of brain involvement on MRI.

Because HSCT is associated with a 20% risk for morbidity and mortality, it is recommended only for individuals with evidence of brain involvement by MRI but minimal neuropsychologic findings (performance IQ >80) and normal clinical neurologic examination.

HSCT is not recommended for individuals with severe neurologic and neuropsychologic dysfunction (i.e., performance IQ <80) [Shapiro et al 2000, Baumann et al 2003, Loes et al 2003, Peters et al 2004, Mahmood et al 2005, Resnick et al 2005].
