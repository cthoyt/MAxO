Prophylactic thyroidectomy is the primary preventive measure for individuals with an identified germline RET pathogenic variant [Cohen & Moley 2003, American Thyroid Association Guidelines Task Force 2009].

Prophylactic thyroidectomy is safe for all age groups; however, the timing of the surgery is controversial [Moley et al 1998]. According to the consensus statement from the American Thyroid Association Guidelines Task Force, the age at which prophylactic thyroidectomy is performed can be guided by the codon position of the RET pathogenic variant (Table 4, Genotype-Phenotype Correlations) [American Thyroid Association Guidelines Task Force 2009]. However, these guidelines continue to be modified as more data become available.

Thyroidectomy for C-cell hyperplasia, before progression to invasive MTC, may allow surgery to be limited to thyroidectomy with sparing of lymph nodes [Brandi et al 2001, Kahraman et al 2003].

For all individuals with a RET pathogenic variant who have not had a thyroidectomy, annual biochemical screening is recommended with immediate thyroidectomy if results are abnormal [Szinnai et al 2003].

Annual serum calcitonin screening [American Thyroid Association Guidelines Task Force 2009] should begin at age:

Six months for children with MEN 2B

Three to five years for children with MEN 2A or FMTC

Caution should be used in interpreting calcitonin results for children younger than age three years, especially those younger than age six months [American Thyroid Association Guidelines Task Force 2009].

Prophylactic thyroidectomy is not routinely offered to at-risk individuals in whom the disorder has not been confirmed.
