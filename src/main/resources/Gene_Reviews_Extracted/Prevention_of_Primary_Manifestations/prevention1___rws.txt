Beta blockers. Beta blockers are clinically indicated in all asymptomatic individuals, including those who have a pathogenic variant on molecular testing with a normal QTc interval [Priori et al 2004, Schwartz et al 2009]. Males who have a pathogenic variant and who have been asymptomatic before 40 years are at low risk of cardiac events. In these individuals the necessity of beta-blockers can be discussed [Locati et al 1998].

ICD. In general, ICD implantation is not indicated for asymptomatic individuals with LQTS who have not been tried on beta blocker therapy. Prophylactic ICD therapy can be considered for asymptomatic individuals suspected to be at very high risk, such as asymptomatic individuals with two or more pathogenic variants on molecular testing [Priori et al 2013]. LQTS-related sudden death in a close relative is not an indication for an ICD in surviving relatives [Kaufman et al 2008].
