Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Variable results have been reported with HSCT. Shah et al [2005] reported successful HSCT for NPD-A. Successful engraftment can correct the metabolic defect, improve blood counts, and reduce increased liver and spleen volumes. However, stabilization of the neurologic component following HSCT has not been reported; therefore, any attempts to perform HSCT in individuals with clinically evident neurologic disease should be considered experimental. The morbidity and mortality associated with HSCT limit its use.
