In generalized epimerase deficiency galactosemia dietary restriction of galactose/lactose prevents early feeding problems, vomiting, poor weight gain, hepatic dysfunction, and cataracts.

The challenge in treating an asymptomatic newborn with epimerase deficiency galactosemia is that it may take months to obtain the results of tests used to distinguish peripheral epimerase deficiency galactosemia from intermediate epimerase deficiency galactosemia (see Establishing the Diagnosis, Additional Testing); furthermore, such tests may not be available. The most conservative approach, therefore, is to advise dietary restriction of galactose/lactose for all infants with epimerase deficiency galactosemia, relaxing the restriction as warranted once a more accurate diagnosis has been confirmed.
