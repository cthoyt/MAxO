Most of the primary manifestations of GSD III can be diminished or avoided with good metabolic (dietary) control.

When euglycemia is maintained and ketosis is avoided, hepatomegaly regresses and other abnormal laboratory values (e.g., elevated AST and ALT, increased serum concentration of triglycerides) normalize or come close to baseline [Bernier et al 2008].

Myopathy and cardiomyopathy may be partially avoided by good dietary control. New evidence suggests that skeletal muscle metabolism is impaired during exercise in GSD III. Consumption of fructose or sucrose prior to exercise may improve exercise tolerance, but does not completely prevent exercise-induced damage [Preisler et al 2015].
