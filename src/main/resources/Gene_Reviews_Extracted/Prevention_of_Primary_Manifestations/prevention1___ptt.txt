In the absence of a history of thrombosis, long-term anticoagulation is not recommended for asymptomatic 20210G>A heterozygotes, since the 1%-3% yearly risk for major bleeding from warfarin is greater than the estimated (<1%) yearly risk for thrombosis [Martinelli et al 2000a, Middeldorp & van Hylckama Vlieg 2008, Berg et al 2011].

Prophylactic anticoagulation may be considered in high-risk clinical settings such as surgery, pregnancy, or prolonged immobilization, although currently no evidence confirms the benefit of primary prophylaxis for asymptomatic 20210G>A heterozygotes. Factors that may influence decisions about the indication for and duration of anticoagulation include age, family history, and other coexisting risk factors. Recommendations for prophylaxis at the time of surgery and other high-risk situations are available in the 2012 American College of Chest Physicians consensus guidelines [Guyatt et al 2012] (full text).
