Beta-blockers are indicated for primary prevention in all clinically affected individuals (see Treatment of Manifestations) and in individuals with pathogenic variants in the genes associated with CPVT who have a negative exercise stress test (class IIa). Recommended drugs are nadolol (1-2.5 mg/kg/day) or propranolol (2-4 mg/kg/day). For symptomatic individuals with CPVT, the maximum tolerated dosage should be maintained. Flecainide can be added for primary prevention of cardiac arrest when beta-blockers alone cannot control the onset of arrhythmias during exercise stress test.
