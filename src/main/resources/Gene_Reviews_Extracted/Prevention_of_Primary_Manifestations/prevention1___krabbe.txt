Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in presymptomatic infants [Escolar et al 2005] and older individuals with mild symptoms [Krivit et al 1998] provides a benefit over symptomatic treatment only. Treated individuals show improved and preserved cognitive function; however, many show progressive deterioration of peripheral nervous system findings.

The availability of suitable donors has changed considerably with the use of umbilical cord blood for HSCT.

The identification of newborns with the potential to develop Krabbe disease by newborn screening (presently in place in New York State) facilitates the initiation of treatment before neurologic damage has occurred. Concerns remain regarding the age at which to start treatment, prediction of clinical course without treatment, and long-term consequences of treatment.

Given the significant clinical variability among individuals with late-onset forms (even those with the same genotype), evaluation of treatment effectiveness is difficult.
