For individuals with TS-NSAN:

Prevent febrile episodes.

Avoid the level of exercise and/or ambient conditions that would cause body temperature to rise.

Treat febrile episodes as quickly as possible to return body temperature to normal.

Educate individuals and their caregivers that the onset of hearing loss may be the first sign of a pyretic/infectious event requiring treatment [Starr et al 1998]. Appropriate precautions including avoidance of potentially dangerous or noisy situations should be encouraged.
