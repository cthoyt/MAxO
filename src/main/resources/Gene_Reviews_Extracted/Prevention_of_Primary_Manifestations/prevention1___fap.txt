Colectomy is advised to reduce the risk for colorectal cancer in FAP. For individuals with attenuated FAP, colectomy may be necessary, but in approximately one third of individuals, the colonic polyps are limited enough in number that surveillance with periodic colonoscopic polypectomy is sufficient to prevent colorectal cancer. Colonoscopy can therefore be utilized for surveillance, as well as prevention of colorectal cancer.

To reduce the risk for duodenal/periampullary adenocarcinoma, endoscopic or surgical removal of duodenal and/or ampullary adenomas should be considered if polyps exhibit villous change or severe dysplasia, exceed one centimeter in diameter, or cause symptoms.
