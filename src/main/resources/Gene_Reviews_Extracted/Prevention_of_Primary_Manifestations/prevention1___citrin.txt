To prevent hyperammonemia and improve growth, a diet rich in protein and lipids and low in carbohydrates is recommended [Saheki & Kobayashi 2005, Saheki et al 2006, Dimmock et al 2007, Saheki et al 2008, Dimmock et al 2009].

High-carbohydrate meals and alcohol should be avoided.

Arginine administration may be effective in preventing hyperammonemic crises.
