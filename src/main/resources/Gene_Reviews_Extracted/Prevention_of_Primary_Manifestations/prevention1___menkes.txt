Menkes disease. In classic Menkes disease, treatment with subcutaneous injections of copper histidine or copper chloride before age ten days normalizes developmental outcome in some individuals and improves the neurologic outcome in others [Kaler et al 2008, Kaler et al 2010].

Note: Despite very early copper histidine treatment, some infants show no significant improvement relative to the natural history of untreated Menkes disease [Kaler et al 1995, Kaler et al 2008]. The type and severity of the ATP7A pathogenic variant determine the response to early copper treatment.

To maintain serum copper concentration in the normal range (70-150 µg/dL), the suggested dose of copper chloride is:

For children age <1 year: 250 µg administered subcutaneously 2x/day

For children age >1 year: 250 µg administered subcutaneously 1x/day

Occipital horn syndrome. Although there is no evidence that copper replacement therapy for OHS is clinically beneficial, it would be reasonable to expect even better overall neurodevelopmental and neurocognitive outcomes if individuals with OHS were identified early and treated with copper during their first three years.
