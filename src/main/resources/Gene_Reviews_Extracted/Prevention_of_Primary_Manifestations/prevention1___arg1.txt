The goal should be maintenance of plasma arginine concentration as near normal as possible, consistent with the individual's tolerance for the following interventions:

Restriction of dietary protein through use of specialized formulas. In the best of circumstances, the affected individual should be on the minimal protein intake needed to maintain protein biosynthetic function, growth, and normal or near-normal plasma amino acid concentrations. Half or more of dietary protein should be an arginine-free essential amino acid mixture.

Administration of oral nitrogen scavenging drugs. Sodium phenylbutyrate/glycerolphenylbutyrate at a dose of 350-600 mg/kg/day in patients weighing less than 20 kg, or 9.9-13.0 g/m2/day in larger patients. The medicines are to be taken in equally divided amounts with each meal or feeding (i.e., 3-6x/day) [De Deyn et al 1997, Iyer et al 1998, Urea Cycle Disorders Consortium].

Liver transplantation eliminates the hyperargininemia and presumably the risk for hyperammonemia.
