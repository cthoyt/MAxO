Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTX). The only effective therapy for the neuropathy of familial TTR amyloidosis is orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTX), which removes the main production site of the amyloidogenic protein. Successful OLTX results in rapid disappearance of variant TTR protein from the serum and thus halts the progression of peripheral and/or autonomic neuropathy. It has been shown by pre- and postoperative sural nerve biopsy that myelinated nerve fibers regenerate after OLTX [Ikeda et al 1997].

Recommended clinical criteria for OLTX in individuals with TTR amyloid polyneuropathy [Takei et al 1999, Adams et al 2000] include the following:

Age younger than 60 years

Disease duration less than five years

Either polyneuropathy that is restricted to the lower extremities or autonomic neuropathy alone

No significant cardiac or renal dysfunction

As of the end of June 2010, 1913 individuals with familial TTR amyloidosis, approximately 90% of whom were heterozygous for the Val30Met variant, had undergone liver transplantation (www.fapwtr.org/ram_fap.htm) [Ericzon et al 2000, Ikeda et al 2003, Herlenius et al 2004, Stangou & Hawkins 2004]. The five-year survival rate was significantly higher in individuals with the Val30Met variant than in those with other pathogenic variants (80% vs 57%, p=0.001) [Ericzon et al 2000, Ikeda et al 2003]. The most common causes of postoperative death were cardiovascular events (29%) and septicemia (26%) [Ikeda et al 2003].

Poor outcomes of transplanted individuals based on ten years' experience [Ikeda et al 2003] include:

Poor nutritional condition (mean body mass index <600)

Severe polyneuropathy (Norris score <55/81)

Permanent urinary incontinence

Marked postural hypotension

A fixed pulse rate

OLTX is not effective in the non-neuropathic forms of familial TTR amyloidosis (i.e., cardiac amyloidosis, leptomeningeal amyloidosis, and familial oculoleptomeningeal amyloidosis [FOLMA]).

Cardiomyopathy was reported to progress after OLTX in some individuals with specific pathogenic variants other than Val30Met (Ala36Pro, Glu42Gly, and Ser77Tyr) (see Table 5) [Dubrey et al 1997, Stangou et al 1998, Yazaki et al 2000, Hörnsten et al 2004]. It is presumed that amyloid cardiomyopathy may accelerate after OLTX by progressive deposition of wild-type TTR on a template of amyloid derived from variant TTR [Yazaki et al 2000, Hörnsten et al 2004]. Therefore, it is critical to assess the severity of cardiac amyloidosis when considering OLTX [Coutinho et al 2004, Juneblad et al 2004].

Individuals with leptomeningeal involvement may not be candidates for liver transplantation because amyloidogenic TTR variants that cause intracranial amyloid deposits are considered to be derived from the choroid plexus.

Vitreous opacities may also progress after OLTX, possibly as the result of de novo production of variant TTR in the retinal epithelium.

Note: Because liver involvement in familial TTR amyloidosis is minimal, the liver of an individual with familial TTR amyloidosis can be grafted into an individual with liver cancer or end-stage liver disease (so-called "domino" liver transplantation). Since 1995, more than 330 domino liver transplantations have been performed. Several individuals who had received a liver graft from heterozygotes with familial TTR amyloidosis developed symptomatic systemic TTR amyloidosis [Stangou et al 2005, Goto et al 2006, Barreiros et al 2010, Lladó et al 2010, Obayashi et al 2011, Adams et al 2011]
