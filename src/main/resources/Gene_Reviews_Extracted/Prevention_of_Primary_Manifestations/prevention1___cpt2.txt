Appropriate measures include the following:

Infusions of glucose during intercurrent infections to prevent catabolism

Note: Oral glucose cannot achieve this effect.

High-carbohydrate (70%) and low-fat (<20%) diet to provide fuel for glycolysis

Frequent meals and avoidance of extended fasting

Avoidance of prolonged exercise and other known triggers
