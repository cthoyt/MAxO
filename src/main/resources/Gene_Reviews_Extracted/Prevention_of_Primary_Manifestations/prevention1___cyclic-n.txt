Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is effective in elevating blood neutrophil counts in both congenital neutropenia and cyclic neutropenia. G-CSF treatment ameliorates the symptoms and problems of infections in almost all affected individuals. (Although both G-CSF and GM-CSF have been used to treat ELANE-related neutropenia, G-CSF is much more effective and associated with fewer adverse effects than GM-CSF.)

In cyclic neutropenia, G-CSF shortens the periods of neutropenia as well as the length of the neutropenic cycle. Treatment is known to be effective at least as early as age six months to one year. Studies indicate that treatment is effective with no adverse effects on growth, development, or pregnancy outcome with follow-up to age 18 years [Dale et al 2003; Dale, unpublished observations].

Treatment of cyclic neutropenia requires daily or alternate-day injections of G-CSF, normally in a dose of approximately 2 µg/kg/day. Individuals with congenital neutropenia often require higher doses (e.g., 5-10 µg/kg/day).

Common side effects of G-CSF include bone pain and headache, splenomegaly, and osteoporosis. Vasculitis, rashes, arthralgias, and glomerulonephritis have been infrequently reported [Dale et al 2003].

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)

For affected individuals with a well-matched donor, HSCT may be the preferred treatment option [Choi & Levine 2010, Oshima et al 2010].

HSCT is the only alternative therapy for individuals with congenital neutropenia who are refractory to high-dose G-CSF or who undergo malignant transformation.
