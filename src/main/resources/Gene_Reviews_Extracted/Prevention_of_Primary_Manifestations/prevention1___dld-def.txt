No compelling evidence exists for the prevention of acute episodes, despite multiple attempted dietary strategies and medications. The frequency of acute episodes decreases with age in most patients with DLD deficiency.

Although no specific therapy exists to prevent the neurologic dysfunction and/or the hepatic manifestations of DLD deficiency, avoidance of precipitating factors is recommended. As such, empiric recommendations include the following:

Provide protein intake at or around RDA and titrate based on growth and plasma amino acid values. See MSUD for the recommended intake and target levels of leucine, isoleucine, and valine.

Supplement with levocarnitine if deficient.

Avoid fasting, catabolic states, and extremes of dietary intake until dietary tolerance/stressors are identified.

Avoid liver-toxic medications.
