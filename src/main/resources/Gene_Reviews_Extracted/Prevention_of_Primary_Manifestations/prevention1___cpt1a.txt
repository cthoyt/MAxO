A high-carbohydrate diet (70% of calories) that is low in fat (<20% of calories) is generally recommended to provide a constant supply of carbohydrate energy, particularly during illness. Restriction of dietary fat intake is somewhat controversial when affected individuals are well. If the physician chooses to recommend a low-fat diet when the affected individual is well, supplementation with essential fatty acids is necessary.

Provision of approximately one third of total calories as medium-chain triglycerides is recommended during periods of illness. C6-C10 fatty acids do not require the carnitine shuttle for entry into the mitochondrion.

Frequent feeding is recommended, particularly for infants, given their limited glycogen reserves. Cornstarch feedings given overnight provide a constant source of slow-release carbohydrate to prevent hypoglycemia during sleep.

Older children should not fast for more than 12 hours and for a shorter time if evidence of a febrile or gastrointestinal illness exists.

Adults should be aware of the risks of fasting and they and their primary care physician should be aware of the risks during surgery when both metabolic stress and fasting occur.

Brief hospital admission for administration of intravenous dextrose-containing fluid should be considered in individuals with known CPT1A deficiency who are required to fast more than 12 hours because of illness or surgical or medical procedures.
