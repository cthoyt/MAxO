Medications that reduce hemodynamic stress on the aortic wall, such as beta-blockers, are routinely prescribed. This therapy should be managed by a cardiologist or geneticist familiar with its use. Therapy is generally initiated at the time of diagnosis with Marfan syndrome at any age or upon appreciation of progressive aortic root dilatation even in the absence of a definitive diagnosis. The dose needs to be titrated to effect, keeping heart rate after submaximal exercise or agitation lower than 110 in young children or lower than 100 in older children or adults.

Verapamil or other calcium channel blockers have been suggested if beta-blockers cannot be used (e.g., in individuals with asthma) or are not tolerated (e.g., prolonged lethargy, depression). Data documenting either the efficacy or safety of this approach in people with Marfan syndrome are very limited.

Yetman et al [2005] suggested that use of ACE inhibitors may be more beneficial than beta-blockers. Of note, the treatments were not randomized and the dose of beta-blocker was not titrated to effect. ACE inhibitors have been used for decades in Marfan syndrome to manage volume overload resulting from valve dysfunction, and (unlike beta-blockers) have not previously been reported to provide notable protection from progressive aortic enlargement.

There is at least some theoretic concern that reducing afterload without a concomitant reduction in inotropy (as provided by a beta-blocker) could increase hemodynamic stress in the ascending aorta. Currently, afterload-reducing agents are only commonly used in conjunction with a beta-blocker to manage volume overload in the setting of valve dysfunction.
