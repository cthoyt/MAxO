Hb Bart syndrome

Because of the severity of Hb Bart syndrome and the risk for maternal complications during the pregnancy with a fetus with this disorder, prenatal diagnosis and early termination of affected pregnancies is usually considered. Future studies on the functional outcomes of children with Hb Bart syndrome who have received chronic transfusion, intrauterine transfusions, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant, will allow physicians to improve the informed decision-making process for families weighing the risk-benefit profile of present treatment options.
