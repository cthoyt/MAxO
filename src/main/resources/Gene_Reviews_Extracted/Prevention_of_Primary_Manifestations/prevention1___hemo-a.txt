Prophylactic treatment is recommended by the National Hemophilia Foundation and the World Federation of Hemophilia for children with severe hemophilia and is usually administered as infusions of factor VIII concentrate three times a week or every other day to maintain factor VIII clotting activity above 1%, although a less intense regimen may provide protection for some affected boys [Fischer et al 2002, Feldman et al 2006]. Newer modified recombinant products with longer half-lives allow less frequent infusions.

Factor VIII concentrate infusions given prophylactically in young boys before or just after their first few joint bleeds can nearly eliminate spontaneous bleeding and prevent chronic joint disease [Manco-Johnson et al 2007].

The greatest benefit is seen in affected individuals who start therapy before age 2.5 to three years. Routine prophylaxis begun later in childhood or in adults significantly decreases bleeding episodes [Valentino et al 2012, Manco-Johnson et al 2013, Mondorf et al 2013].

"Secondary" prophylaxis, started after some joint damage has occurred, can be given on a long-term basis or around periods of increased activity or surgical procedures. An increasing number of adults with hemophilia are on long-term prophylaxis and clinical benefit is being documented in short- and long-term studies.
