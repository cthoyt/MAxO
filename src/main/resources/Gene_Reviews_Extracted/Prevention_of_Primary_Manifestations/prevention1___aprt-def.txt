Adequate treatment of APRT deficiency with allopurinol (or febuxostat in those who are allergic to or intolerant of allopurinol) prevents kidney stone formation and the development of CKD in most, if not all, individuals with the disorder [Edvardsson et al 2001, Boll√©e et al 2010, Harambat et al 2012]. Therefore, all affected individuals should receive lifelong treatment with allopurinol (or febuxostat).
