Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis 



To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with Bietti crystalline dystrophy (BCD), the following evaluations are recommended:

Fundoscopic examination

Full-field electroretinogram (ffERG) to establish a baseline

Visual field testing (perimetry) to evaluate the degree of visual field constriction or presence of scotomas and to establish a baseline

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) to evaluate for complications such as choroidal neovascularization (CNV) or macular hole formation

Medical genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations



No treatment for BCD currently exists; affected individuals should be referred to services specific to those with vision impairment:

Low vision specialists can prescribe low vision aids/devices to help optimize remaining vision.

State services for the Blind or organizations/professionals trained to work with the visually impaired provide access to services related to employment, education, and counseling regarding the psychosocial adaptation to visual loss

Note: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is uncommon in BCD. Laser photocoagulation is not usually considered for CNV in inherited forms of retinal degeneration and has recently been superseded by the use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy in a fashion similar to its use in age-related macular dystrophy.

Surveillance



Ophthalmologic examination is recommended every one to two years to monitor disease progression. Examination should include visual field testing particularly as it relates to determination of driving eligibility and eligibility for government programs and/or disability.

Patients should be aware of the possibility of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and the option of self-monitoring using an Amsler grid under direction of their primary care ophthalmologist.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk



See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Therapies Under Investigation
