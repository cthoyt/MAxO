Early diagnosis of NPS in at-risk family members allows for ophthalmologic and renal screening, especially in individuals with mild-moderate skeletal involvement who may not otherwise come to clinical attention. Molecular genetic testing can be used if the pathogenic variant in the family is known; otherwise, monitor renal findings (i.e., blood pressure, urinalysis, and urine albumin:creatinine ratio on a first-morning urine) and screen for glaucoma.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management 

Renal problems may present during (or be exacerbated by) pregnancy and in one study 29% of pregnant women with NPS developed preeclampsia [Sweeney et al 2003]. Hence, frequent urinalysis and blood pressure measurement is recommended in pregnant women with NPS. Medication used to treat renal disease, such as ACE inhibitors, should be reviewed ideally prior to pregnancy, or at least as soon as pregnancy is recognized, so that transition to an alternative treatment can be considered in order to avoid potential adverse effects of ACE inhibitors on the developing fetus.
