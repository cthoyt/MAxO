Some families with one child with Duarte variant galactosemia wish to evaluate their other children for Duarte variant galactosemia; however, it has not been established that avoidance of all sources of milk and dairy products is warranted in any siblings who test positive for Duarte variant galactosemia.

If the GALT genotype of the proband is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs: sibs can be tested for the presence of the D2 allele and the specific GALT pathogenic variant identified in the proband.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

There are no known additional risks associated with pregnancy for a woman with Duarte variant galactosemia or for a fetus with Duarte variant galactosemia.
