It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk male and female relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment (ERT) and preventive measures.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant in the family is known.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known:

Males. Measure α-Gal A enzyme activity.

Females. Measurement of α-Gal A enzyme activity is unreliable in females although demonstration of decreased α-Gal A enzyme activity is diagnostic of the heterozygous state. Ophthalmologic examination for the characteristic whorl-like corneal opacities by slit-lamp microscopy can be considered if enzyme analysis is uninformative. However, only 80%-90% of heterozygous females have the corneal lesions.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
