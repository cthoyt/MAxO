If the germline DICER1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, it is reasonable to offer molecular genetic testing to at-risk relatives of all ages to clarify their genetic status and to provide recommendations for age-appropriate surveillance and early intervention.

If first-degree relatives are not able to undergo molecular genetic testing, surveillance should be based on clinical changes that would warrant further investigation as detailed above (see Surveillance).

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Although large lung cysts in the fetus can theoretically impair lung development, such an occurrence appears to be uncommon. According to the IPPBR, prenatal ultrasound examination has detected lung cysts in seven cases at 31-35 weeksâ€™ gestational age.

Because large lung cysts can cause respiratory distress in newborns, it is recommended that prenatal identification of lung cysts prompt consultation with specialists in high-risk obstetrics and fetal medicine to monitor the pregnancy and manage the delivery.
