Pregnancy Management

Although no formal studies have been performed, no evidence from clinical practice suggests that fetuses affected with CADASIL are at an increased risk for intrauterine complications or complications during/after delivery.

Women with a NOTCH3 pathogenic variant have been described as at increased risk for neurologic events in pregnancy during and shortly after delivery (puerperium) [Roine et al 2005]. However, it should be noted that this study was performed retrospectively. In the authorsâ€™ experience, most women with CADASIL have an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery, but transient neurologic events are sometimes reported (mostly consistent with migraine aura) [Lesnik Oberstein, unpublished observation based on clinical practice].
