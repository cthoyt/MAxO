Pregnancy Management

Although no systemic studies have been done concerning pregnancy in women with DI-CMTB, there are reports of an increased occurrence of abnormal fetal presentation and maternal postpartum bleeding in women with CMT in general [Hoff et al 2005]. The early miscarriage rate is not increased in women with CMT [Argov & de Visser 2009].
