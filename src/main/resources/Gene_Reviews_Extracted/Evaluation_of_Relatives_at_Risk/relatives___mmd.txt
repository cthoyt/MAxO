Pregnancy Management

In women with MmD, there is risk for malignant hyperthermia during delivery if inhalational anesthetic agents are used. A woman who has a fetus affected by MmD may develop polyhydramnios during pregnancy and may report a history of poor fetal movements. Abnormal presentation of an affected fetus may complicate delivery.
