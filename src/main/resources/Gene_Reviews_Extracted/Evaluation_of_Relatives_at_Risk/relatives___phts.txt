When a PTEN pathogenic variant has been identified in a proband, testing of asymptomatic at-risk relatives can identify those who have the family-specific pathogenic variant and, therefore, have PHTS. These individuals are in need of initial evaluation and ongoing surveillance.

Molecular testing is appropriate for at-risk individuals younger than age 18 years, given the possible early disease presentation in individuals with BRRS and Proteus syndrome. In individuals with PHTS, the earliest documented breast cancer and thyroid cancer are at age 17 years and before age nine years, respectively.

Relatives who have not inherited the PTEN pathogenic variant found in an affected relative do not have PHTS or its associated cancer risks.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
