Molecular genetic testing (if the family-specific variants are known) and/or evaluation by a metabolic physician during the first year of life (if the family-specific variants are not known) allows for early diagnosis and treatment for sibs at increased risk for liver PhK deficiency.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Ideally, women with PhK deficiency consult with their health care team and maintain optimal metabolic control before conception.

It is extremely important that euglycemia is maintained throughout pregnancy to avoid upregulation of counterregulatory hormones which would result in lipolysis and ketosis, with risk of fetal demise. The appropriate diet during pregnancy is unique to each individual. For some, this may only require following a regular healthy diet, but for many it may mean increasing snacks to include more complex carbohydrates and protein and/or adding or increasing the amount of corn starch. Blood glucose concentrations and ketones should also be measured during pregnancy on a regular basis to ensure euglycemia. Adequate amounts of protein are necessary to provide an alternate source of glucose via gluconeogenesis.
