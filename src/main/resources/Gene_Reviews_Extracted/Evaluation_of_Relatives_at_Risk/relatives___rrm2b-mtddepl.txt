If the pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in an affected family member, it is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives so that those who harbor the pathogenic variant(s) can (1) undergo timely routine surveillance for disease complications and (2) avoid possible precipitating factors.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
