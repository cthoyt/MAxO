It is appropriate to evaluate at-risk family members as newborns or infants in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early intervention (sun protection) and future monitoring for signs of liver dysfunction.

Evaluations can include the following:

Molecular genetic testing if both FECH pathogenic variants in the family are known

Biochemical testing to detect markedly increased free erythrocyte protoporphyrin if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy is not complicated by EPP. There may be some improvement in photosensitivity during pregnancy as well as a reduction in protoporphyrin levels [Poh-Fitzpatrick 1997, Heerfordt & Wulf 2016].
