Pregnancy Management

Information is insufficient to determine if particular issues in HMERF relate to pregnancy. In general, onset of symptoms occurs after the age of childbearing. However, a pregnant woman with early manifestations of HMERF or at risk for HMERF should be considered high-risk because of the associated respiratory muscle weakness, and the increased physiologic demands of pregnancy. Consultation with a high-risk maternal-fetal medicine specialist is recommended when possible.

From the point of view of the fetus the authors are unaware of any specific issues relating to HMERF, since this is an adult-onset disorder.
