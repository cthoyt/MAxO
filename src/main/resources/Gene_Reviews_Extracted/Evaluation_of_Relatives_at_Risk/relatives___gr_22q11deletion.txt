Pregnancy Management

Pregnant women must be monitored medically, taking into account any preexisting conditions including congenital heart disease, scoliosis, and asthma. Additional surveillance should include calcium, thyroid, and platelet levels. In addition, changes in mental status/behavior should be referred for immediate evaluation by a mental health care provider.

A fetus at high risk of having the condition should undergo a level II ultrasound with fetal echocardiogram to evaluate for the following anomalies : congenital heart disease; airway, palate, swallowing, and gastrointestinal differences possibly leading to polyhydramnios (congenital diaphragmatic hernia, tracheoesophageal fistula, subglottic stenosis, vascular ring, laryngeal web, and cleft palate/cleft lip/palate); renal anomalies; skeletal differences such as club foot and craniosynostosis; and umbilical and inguinal hernia.
