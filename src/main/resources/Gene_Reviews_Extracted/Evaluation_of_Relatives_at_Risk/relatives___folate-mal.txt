It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

Evaluations can include the following:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known. Molecular genetic testing of younger at-risk sibs who have not undergone prenatal testing should be performed immediately after birth. Those with biallelic SLC46A1 pathogenic variants should be treated with 5-formyltetrahydrofolate immediately.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known and genetic testing is not possible, assessment of blood and CSF folate levels and, if warranted, intestinal absorption of folate in at-risk sibs immediately after birth, or as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed in the proband

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

There is no systematic information on the outcome of pregnancy in women with HFM.

Although the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) is highly expressed in the placenta [Qiu et al 2006], a woman with homozygous pathogenic variants in SLC46A1 that resulted in no PCFT protein production had two normal pregnancies and delivered two healthy infants. The affected womanâ€™s parenteral 5-formylTHF dose was increased when pregnancy was planned [Poncz et al 1981; Poncz & Cohen 1996; Min et al 2008; Goldman, personal communication to Author].

Women with HFM who wish to become pregnant should increase their dose of 5-formylTHF intake above the maintenance dose well in advance of attempting to conceive. Prenatal vitamins are available containing 5-methylTHF rather than folic acid.

Of note, infants with HFM do not appear to be at an increased risk for malformations (e.g., neural tube defects) typically associated with maternal folate deficiency during pregnancy.
