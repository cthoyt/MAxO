If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, prenatal testing can clarify the genetic status of at-risk pregnancies so that glucocorticoid therapy can be initiated as soon as possible after birth in those newborns known to have POMC deficiency.

If POMC deficiency has been previously diagnosed in a family member, and if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known or if prenatal testing has not been performed, it is necessary to evaluate any at-risk newborn (e.g., sibs of a proband) for evidence of adrenal insufficiency and to initiate glucocorticoid therapy as soon as possible if adrenal insufficiency is found.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
