It is appropriate to evaluate the sibs of a proband with DIS in infancy or early childhood in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early support and management of hearing loss. Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing for the causative contiguous gene deletion;

Otologic examination and audiologic assessment.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
