Pregnancy Management

Manifestations of MFDM in an affected fetus may include intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), polyhydramnios, increased nuchal translucency, and/or fetal structural anomalies (e.g., cardiac and renal defects). Management of an affected fetus should include a detailed (‘level II’) fetal ultrasound assessment, and consultation(s) with high-risk obstetrics and/or neonatology, as appropriate for the clinical situation.

The delivery room team should be aware of the possible need for intubation in the event of airway compromise.

Polyhydramnios, if present, should prompt urgent postnatal evaluation for esophageal atresia.
