It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic relatives at risk for BOR/BOS to determine if a treatable and/or possibly progressive otologic and/or renal abnormality is present.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant in the family is known;

Comprehensive physical examination (to include hearing evaluation and renal imaging and function studies) if the pathogenic variant in the family is not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
