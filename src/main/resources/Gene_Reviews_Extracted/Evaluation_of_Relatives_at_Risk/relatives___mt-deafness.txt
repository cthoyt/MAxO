In a family in which the mtDNA pathogenic variant is known, prospective molecular genetic testing of at-risk maternal relatives allows early detection of those who have inherited the mtDNA pathogenic variant and would benefit from avoiding aminoglycosides to prevent onset of hearing loss.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Use of aminoglycoside antibiotics during pregnancy in a mother who has the MT-RNR1 m.1555A>G pathogenic variant should be considered only in the absence of other treatment options, as these antibiotics exhibit incomplete placental transfer.

Of note, if the mother has the MT-RNR1 m.1555A>G pathogenic variant, she will pass it on to the fetus; hence, use of aminoglycosides should be avoided in the newborn.
