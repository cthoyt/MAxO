It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment (in the treatable forms of N-linked CDG) and those who require developmental monitoring and medical management.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known;

Serum transferrin analysis if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are not known and transferrin was abnormal in the proband.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
