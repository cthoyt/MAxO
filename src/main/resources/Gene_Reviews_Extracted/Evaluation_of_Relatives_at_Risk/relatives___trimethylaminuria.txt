It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early treatment of manifestations. Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the FMO3 pathogenic variants in the family are known;

If the familial FMO3 pathogenic variants are not known, molecular genetic testing may detect pathogenic variants.

Biochemical testing if the FMO3 pathogenic variants in the family are not known and/or molecular genetic testing fails to reveal a well-known pathogenic variant.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
