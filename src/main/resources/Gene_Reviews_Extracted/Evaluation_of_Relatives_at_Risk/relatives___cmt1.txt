Pregnancy Management

Rudnik-Sch√∂neborn et al [1993] evaluated 45 pregnancies in 21 women with CMT1. Worsening of the CMT1 symptoms during or after gestation was reported in about half of pregnancies. A follow-up study of 63 pregnancies in 33 women with CMT showed no serious complications but 20% of women reported a worsening of symptoms during pregnancy [Awater et al 2012]. In a study of affected pregnant women in Norway, deliveries involved a higher occurrence of presentation anomalies, use of forceps, and operative delivery; the women also experienced increased post-partum bleeding [Hoff et al 2005].
