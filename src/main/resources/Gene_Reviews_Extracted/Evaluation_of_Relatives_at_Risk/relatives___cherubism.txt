At-risk relatives could be offered clinical and radiographic evaluations given that manifestations may not be evident in all affected individuals. When the disease-causing mutation is known in the proband, molecular genetic testing can be used to evaluate relatives at risk for the disorder. This may allow mildly affected relatives to benefit from early surveillance and intervention.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
