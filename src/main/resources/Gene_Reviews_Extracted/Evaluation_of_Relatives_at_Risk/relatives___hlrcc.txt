It is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing of asymptomatic at-risk relatives improves diagnostic certainty, allows early surveillance and treatment in those with the family-specific pathogenic variant, and reduces costly screening procedures in those who have not inherited the pathogenic variant.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, fumarate hydratase enzyme assay can be used to clarify the disease status of at-risk relatives. Early recognition of clinical manifestations may allow timely intervention and improve outcome. Therefore, clinical surveillance of asymptomatic at-risk relatives for early detection is appropriate.
