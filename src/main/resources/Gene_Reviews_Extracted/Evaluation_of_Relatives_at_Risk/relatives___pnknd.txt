Pregnancy Management

Pregnant women who are on anticonvulsants therapy for PNKD are recommended to take folic acid 5 mg/day. Because of the risk of teratogenic effects related to anticonvulsants, women with mild symptoms related to PNKD may consider discontinuing anticonvulsant therapy during pregnancy.
