Pregnancy Management

Virtually all individuals with SCDO have relative truncal shortening, and some have generalized short stature. For affected women pregnancy may give rise to exaggerated intra-abdominal pressure problems, though there is no published research on this issue. As the spine is distorted there are likely to be concerns with offering spinal and/or epidural anesthesia. However, spinal anesthesia has been successfully administered [Dolak & Tartt 2009].
