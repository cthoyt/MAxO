Once the pathogenic variants in a family have been identified, it is recommended that sibs of an affected individual undergo molecular genetic testing or APRT enzyme activity measurements to allow early diagnosis and treatment in order to improve long-term outcome. Further investigations, including assessment of renal function and urinalysis, are warranted in individuals with biallelic pathogenic variants.

Note: Approximately 15% of individuals with APRT deficiency may be asymptomatic [Edvardsson et al 2001, Boll√©e et al 2010]; they are usually identified during family screening.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

The safety of allopurinol in human pregnancy has not been systematically studied.

Animal studies using high doses of allopurinol have revealed evidence of adverse fetal effects in mice but not in rats or rabbits; it is not clear if these effects are a result of direct fetal toxicity or maternal toxicity. Thus, allopurinol should only be prescribed during pregnancy when the benefit of treatment is believed to outweigh the risk. Treatment with allopurinol during pregnancy should be considered in women with APRT deficiency who have CKD with reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or who have undergone kidney transplantation.

Some post-transplantation immunosuppressive therapies can also have adverse effects on the developing fetus.

A thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of maternal medication use during pregnancy should ideally take place with an appropriate health care provider prior to conception.
