Consideration of molecular genetic testing of at-risk family members (see Genetic Counseling) during childhood is appropriate for surveillance:

Early identification of relatives who have inherited the family-specific NF2 pathogenic variant allows for appropriate screening using MRI for neuroimaging and brain stem auditory evoked response (BAER) testing for audiologic evaluation, thus resulting in earlier detection of disease manifestations and improved final outcomes [Evans et al 2005a].

Early identification of those who have not inherited the family-specific NF2 pathogenic variant eliminates the need for costly screening with MRI and BAER testing.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Although no convincing evidence exists that schwannomas increase in size during pregnancy, hormonal effects on meningiomas are possible; therefore, assessment of the potential risk of increased intracranial pressure is important for women considering pregnancy.
