It is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from institution of treatment and preventive measures.

If the pathogenic and/or susceptibility variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

If the pathogenic and/or susceptibility variants in the family are not known, biochemical genetic testing, such as plasma acylcarnitines and urinary organic acids, can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
