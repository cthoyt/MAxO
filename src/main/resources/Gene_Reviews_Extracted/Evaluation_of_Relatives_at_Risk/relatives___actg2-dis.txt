Using molecular genetic testing for the ACTG2 pathogenic variant identified in an affected family member, it is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk as early diagnosis may help prevent unnecessary surgery for symptoms of intestinal obstruction and may allow early evaluation of bladder and renal function, and the urinary tract for evidence of dilation.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

When a fetus at risk for an ACTG2-related disorder has evidence of bladder distention on prenatal ultrasound examination, consultation with a maternal fetal medicine specialist is recommended. Of note, in some fetuses with prenatal detection of megacystis, vesicoamniotic shunts have been performed. The rationale for this has been questioned [Tuzovic et al 2014].

Among the limited number of mothers with an ACTG2-related disorder reported, some instances of poor labor progression and weak uterine contractions have been noted [Klar et al 2015].
