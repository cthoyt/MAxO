Molecular genetic testing of at-risk sibs for the family-specific pathogenic variants is appropriate to identify those who are affected before symptoms occur for the purpose of early medical management and consideration of presymptomatic bone marrow transplantation.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

To date, pregnancy in a woman with primary FHL has not been described. Secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a rare complication of pregnancy and is beyond the scope of this review. Primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in the fetus is a (reportedly) rare but recognized entity which is typically characterized by nonimmune fetal hydrops [Malloy et al 2004, Nitta et al 2007, Woods et al 2009], preterm delivery [Woods et al 2009], and/or fetal demise. In utero chemotherapy followed by post-natal HCT has been described [Shah et al 2009].
