When both CA5A pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, it is appropriate to evaluate all sibs in order to identify those who would benefit from prompt treatment when symptoms appear.

Of note, in some families, asymptomatic (older) sibs were found to have biallelic CA5A pathogenic variants through family screening [van Karnebeek et al 2014b]. This finding suggests a possible “susceptibility period” during childhood after which individuals with biallelic CA5A pathogenic variants may no longer be at risk of developing signs of CA-VA deficiency.
