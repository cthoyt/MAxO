Because individuals with myotonia congenita may be at increased risk for adverse anesthesia-related events, testing of at-risk individuals during childhood to clarify their genetic status is appropriate.

If the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

If the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are not known, electromyography can be used to clarify the disease status of at-risk relatives.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
