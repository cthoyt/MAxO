If the pathogenic variants are known in a family, it is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of at-risk infants to allow early diagnosis and appropriate management and surveillance, particularly for respiratory complications, renal and liver disease, and visual impairment.

If the pathogenic variants are not known in a family, the following is recommended for at-risk children:

In the newborn period: physical examination by a pediatrician, and consultation with a clinical geneticist as determined by the clinical findings

Age 0-3 months: kidney and liver evaluation, including ultrasound examination and measurement of blood pressure, serum creatinine concentration, and liver enzymes

At six-month intervals: repeat the kidney and liver evaluations.

Parents should be alerted to the signs of CED and advised to contact their childâ€™s healthcare provider if suspicious symptoms, such as polydipsia and/or jaundice, appear.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
