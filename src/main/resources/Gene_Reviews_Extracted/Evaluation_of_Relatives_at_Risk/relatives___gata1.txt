It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing for the familial GATA1 pathogenic variant;

A screening complete blood count to evaluate for thrombocytopenia, anemia, or neutropenia.

Note: Platelet, erythrocyte, and neutrophil counts can vary significantly in individuals with GATA1 pathogenic variants; normal results do not rule out the possibility that the relative has a GATA1 pathogenic variant.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
