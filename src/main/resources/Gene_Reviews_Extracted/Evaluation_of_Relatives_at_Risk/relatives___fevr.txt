Relatives at risk benefit from fundus examination and, ideally, fundus fluorescein angiography to identify any characteristic lesions. Prophylaxis in the form of peripheral retinal ablation with laser photocoagulation or cryotherapy depends on the individual's age and the progression of the lesion.

If the pathogenic mutation has been identified in an affected family member, molecular genetic testing of at-risk family members may be useful: relatives who do not have the family-specific mutation do not need regular retinal examinations.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
