It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from surveillance and prompt initiation of treatment.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known. However, a prepubertal child with a known pathogenic variant may progress through puberty in a normal fashion, delayed fashion, or not at all. Therefore, reevaluation of such individuals over time is important, and hormone treatment should be initiated only when IGD with impaired pubertal development is diagnosed.

If the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are not known, clinical review of at-risk relatives of pubertal age to assess clinical onset of signs of puberty and if delayed, to initiate appropriate therapy for pubertal induction.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
