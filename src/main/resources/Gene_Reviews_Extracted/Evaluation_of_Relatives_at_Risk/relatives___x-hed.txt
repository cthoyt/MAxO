It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic, at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early diagnosis and treatment and, importantly, measures to avoid hyperthermia.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known;

Targeted history, physical examination, and dental examination for the features of HED if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are not known. A sweat test can be done in at-risk relatives of an individual with XLHED.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Optimal prenatal nutrition is recommended for mothers who are carriers of or affected with HED. Affected women at risk for hyperthermia should take extra care not to become overheated during pregnancy. There are no other special recommendations for pregnancy management.

Some women may have difficulty breastfeeding their infants because of hypoplasia of the mammary glands.
