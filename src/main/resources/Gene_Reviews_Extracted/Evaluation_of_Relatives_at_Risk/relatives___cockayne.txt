Pregnancy Management

In pregnant women affected with CS, the limited size of the pelvis and abdomen is the major obstacle to the growth of the fetus and the major threat to the outcome of the pregnancy. Prevention of premature labor and caesarean section under spinal anesthesia are usually needed [Lahiri & Davies 2003, Rawlinson & Webster 2003].
