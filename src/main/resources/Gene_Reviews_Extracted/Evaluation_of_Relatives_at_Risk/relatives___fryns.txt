Testing of sibs at risk for Fryns syndrome requires an evaluation for physical anomalies (see Diagnosis and Management, Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis). If chromosome studies were not obtained on the proband, CMA to evaluate for the possibility of a chromosome disorder (see Differential Diagnosis) could be performed in the sib(s) at risk. A high index of suspicion for a chromosome aberration should prompt evaluation for deletions of the chromosomal loci associated with a Fryns syndrome-like phenotype.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancies are managed according to the malformations that have been diagnosed. One literature review concluded that fetoscopic endoluminal tracheal occlusion (FETO) used as a prenatal interventional strategy can increase survival in cases with severe CDH [Cundy et al 2014], although this technique has most frequently been used for isolated CDH rather than Fryns syndrome.
