Relatives at risk for OCA2 can be identified by clinical findings (hypopigmentation and eye features); additional testing is not indicated.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

No form of classic OCA impairs fertility or compromises pregnancy or gestation.

An obligate carrier (heterozygous) fetus of a mother with OCA2 faces no additional risks over an unaffected fetus of an unaffected mother.
