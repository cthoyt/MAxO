If the HMBS pathogenic variant is known in a family, at-risk relatives can benefit from molecular genetic testing to clarify their genetic status, so that those at increased risk of developing acute attacks of AIP can be identified early and counseled about preventive measures.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

The majority of women with AIP have completely normal pregnancies with no clinical problems relating to the porphyria [Marsden & Rees 2010]. However, there is a small chance that pregnancy could initiate or worsen porphyria symptoms.

When a woman with AIP experiences abdominal pain, hypertension, and tachycardia during pregnancy, complications of pregnancy should be excluded before the findings are attributed to an acute attack.

Symptomatic treatment of an acute attack that occurs during pregnancy should take into account drug safety with respect to teratogenicity and precipitating/exacerbating an acute attack of porphyria.

Intravenous human hemin (both available preparations) has been used for the treatment of acute attacks in pregnancy and appears to be safe [Anderson et al 2005, Marsden & Rees 2010]. Several women in the UK and France have received regular heme arginate infusions during pregnancy without any obvious adverse effects on mother or child [Badminton & Deybach 2006].

Prolonged fasting should be avoided during labor and delivery as should the use of unsafe drugs, for example, ergometrine.

Note: In an obstetric emergency, no drug should be restricted if it is likely to be of major clinical benefit or is required in a life-threatening situation.

Stress should be minimized by providing good analgesia. Regional anesthesia, in the form of spinal or epidural anesthesia using bupivacaine, has been safely used.
