In families with known CSCD, at-risk children should be seen by an ophthalmologist within a few months after birth to determine if they have the condition. Alternatively, if the DCN pathogenic variant in the family has been identified, molecular genetic testing of at-risk children can be pursued.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
