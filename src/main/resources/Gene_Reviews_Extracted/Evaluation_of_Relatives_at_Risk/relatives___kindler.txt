Pregnancy Management

Although the cutaneous manifestations of KS are not exacerbated by pregnancy, vaginal stenosis and labial synechiae have been reported; thus, obstetric planning, such as consideration of delivery by elective cesarean section, warrants consideration [Mansur et al 2007]. Of note, specialized perioperative cesarean section management is needed to protect vulnerable skin and mucosa.

Breast-feeding is not advised because of the risk of blistering the breasts [Hayashi et al 2007].
