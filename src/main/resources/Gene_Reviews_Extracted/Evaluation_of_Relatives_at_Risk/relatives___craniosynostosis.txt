At-risk relatives should be evaluated by clinical and radiographic criteria given that manifestations may not be readily evident in all affected individuals. When the pathogenic variant is known in the family, molecular genetic testing can be used to evaluate relatives for the disorder. Early diagnosis may allow mildly affected relatives to benefit from early surveillance and intervention.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
