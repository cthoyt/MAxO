It is appropriate to test male relatives at risk for Menkes disease for the ATP7A pathogenic variant identified in the family before age ten days in order to promptly begin copper replacement treatment (see Prevention of Primary Manifestations).

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
