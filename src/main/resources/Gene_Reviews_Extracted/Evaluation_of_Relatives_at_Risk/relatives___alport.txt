It is appropriate to evaluate family members at risk for Alport syndrome or thin basement membrane nephropathy in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

Urinalysis

Males. A single urinalysis is sufficient in a male.

Females. Several urinalyses should be performed in females before concluding that hematuria is absent.

Molecular genetic testing. If the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk family members. Molecular genetic testing is necessary to exclude heterozygosity in an at-risk female who does not have hematuria.

Relatives found to have proteinuria, hypertension, and/or a pathogenic variant should be referred to a nephrologist for further evaluation. In the absence of proteinuria or hypertension, relatives at risk should, at a minimum, have an annual urinalysis and measurement of blood pressure if molecular genetic testing is not available.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
