Molecular genetic testing of apparently asymptomatic younger sibs of an affected individual for the familial SLC39A14 pathogenic variants allows early identification of sibs who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures (see Agents/Circumstances to Avoid).

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
