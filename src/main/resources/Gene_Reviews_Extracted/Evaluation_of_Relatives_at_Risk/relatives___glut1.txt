It is appropriate to evaluate at-risk newborns, infants, and other relatives at risk in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures. Molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives if the pathogenic variant in the family is known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
