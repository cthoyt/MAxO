It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known. Prenatal testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs before birth.

Blood or urine succinylacetone analysis as soon as possible after birth if prenatal testing was not performed. This allows prompt initiation of treatment, as postnatal genetic testing results may not be available in a timely fashion.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known, consideration of analysis for urine succinylacetone in healthy older sibs

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Little data exist on the use of nitisinone during human pregnancy. Speculation would assume that the pregnant woman remains safe from untoward events; however, the developing fetus may be at risk because of alterations in tyrosine metabolism.

At least two women have given birth to healthy infants while receiving therapeutic doses of nitisinone [Garcia Segarra et al 2010].

In one instance the affected mother gave birth to an unaffected infant who is reported to be healthy and developing normally at age 2.5 years [Garcia Segarra et al 2010, Vanclooster et al 2012].

In another instance, an affected woman gave birth to an affected child. The child is reported to have normal growth and development at age seven months [Garcia Segarra et al 2010]. The authors speculate that the affected child was protected from in utero liver damage by maternal treatment with nitisinone during pregnancy.
