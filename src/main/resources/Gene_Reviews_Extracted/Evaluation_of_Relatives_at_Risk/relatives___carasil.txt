It has been speculated that hypertension or smoking may influence the age of onset and frequency of stroke episodes in individuals with CARASIL; smoking may result in earlier disease onset [Singhal et al 2004] and smoking or hypertension may increase the frequency of stroke episodes in individuals with CADASIL [Samii et al 2010]. Therefore, it is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures such as oral administration of anti-hypertensive drugs and abstinence from smoking.

If the HTRA1 pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known, brain MRI can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

No special management is necessary in pregnancy for individual with CARASIL.
