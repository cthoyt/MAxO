It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic at-risk adult relatives of an affected individual to allow for early diagnosis and treatment of cardiac manifestations, diabetes mellitus, and cataracts.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Women with DM1 are at risk for complications during pregnancy including increased spontaneous abortion rate, premature labor, prolonged labor, retained placenta, placenta previa, and postpartum hemorrhage [Zaki et al 2007, Argov & de Visser 2009]. Special surveillance during pregnancy of women with DM1 includes ultrasound examination; evaluation for placenta previa; and anticipation of possible polyhydramnios, prolonged labor, and/or need for delivery by cesarean section [Argov & de Visser 2009]. Complications related to the presence of congenital DM1 in the fetus include reduced fetal movement and polyhydramnios. Awater et al [2012] found increased rates of caesarean birth and preterm delivery among women with DM1.
