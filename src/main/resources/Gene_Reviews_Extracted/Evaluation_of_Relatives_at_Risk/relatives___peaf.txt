It is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and measures to minimize risk in the event of seizure onset (e.g., avoidance of unattended swimming).

If the LGI1 or RELN pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, interview of relatives at risk may identify symptoms possibly related to seizures.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
