If prenatal testing has not been performed (see Genetic Counseling), each at-risk newborn sib should be treated from birth until results of diagnostic testing are available. Diagnostic evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known;

Measurement of GALE enzyme activity in red blood cells if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known. Note: If there are concerns about the reliability of the prenatal testing, soy-based formula may be given while the diagnostic testing is being performed.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
