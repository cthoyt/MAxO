Wolfram syndrome. Sibs of a proband warrant either molecular genetic testing (if the family-specific pathogenic variants are known) or screening for the earliest manifestations of WFS (i.e., diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss) to allow for early diagnosis and treatment.

Low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss (LFSNHL). At-risk relatives should be encouraged to seek either molecular genetic testing (if the family-specific pathogenic variant is known) or audiologic evaluation because the earliest manifestations of low-tone hearing loss may not be appreciated clinically.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnant women with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus have a two- to eightfold higher risk than pregnant women without diabetes of having a child with a birth defect or a pattern of birth defects (diabetic embryopathy). These defects can involve the craniofacial, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urogenital, musculoskeletal, and central nervous systems. Optimizing glucose control before and during pregnancy can reduce, but does not eliminate, the risk for diabetic embryopathy. High-resolution fetal ultrasonography and fetal echocardiogram are recommended to screen for congenital anomalies during pregnancy. Consultation with a maternal fetal medicine specialist during pregnancy should also be considered.
