It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant in the family is known;

If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, physical examination and imaging studies (skin examination, retinal examination, brain imaging, and renal ultrasound examination) to assess for the clinical features of TSC (see Diagnosis).

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
