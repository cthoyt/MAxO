It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual to allow early diagnosis and appropriate monitoring for bone marrow failure, physical abnormalities, and related cancers.

Evaluations include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant in the family is known;

Consideration of other testing (e.g., mean corpuscular volume, eADA, and/or fetal hemoglobin concentration) if the pathogenic variant in the family is not known – especially of relatives being considered as bone marrow donors [Vlachos et al 2008].

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Management of pregnancy in marrow failure disorders requires obstetricians with expertise in high-risk pregnancies and hematologists with experience with marrow failure syndromes [Alter et al 1999].

During pregnancy the maternal hemoglobin level must be monitored.

Use of low-dose aspirin up to 37 weeks’ gestation may help prevent vasculo-placental complications in women with a history of a previous problematic pregnancy [Faivre et al 2006].

A study that surveyed 64 pregnancies in women with DBA found a high incidence of complications in both mothers and children. Risks include the following [Faivre et al 2006]:

Intrauterine growth retardation

Preeclampsia

Retroplacental hematoma

In utero fetal death

Preterm delivery
