It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of preventive measures. Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known;

Consideration of motor nerve conduction velocities and nerve biopsy if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

CMT appears to be an independent risk factor for complications during pregnancy and delivery.

The symptoms of CMT can worsen during pregnancy; in particular: cramps, subjective sensitivity (e.g., paresthesias), difficulty walking, and fatigue.

In rare cases, crises occurring during pregnancy do not subside post partum.

A retrospective study in Norway between 1967 and 2002 comparing 108 births to mothers with CMT with 2.1 million births to mothers without CMT determined that mothers with CMT more frequently needed interventions during delivery [Hoff et al 2005]. Bleeding post partum was also more common in mothers with CMT.

It has been postulated that fetal presentation tends to be abnormal because of the combination of CMT in the mother and fetus [Rayl et al 1996, Hoff et al 2005].
