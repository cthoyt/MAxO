It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and/or surveillance for cardiovascular and/or neurologic manifestations.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known;

Examination by a clinical geneticist if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
