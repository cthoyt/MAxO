Pregnancy Management

In female heterozygotes, the probability of manifestations of the McLeod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome in the reproductive period is presumably very low; thus, no particular recommendations can be made. Of note, transfusion reactions have to be considered in female carriers who have the McLeod blood group phenotype (see Prevention of Secondary Complications).

No prenatal or perinatal neurologic manifestations of MLS are known; however, severe anemia can be observed in Kell-positive newborns born to sensitized Kell-negative mothers [Lee et al 2000b, Jung et al 2007].
