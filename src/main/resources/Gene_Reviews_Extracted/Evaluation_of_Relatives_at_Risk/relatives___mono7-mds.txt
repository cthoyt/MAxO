Because the goal of management in familial monosomy 7 is early diagnosis for initiation of BMT prior to the emergence of a leukemic clone, it is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk including sibs and potentially maternal first cousins, based on kindreds described in Mode of Inheritance.

In sibs and cousins of individuals with a history of familial monosomy 7, signs and symptoms that cannot be accounted for otherwise should be evaluated by their physicians as potential early indications of the cytopenias and bone marrow dysplasia which appear prior to the development of AML or MDS.

To evaluate sibs at risk, perform cytogenetic studies/chromosomal microarray (CMA) on bone marrow or unstimulated peripheral blood (FISH and/or conventional cytogenetics), hematologic studies, and hemoglobin F assessment. If these are normal, repeat of hematologic studies on a yearly basis is reasonable, followed by chromosomal studies if abnormalities are detected.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
