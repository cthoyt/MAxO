It is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from medical surveillance and preventive measures.

If the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

If the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are not known, a targeted clinical examination, with or without neurophysiologic testing, can clarify whether a muscle biopsy should be considered.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
