When the SLC52A2 or SLC52A3 pathogenic variants in the family are known, it is appropriate to perform molecular genetic testing on the older and younger sibs of a proband with riboflavin transporter deficiency neuronopathy to identify as early as possible those with biallelic pathogenic variants who would benefit from early treatment with riboflavin supplementation and monitoring for potential complications of the disorder.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Females who have riboflavin transporter deficiency neuronopathy with biallelic pathogenic variants in either SLC52A2 or SLC52A3 should take riboflavin supplements before and during pregnancy and when breast feeding to avoid inducing riboflavin deficiency in the fetus and infant. Recommended doses during pregnancy are 10 mg/kg/day.

Few studies have evaluated for adverse fetal outcome after excessive maternal riboflavin intake during pregnancy. Riboflavin deficiency during pregnancy, however, has been associated with an increased risk of maternal preeclampsia and preterm delivery [Wacker et al 2000, Carmichael et al 2013].

Note: Although no data are available, the authors recommend a diet rich in riboflavin during pregnancy for females who are heterozygous for a pathogenic variant in either SLC52A2 or SLC52A3 as it is unknown if they are at increased risk of developing symptoms due to an increased demand for riboflavin during pregnancy.
