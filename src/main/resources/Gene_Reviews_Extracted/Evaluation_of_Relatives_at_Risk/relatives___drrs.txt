Although reduced penetrance does not appear to be associated with most SALL4 pathogenic variants, unaffected persons may consider molecular genetic testing prior to family planning. Children of affected persons who are themselves not obviously affected may be tested for the pathogenic variant present in the family because individuals with the pathogenic variant should undergo clinical evaluation for hearing problems, renal disease, eye disease, and heart defects.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
