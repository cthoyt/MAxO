While no data on outcomes are available, it is appropriate to use molecular genetic testing for the SPR pathogenic variants identified in the proband and/or analysis of CSF neurotransmitter metabolites and pterins to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of an affected individual in order to identify as soon as possible those who would benefit from early initiation of treatment to correct CNS dopamine and serotonin deficiency.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

No pregnancies have been reported to date in women with SRD.

Based on reports that suggest that L-dopa may be advantageous during pregnancy in women with GTP cyclohydrolase 1-deficient dopa-responsive dystonia (DYT-GCH1), it would seem prudent for women with SRD to continue L-dopa therapy during pregnancy [Trender-Gerhard et al 2009, Watanabe & Matsubara 2012].
