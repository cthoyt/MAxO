It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic at-risk relatives in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

Evaluations can include the following:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known

Routine DHR testing of peripheral blood, which will detect the CGD disease state (except for p40phox deficiency) if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are not known

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

The major concern during the pregnancy of a woman known to have CGD is continued use of prophylactic antimicrobials.

Trimethoprim, a folic acid antagonist, is usually avoided in pregnancy

Sulfamethoxazole is not known to increase the risk of birth defects in humans; however, it is typically administered in conjunction with trimethoprim for prophylaxis in affected non-pregnant women.

Data regarding teratogenicity of itraconazole are limited. Although case reports of birth defects in infants born to women taking itraconazole during pregnancy have been published, this observation is not supported by larger case series. Given the lack of adequate data on the use of itraconazole during pregnancy, some practitioners suggest that it should be avoided during pregnancy until such data become available.

The authorsâ€™ practice for women with CGD who are or are planning to become pregnant is to use antibacterial prophylaxis (e.g., penicillin- or cephalosporin-based therapies) for which more data on safety during pregnancy exist [Author, personal communication]. Although no antifungal prophylactic medications known to be completely safe during pregnancy are currently available, the risks and benefits of antifungal treatment must be weighed case by case. Interferon gamma is held during pregnancy and restarted after breastfeeding has ceased.
