Evaluation of at-risk relatives can help identify those with mild or moderately severe disease who may benefit from treatment. If the family-specific ELANE pathogenic variant is known, molecular genetic testing can be used; otherwise serial ANCs can be evaluated.

Note: Complete blood counts (CBCs) obtained weekly for a month until an ANC lower than 0.2 x 109/L is documented in more than one sample confirms the diagnosis. A similar series of counts not showing neutropenia rules out this diagnosis.

Treatment of these individuals with G-CSF or any other modality should be based on medical history and the severity of symptoms. It is not yet clear if there are specific risks (i.e., osteoporosis, myelodysplasia, or leukemia) associated with administering G-CSF to such individuals, but conservative management is recommended.

Pregnancy Management 

Pregnancies in women with severe chronic neutropenia are at substantial risk for miscarriage.

A review of the records of 88 women (183 pregnancies) with congenital, cyclic, idiopathic or autoimmune neutropenia compared outcomes in those on G-CSF therapy during pregnancy with those not on G-CSF therapy during pregnancy [Boxer et al 2010]. In general the health of all the infants was equivalent for the two groups. Other findings included:

Reduced risk of fetal loss in the women treated during pregnancy.

Eleven complications (one premature rupture of membranes, two life-threatening infections, two minor infections, and six premature labors) in 55 women (123 pregnancies) not treated with G-CSF during pregnancy.

No life-threatening infections, no premature labors, five minor infections, and one patient who developed severe thrombocytopenia in 41 women (60 pregnancies) treated with G-CSF during pregnancy.
