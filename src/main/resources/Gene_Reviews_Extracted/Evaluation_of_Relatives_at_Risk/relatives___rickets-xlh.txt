Testing of at-risk infants and children is warranted to ensure early diagnosis and early treatment for optimal outcome.

Evaluation can be accomplished by:

Molecular genetic testing if the PHEX pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member;

Biochemical testing consisting of serum phosphorus, creatinine, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, intact parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D], and 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D concentrations and urine phosphorus and creatinine concentrations. Infants with initially normal test results require reevaluation every two to three months until at least age one year.

No role has been established for screening asymptomatic adult family members.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

No data on the use of phosphate and calcitriol in pregnant women with XLH are available. Most women with XLH who are on active therapy at the time of conception are continued on treatment throughout the pregnancy with vigilant monitoring of urinary calcium-to-creatinine ratios to detect hypercalciuria early in order to modify treatment accordingly. Those individuals who are not on therapy at the time of conception are generally not started on treatment during pregnancy.
