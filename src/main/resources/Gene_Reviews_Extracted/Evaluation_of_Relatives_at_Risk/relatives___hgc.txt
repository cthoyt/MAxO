It is appropriate to offer molecular genetic testing to at-risk relatives if the CDH1 pathogenic variant is identified in an affected family member, so that morbidity and mortality can be reduced by early diagnosis and treatment. See Genetic Counseling, Testing of asymptomatic at-risk individuals younger than age 18 years for discussion of issues related to testing of this population.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Testing of Populations at Risk

In Japan, where the prevalence of gastric cancer is high, a mass population screening program allows for successful detection of early disease by endoscopy [Shiratori et al 1985]. In this program, all suspicious findings seen on endoscopy are biopsied and evaluated histologically. Suspicious findings include minute changes in the color of the mucosa, altered vascular pattern, roughened surface, flat lesions, and minor mucosal irregularities.

Pregnancy Management

Evidence shows that pregnancy after PTG can have healthy and normal outcomes. Kaurah et al [2010] discussed six healthy pregnancies and infants born to four women after total gastrectomy. However, it is important that women who have undergone PTG and are pregnant be followed closely by their physician and a dietician who is aware of the situation.
