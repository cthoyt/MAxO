It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those with PFCP who would benefit from education regarding agents and circumstances to avoid and inappropriate treatments. Evaluations can include the following:

If the EPOR pathogenic variant in the family is known. Molecular genetic testing

If no pathogenic variant has been identified in the family. Blood count and serum EPO concentration if hemoglobin and hematocrit are increased

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

No information is available on the management of pregnancy in a woman with PFCP.

Although the only survey of pregnancy in women with congenital erythrocytosis did not include any women with an EPOR pathogenic variant, data showed that when treated with low-dose aspirin and phlebotomy to reduce the hematocrit to a suitable level, women with erythrocytosis can have normal pregnancies and give birth to healthy children [McMullin et al 2015].
