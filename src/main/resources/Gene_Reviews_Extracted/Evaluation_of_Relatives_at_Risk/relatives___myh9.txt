It is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

Assessing platelet count and size in a newborn at risk for MYH9RD identifies those at risk for bleeding.

If the family-specific pathogenic variant is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to evaluate at-risk family members so that early diagnosis can inform treatment.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Deliveries should be managed as they are in women with other forms of thrombocytopenia (MYH9RD is not usually associated with defects of platelet function). As expected, pregnant women whose thrombocytopenia and bleeding history before pregnancy are more severe have a higher incidence of delivery-related bleeding. In general, a platelet count of â‰¥50 x 109/L is recommended for safe delivery. Vaginal deliveries in women with severe thrombocytopenia should be considered at increased risk for neonatal intracranial bleeding [Noris et al 2014b].
