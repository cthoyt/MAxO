Pregnancy Management

Affected pregnant women may be at increased risk for spontaneous abortions, premature rupture of membranes, and rupture of arteries [Esaka et al 2009]. Two affected women had a total of seven pregnancies resulting in three miscarriages and four healthy children, three of whom were born vaginally at term and one of whom was born at 24 weeks; there were no maternal complications [Steinmann, unpublished]. Delivery should be performed in a medical center.
