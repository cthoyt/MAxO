Pregnancy Management

Outcome of 105 pregnancies in 38 women with FSHD was generally favorable [Ciafaloni et al 2006]. However, rates for low birth-weight infants, augmented extraction procedures such as forceps and vacuum assisted deliveries, delivery by Cesarean section, and anesthetic complications were higher than for the general population. Worsening of weakness occurred in 24% of the pregnancies, beginning during the pregnancy and generally not resolving after delivery.
