Once the familial pathogenic variant(s) have been identified, at-risk relatives can be readily analyzed for the pathogenic variant(s) to allow early diagnosis and treatment as needed [Keeney et al 2008].

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

VWF levels increase throughout pregnancy with the peak occurring in the third trimester. Nonetheless, pregnant women with VWD are at increased risk for bleeding complications and care should be provided in centers with experience in perinatal management of bleeding disorders [James & Jamison 2007, Varughese & Cohen 2007, James et al 2009].

Women with baseline VWF and FVIII levels of >30 IU/dL are likely to achieve normal levels by the time of delivery, whereas those with a basal level <20 IU/dL and those with baseline VWF:RCo/VWF:Ag ratio <0.6 are likely to require replacement therapy [Castaman et al 2013].

Although deliveries should occur based on obstetric indications, instrumentation should be minimized [Demers et al 2005].

Delayed, secondary postpartum bleeding may be a problem. VWF level rapidly returns to pre-pregnancy level following delivery [Castaman et al 2013].
