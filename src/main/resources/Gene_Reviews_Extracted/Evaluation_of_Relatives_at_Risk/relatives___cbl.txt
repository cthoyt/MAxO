If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, at-risk sibs may be tested prenatally to allow initiation of treatment as soon as possible after birth.

If the newborn sibling of an affected individual has not undergone prenatal testing, the infant can be tested in the first week of life by urine organic acids, plasma amino acids, measurement of total plasma homocysteine, and acylcarnitine profile analysis for the purpose of early diagnosis and treatment. If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to confirm the diagnosis.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

A good pregnancy outcome was reported in a woman with cblC treated with OHCbl 1.0 mg IM, folic acid 5.0 mg per day, aspirin 80 mg per day, levocarnitine, and low-protein diet [Brunel-Guitton et al 2010].

Prenatal therapy of an affected fetus by administration of intramuscular OHCbl to the mother may decrease developmental abnormalities and improve neurocognitive outcome [Huemer et al 2005, Trefz et al 2012] but does not appear to affect the ophthalmologic outcome [Patton et al 2000]. The dose and frequency of administration of IM OHCbl has not been established. Favorable outcomes of prenatal treatment have been reported by using dosages between 1 to 10 mg per day, 2-3 times a week, starting as early as 15 weeksâ€™ gestational age [Huemer et al 2005, Trefz et al 2012].
