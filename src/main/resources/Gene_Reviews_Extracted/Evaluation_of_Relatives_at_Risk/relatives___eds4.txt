It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who could benefit from surveillance, awareness of treatment for potential complications, and appropriate restriction of high-impact sports. Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant in the family is known;

Clinical evaluation and physical examination if the pathogenic variant in the family is not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

It is prudent to follow pregnant women with vEDS in a high-risk obstetrical program.

It is not known if elective caesarian section or pre-term delivery decreases the risk of mortality.

Educating the pregnant woman as to possible complications and the need for close monitoring is recommended.

Experience with use of assisted reproductive technologies for women with vEDS is limited [Bergeron et al 2014].
