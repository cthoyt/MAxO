It is appropriate to employ genetic testing to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband previously found to have the 17q12 recurrent duplication in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from close assessment/monitoring of developmental milestones in childhood or psychological issues through adulthood.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
