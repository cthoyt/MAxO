Pregnancy Management

There is limited published literature addressing the management of the pregnancy of an affected woman or the effect of maternal EA2 on a fetus. However, because physical exertion can trigger attacks, it would be prudent for a pregnant woman to be followed closely by her obstetrician and at term to undergo a trial of labor with the intent to proceed to delivery by C-section should the labor trigger an EA2 attack [Spacey 2012].
