It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic children who are relatives of an affected individual by genomic testing for the int22h1/int22h2-mediated Xq28 duplication. Clinically asymptomatic children who have the familial duplication should be assessed and monitored for developmental delay with the goal of early initiation of therapies and support if needed.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
