Pregnancy Management

There is a paucity of literature regarding pregnancy management in women with skeletal dysplasias. However, a number of women with hypochondroplasia have had unremarkable pregnancies and deliveries.

In comparison to women who have achondroplasia, vaginal deliveries are possible, although for each pregnancy, pelvic outlet capacity should be assessed in relation to fetal head size.

Epidural or spinal anesthetic can be utilized, but a consultation with an anesthesiologist prior to delivery is recommended to assess the spinal anatomy.

If present, spinal stenosis may be aggravated during pregnancy due to the normal physiologic changes to the shape of the spine that occur as gestation progresses.
