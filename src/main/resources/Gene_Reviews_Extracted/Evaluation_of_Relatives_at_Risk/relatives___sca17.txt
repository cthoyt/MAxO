Pregnancy Management

Affected women may be on medications (e.g., antiepileptics) to control the symptoms of SCA17. Because some medications can have adverse effects on the developing fetus, a thorough discussion of the medical benefits vs. risks to the fetus of such medications before pregnancy (or, in the case of an unplanned pregnancy, immediately after pregnancy is determined) is appropriate.
