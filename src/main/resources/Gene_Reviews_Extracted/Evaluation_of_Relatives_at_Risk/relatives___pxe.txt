Pregnancy Management

In the series of Bercovitch et al [2004], there was no statistically significant effect of gravidity on the severity of skin, eye, cardiac, or peripheral vascular manifestations of PXE in women over 40. In addition, women over 40 with PXE who had been pregnant did not have more severe skin, cardiac, ocular, or vascular manifestations of PXE than those who had never been pregnant. Except for the consequences of severe maternal gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which appears to be uncommon, PXE has no known significant effect on the fetus. Retinal examination during pregnancy and prompt attention to any visual symptoms are advised.
