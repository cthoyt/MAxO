It is appropriate to offer molecular genetic testing for the NBN pathogenic variants identified in the proband to apparently asymptomatic sibs of a proband and young adult relatives at risk of being carriers (heterozygotes) in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from monitoring for malignancy (see Surveillance) and to inform treatment options if a malignancy is diagnosed (see Agents/Circumstances to Avoid).

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
