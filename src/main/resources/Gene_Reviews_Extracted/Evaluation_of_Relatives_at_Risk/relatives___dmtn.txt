Recommendations vary by underlying genetic mechanism:

When the proband is identified as having TNDM caused by an inherited paternal 6q24 duplication, the sibs and offspring of the proband are at increased risk of inheriting the duplication. Screening for diabetes mellitus is appropriate for those infants who have inherited the paternal 6q24 duplication.

For 6q24-TNDM caused by ZFP57 pathogenic variants, sibs are at a 25% risk for the same condition, although the clinical findings can be variable.

Although individuals reported to have 6q24-TNDM as the result of an imprinting center epimutation have been simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family), it is not clear if all cases are de novo (see also Genetic Counseling).

Screening the mother and sibs of these individuals for diabetes mellitus may be appropriate.

Offspring of female probands with 6q24-TNDM caused by a hypomethylation of the maternal PLAGL1/HYMAI differentially methylated region (DMR) may be at risk of having 6q24-TNDM or of developing diabetes mellitus later in life and should be offered testing.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

There are no specific guidelines on pregnancy management for women with a history of 6q24-TNDM. However, it is important to inform health professionals during the pregnancy of a susceptibility to diabetes. Rarely some affected women with classic 6q24-TNDM genetic aberrations (e.g., duplication of 6q24, paternal UPD 6, methylation mutations) will develop gestational diabetes; therefore, pregnancy is thought to be a risk factor for recurrence of diabetes.

If prenatal diagnosis identifies an affected fetus, fetal growth is anticipated to lag during the third trimester.
