Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy of a fetus with PCH2 carries no special risk to the mother. No treatment for the condition is available. In the last trimester cerebellar development lags, which can be followed by measuring transverse cerebellar diameter. Birth is usually normal and uncomplicated; problems usually arise shortly after birth with irritability and impaired swallowing, often necessitating gavage feeding.

Pregnancy of a fetus with PCH4 may lead to polyhydramnios due to impaired fetal swallowing. Fetal akinesia often causes congenital contractures. Intrauterine clonus may be perceived by the mother through the uterine wall. Clonus persists after birth and is usually severe. Absence of respiratory movement necessitates mechanical support at birth.
