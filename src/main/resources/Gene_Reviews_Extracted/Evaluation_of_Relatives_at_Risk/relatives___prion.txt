No cases of pregnant women affected with prion disease have been documented; if such a situation were to arise, clinical judgment regarding the safety and viability of the fetus and the life expectancy of the mother (which can be estimated based on the pathogenic variant and time of onset of symptoms) should be used in determining the best course of action during the pregnancy.
