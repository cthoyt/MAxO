Molecular genetic testing of at-risk males in a family with a known pathogenic variant either prenatally or immediately after birth enables early diagnosis and BMT in affected males before significant organ damage occurs.

If the pathogenic variant is not known, monitoring at-risk males for early-onset diarrhea, diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, and autoimmune hematologic manifestations can allow early identification of affected males.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
