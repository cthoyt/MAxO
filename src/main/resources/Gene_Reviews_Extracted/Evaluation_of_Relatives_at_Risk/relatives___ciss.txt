Pregnancy Management

Females with CISS may conceive normally. No complications during pregnancy have been reported to date.

Treatments for cold-induced sweating (clonidine, amitriptyline, moxonidine) should be discontinued during pregnancy, as the potential for teratogenic effects on the fetus is not well studied and remains possible. The prescription of clonidine should not be discontinued abruptly; the drug should be phased out over four to six days.
