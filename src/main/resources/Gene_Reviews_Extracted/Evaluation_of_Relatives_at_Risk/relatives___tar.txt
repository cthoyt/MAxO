Pregnancy Management

Fewer than ten pregnancies have been reported in women with TAR syndrome. Almost all develop thrombocytopenia during pregnancy. In one, corticosteroids appeared to be fairly successful in treating the thrombocytopenia [Bot-Robin et al 2011]. In one pregnant woman with TAR syndrome, exacerbation of her thrombocytopenia preceded the development of preeclampsia.

Other considerations during pregnancy include potential difficulties with administration of regional anesthetics (given potential difficulties with vascular access) and difficulties accessing the airway for general anesthesia [Wax et al 2009].
