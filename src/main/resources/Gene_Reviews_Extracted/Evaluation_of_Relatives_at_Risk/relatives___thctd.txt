Pregnancy Management

In a recent report, two unaffected heterozygous pregnant women with unaffected fetuses were treated with L-T4 in the second half of pregnancy [Ramos et al 2011]. It is unclear if this had any effect, either beneficial or detrimental, on the fetus. Of note, many unaffected heterozygous mothers have given birth to normal unaffected children without any prenatal treatment.
