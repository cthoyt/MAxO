Molecular genetic testing is appropriate in the sibs of affected individuals to identify those with the pathogenic variants known to be present in the family so that appropriate evaluation and treatment can be initiated before hypoglycemia occurs. Because of the severe neurologic consequences of delayed diagnosis and treatment, it is imperative that at-risk individuals be tested and a definitive diagnosis be made as rapidly as possible. Once the causative pathogenic variants have been identified in a proband, it is prudent to test all at-risk relatives. Depending on the findings, more extensive family investigations may be warranted. For further discussion of prenatal diagnosis, see Prenatal Testing.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Affected individuals who previously underwent near-total or sub-total pancreatectomy typically have insulin-requiring diabetes by the time they become pregnant. In this case, treatment is the same as for individuals with preexisting diabetes from any cause. There is little, if any, experience with pregnancy in individuals who were treated conservatively or who underwent limited pancreatectomy for focal FHI, as these treatments are relatively new. In this situation, close monitoring of glucose to detect both recurrent hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia is warranted. If hyperglycemia is documented, treatment should be instituted as for any woman with gestational diabetes. A fetus at risk for FHI should be monitored for size and weight. Excessive fetal weight gain during the last trimester of pregnancy increases the risk of obstetric complications and of cesarean delivery. In pregnant women with a history of FHI and gestational hyperglycemia due to prior surgical treatment, the fetus should be monitored as for any case of preexisting type 1, preexisting type 2, or gestational diabetes.
