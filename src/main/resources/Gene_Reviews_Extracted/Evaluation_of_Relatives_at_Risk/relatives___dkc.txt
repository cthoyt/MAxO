It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

Evaluations can include:

Telomere length testing;

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Individuals with DC who become pregnant may develop pancytopenia or existing cytopenias may worsen. They should be followed closely by a perinatologist.
