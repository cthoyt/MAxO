If the genetic status of an at-risk male relative has not been established during pregnancy, genetic testing should be performed as soon as possible after birth to clarify genetic status so that glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid hormone replacement therapy can be initiated without delay and adrenal crises can be avoided. Biochemical testing after birth should be undertaken if the genetic status of an at-risk male is unknown and the child should be closely monitored in the first few days of life. A salt-losing crisis usually takes at least seven days to manifest, during which the child is continuing to lose sodium. Initial biochemical tests of electrolytes and basal cortisol may be within normal ranges but may gradually change. The aim is to avoid a clinical salt-losing crisis.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
