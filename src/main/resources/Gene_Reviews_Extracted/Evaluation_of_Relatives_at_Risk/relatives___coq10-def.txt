Given the importance of early CoQ10 supplementation, it is appropriate to evaluate the sibs of a proband who has primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency in order to identify as early as possible those sibs who would benefit from early initiation of treatment.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known and the diagnosis has been established by biochemical findings, one can consider measuring CoQ10 levels in skin fibroblasts of at-risk sibs [Desbats et al 2015b].

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
