Sibs or relatives who have clinical features similar to those of the individual with BBS warrant genetic consultation. If the relative is deemed affected, molecular genetic testing, consultation with an ophthalmologist, and a renal sonogram to evaluate for structural renal malformations are recommended.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Expectant mothers affected with BBS require close monitoring for any deterioration in renal function or pregnancy-related complications due to structural abnormalities of the reproductive tract.
