Pregnancy Management

The management of pregnant women with PNDM should conform to the guidelines for treatment of other forms of diabetes during gestation [American Diabetes Association 2016b]. Glycemic control during gestation is not only important to prevent complications in the mother, but also to prevent fetal overgrowth (due to fetal hyperinsulinemia triggered by the excess of maternal glucose crossing the placenta) and associated complications. Referral to a maternal-fetal medicine specialist should be considered. In addition, high resolution ultrasonography and fetal echocardiography should be offered during pregnancy to screen for congenital anomalies in the fetus.

Until recently, insulin was the mainstay of therapy of diabetes during pregnancy; however, emerging data support the safety and efficacy of glyburide in the treatment of diabetes during pregnancy [Moretti et al 2008]. Thus, in women with PNDM treated with glyburide before pregnancy, it is reasonable to continue this treatment if appropriate glycemic control can be achieved.
