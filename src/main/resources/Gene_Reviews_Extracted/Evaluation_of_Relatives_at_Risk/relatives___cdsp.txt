Sibs of affected individuals should be tested by measuring plasma carnitine concentrations. If the carnitine levels are low, further evaluation for CDSP is recommended by molecular genetic testing if the SLC22A5 pathogenic variants have been identified in the family or fibroblast carnitine transport assay.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy is a metabolically challenging state because energy consumption significantly increases. In addition, plasma carnitine levels are physiologically lower during pregnancy than those of non-pregnant controls. Affected women can have decreased stamina or worsening of cardiac arrhythmia during pregnancy, suggesting that CDSP may manifest or exacerbate during pregnancy [Schimmenti et al 2007, El-Hattab et al 2010]. Therefore, all pregnant women with CDSP, including those who are asymptomatic, require close monitoring of plasma carnitine levels and increased carnitine supplementation as needed to maintain normal plasma carnitine levels.
