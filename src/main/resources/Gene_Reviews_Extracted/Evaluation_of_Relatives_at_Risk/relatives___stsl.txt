Early diagnosis of at-risk relatives either through measurement of plasma concentrations of plant sterols or through molecular genetic testing (if the family-specific pathogenic variants are known) allows early institution of treatment and surveillance to optimize outcome.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Guidelines for the management of women with sitosterolemia during pregnancy have not been established.

While ezetimibe is indicated as therapy for individuals with sitosterolemia, no studies have been published on the fetal effects of ezetimibe when used during human pregnancy. Therefore, ezetimibe should be used with caution during pregnancy.
