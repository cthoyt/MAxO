Pregnancy Management

The management of a pregnant woman with a KCNQ3 pathogenic variant is the same as that of any other pregnant woman with a history of (or at risk for) epilepsy:

No medication is indicated if (a) the woman has been seizure free and is not taking medication or (b) the woman has no history of seizures.

Antiepileptic drug treatment may be continued for active epilepsy during pregnancy.

In general, women with epilepsy or a seizure disorder from any cause are at greater risk for mortality during pregnancy than pregnant women without a seizure disorder; use of antiepileptic medication during pregnancy reduces this risk. However, exposure to antiepileptic medication may increase the risk for adverse fetal outcome (depending on the drug used, the dose, and the stage of pregnancy at which medication is taken). Nevertheless, the risk of an adverse outcome to the fetus from antiepileptic medication exposure is often less than that associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Therefore, use of antiepileptic medication to treat a maternal seizure disorder during pregnancy is typically recommended. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given antiepileptic drug during pregnancy should ideally take place prior to conception. Transitioning to a lower-risk medication prior to pregnancy may be possible [Sarma et al 2016].
