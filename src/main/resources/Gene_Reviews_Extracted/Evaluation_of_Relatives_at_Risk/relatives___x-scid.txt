It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic at-risk male relatives of an affected individual by molecular genetic testing of the IL2RG pathogenic variant in the family in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

When the pathogenic variant in the family is known, prenatal diagnosis of at-risk males allows preparation for bone marrow transplantation to be initiated before birth. Most couples at risk of having an affected male have desired prenatal testing to help prepare for optimal treatment of an affected newborn: bone marrow transplantation centers were chosen, HLA testing of family members and the prenatal sample was carried out, and a search for a marrow donor could be initiated [Puck et al 1997a].

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
