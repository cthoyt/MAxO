It is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from treatment and preventive measures (e.g., early intervention in young children with profound hearing loss, estrogen replacement to facilitate pubertal development, and potential oocyte cryopreservation if primary ovarian insufficiency is considered). See Treatment of Manifestations.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known, screening of siblings should be arranged to include audiologic assessment in males and females and baseline serum measurements of LH and FSH in females.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
