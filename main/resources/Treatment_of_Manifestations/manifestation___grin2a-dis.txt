Speech/language deficits. Individuals with significant speech/language deficits may benefit from therapy by a speech pathologist. The therapies, which are individualized to the specific speech disorder, often include linguistic approaches and augmentative and alternative communication [Murray et al 2014].

Seizures, if present, should be treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Many different AEDs may be effective, and no one medication has been demonstrated to be effective specifically for GRIN2A-related disorders.

In one individual a good response to refractory epilepsy was achieved with topiramate [Venkateswaran et al 2014].

In one individual seizure burden was reduced with the addition of memantine; however, cognitive function did not improve [Pierson et al 2014].

Ketogenic diet and vagal nerve stimulator may also be considered in patients with refractory epilepsy.

Treatment for epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spike-and-wave during sleep (ECSWS) and Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS) includes AEDs such as valproic acid, benzodiazepines, and corticosteroids. Sulthiame, ethosuximide, and levetiracetam may also be effective.

Of note, intravenous immunoglobulin has not been proven to be efficacious [Striano & Capovilla 2013, Van Bogaert 2013].

Caregivers. For information on non-medical interventions and coping strategies for parents or caregivers of children diagnosed with epilepsy, see Epilepsy & My Child Toolkit.
