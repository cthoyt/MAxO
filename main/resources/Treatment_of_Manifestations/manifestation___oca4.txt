Ophthalmologic care is the most important part of the ongoing care for most individuals with OCA4.

The majority of individuals with albinism have significant hyperopia or myopia and astigmatism. Correction of these refractive errors with spectacles or contact lenses can improve visual acuity. Except in the very unusual individual, correction of refractive errors cannot restore visual acuity to normal because of the foveal hypoplasia.

The alternating strabismus found in most individuals with albinism is generally not associated with the development of amblyopia. Strabismus surgery is usually not required, but can be considered for cosmetic reasons if the strabismus is marked or fixed.

Photophobia is common in individuals with OCA4, but the degree of discomfort varies and does not depend entirely on the amount of melanin pigment present in the iris or skin. In general, opaque contact lenses or darkly tinted lenses do not improve visual function. Dark glasses may be helpful for individuals with albinism, but many prefer to go without dark glasses because of the reduction in vision from the dark lenses. A hat with a brim (e.g., a baseball hat with a visor) is often the best way to achieve reduction in photophobia and sun protection.

Protection from the sun through the wearing of protective clothing and the regular application of sunscreen is essential to prevent sunburn and secondary skin changes, and to decrease the risk of skin cancer in later life. Regular skin check-ups for skin cancer are recommended for adult individuals with OCA4, especially in cases of severe hypopigmentation.
