In children, the main objective is to prevent amblyopia by early correction of refractive errors. Patching is necessary when correction of the refractive error is insufficient in restoring vision.

Lensectomy should be considered in individuals with cataracts, those in whom patching does not result in improvement, those in whom the lens edge is in the middle of the pupil, and those with large degrees of astigmatism [Anteby et al 2003, Wu-Chen et al 2005].

Following lens removal, improvement of visual acuity has been observed even in individuals older than age seven years [Speedwell & Russell-Eggitt 1995].

Treatment with lensectomy must be weighed against the problems of aphakia correction in children (particularly in individuals with unilateral involvement), loss of accommodation, and the risk for secondary glaucoma and retinal detachment. All surgical procedures should therefore be planned individually by an experienced ophthalmic surgeon.

Sphincterotomy (widening of the pupil by incision of the iris at the pupillary margin) can benefit individuals with small and highly displaced pupils.

Increased intraocular pressure can in most cases be controlled by topical anti-glaucomatous medication.

It is not clear if pathogenic variants in ADAMTSL4 increase the risk for retinal detachment. However, after lensectomy or cataract surgery, retinal detachment may occur. If typical signs (e.g., floaters, lightning, a diminished visual field) appear, evaluation by an ophthalmologist should be sought as soon as possible. Treatment of retinal detachment is by standard techniques using vitrectomy and scleral buckling if necessary. It is important to examine the fellow eye for retinal degeneration.
