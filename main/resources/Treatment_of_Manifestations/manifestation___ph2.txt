Reduction of calcium oxalate supersaturation. As with PH1, conservative therapy is applied with the aim of minimizing oxalate-related renal injury and preserving renal function. Treatment of persons with preserved renal function, reviewed by Leumann & Hoppe [2001], essentially aims to improve oxalate solubility as follows:

Adequate fluid intake (>2.5 L/m2 surface area/day)

Urinary inhibitors of calcium oxalate crystallization:

Orthophosphate treatment (20-60 mg/kg body weight/day) [Leumann & Hoppe 2001] (20-60 mg/kg body weight/day)

Potassium citrate (0.1-0.15 g/kg body weight/day) [Leumann & Hoppe 2001]

Magnesium supplements (200-300 mg/day in divided doses) [Watts 1994]

Dialysis. Because the plasma oxalate concentration begins to rise when the renal clearance is less than 40 mL/min/1.73 m2, early initiation of dialysis or preemptive kidney-only transplantation is preferred. For patients in ESRD, intensive (daily) dialysis is required to maximize oxalate removal. As in PH1, the longer the individual with PH2 is on dialysis the more likely systemic oxalate deposition will occur.

Organ transplantation. Kidney transplantation alone has been used in PH2 with varying success. Careful management in the postoperative period, with attention to brisk urine output and use of calcium oxalate urinary inhibitors, minimizes the risk of allograft loss as a result of oxalate deposition.

To date, liver-kidney transplantation has not been used in PH2; however, as there is more enzyme present in the liver than in other tissues [Cregeen et al 2003], this strategy may have some merit.

Other. Pharmacologic doses of pyridoxine are used as a treatment in PH1 because of its role as cofactor for the defective enzyme. Its role in PH2 is unproven, but doses in the range of that found in typical multivitamin tablets have been used in an attempt to boost transaminases (including alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase) with glyoxylate metabolizing activity.
