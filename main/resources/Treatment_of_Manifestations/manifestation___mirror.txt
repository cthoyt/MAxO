It is important to avoid stigmatizing children and adolescents with CMM and to assure that educational opportunities including university are not lost as a result of the mirror movements.

Physicians should explain the disorder to parents and teachers, making it clear that intellectual disability is not associated.

Adaptation of the school environment (e.g., allocation of extra time during examinations and limitation of the amount of handwriting) is recommended.

Adolescents and young adults should be encouraged to consider a profession that does not require complex bimanual movements, repetitive or sustained hand movements, or extensive handwriting.
