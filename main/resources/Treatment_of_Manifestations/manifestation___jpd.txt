To date, the treatment of parkin type of early-onset Parkinson disease is not different from that of idiopathic Parkinson disease. No specific guidelines are currently available.

The motor impairment usually responds very well to low doses of dopaminergic medication and is typically sustained even after long disease duration.

The most relevant treatment-related problem is the early occurrence of levodopa-induced dyskinesias (abnormal involuntary movements) and motor fluctuations. The management of treatment-related complications is not different from the strategies applied in idiopathic Parkinson disease and includes deep brain stimulation in selected cases [Moro et al 2008].
