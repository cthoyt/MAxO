Because manifestations of 16p12.2 microdeletion are variable, treatment should be targeted to the specific problems identified. Early diagnosis and treatment facilitate the best outcome. Referral to other appropriate medical specialists is recommended based on specific signs and symptoms. Specialists may include a developmental/behavioral pediatrician, pediatric neurologist, and/or medical geneticist.

Developmental and cognitive delays. Initiate developmental therapies promptly when indicated. Cognitive testing in older children may help identify any specific learning or cognitive disabilities that could be addressed by therapies or specialized education plans.

Cardiac malformations. Individuals with 16p12.2 microdeletion and cardiac malformations should have standard treatment for the malformation, including surgical correction and prophylactic antibiotic treatments as indicated.

Epilepsy. A history suggestive of possible seizure activity should prompt referral to a neurologist for additional testing, including brain imaging and EEG, and consideration of medical intervention.

Psychiatric and/or behavior problems. In individuals of any age, signs of psychiatric or behavioral problems should prompt referral to specialists, including developmental/behavioral pediatricians, psychologists, or psychiatrists, so that formal assessments may be performed and appropriate interventions (medical, social, behavioral, and/or educational) may be made.

Hearing loss. Standard treatment should be provided for hearing loss. See Hereditary Hearing Loss and Deafness.

Other malformations. Standard treatment should be provided for any other malformations, including oro-facial clefting and renal, genitourinary, or dental anomalies.
