Treatment consists primarily of surgical intervention. Compression of a nerve canal or narrowed foramen magnum can be surgically treated.

Severe bony overgrowth of facial bones and nasal, forehead, and cranial regions can be contoured. However, surgical procedures can be technically difficult and bone regrowth is common. As severe complications have occurred, surgery is considered for conservative purposes to relieve severe symptoms caused by cranial nerve compression.
