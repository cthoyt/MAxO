Low vision aids provide benefit for those individuals with significant deterioration in visual acuity.

Stage 4c fundus lesions or choroidal neovascularization and hemorrhage can be managed by direct laser photocoagulation. Marano et al [2000] suggested a conservative approach in the treatment of choroidal neovascularization based on two individuals with Best vitelliform macular dystrophy whose visual acuity improved. No clinical trials comparing the efficacy of laser photocoagulation to conservative treatment have been conducted.

Anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) agents are the standard treatment for individuals with subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Leu et al [2007] injected intravitreal bevacizumab in a 13 year-old with Best vitelliform macular dystrophy and CNV, hastening visual recovery and regression of the CNV. Intravitreal ranibizumab has also been used with success [Querques et al 2009]. There are no reports on the use of aflibercept. Long-term follow up of these affected individuals is unknown. There are currently no clinical trials to demonstrate the effectiveness of anti-VEGF agents on CNV in Best vitelliform macular dystrophy.

Andrade et al [2003] performed photodynamic therapy (PDT) using verteporfin for CNV on one person with Best vitelliform macular dystrophy. The CNV regressed and the subretinal hemorrhage resolved. The authors suggested that PDT may be an option for treatment of CNV in Best vitelliform macular dystrophy.

Genetic counseling and occupational counseling should be offered.
