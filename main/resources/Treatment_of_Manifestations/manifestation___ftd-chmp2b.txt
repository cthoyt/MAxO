Behavioral changes and the loss of insight and judgment in individuals with FTD3 often present a considerable burden for caregivers. Information about the disease and psychological support for partners or other caregivers is essential.

The behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPSD) should be treated as in other types of FTD. There is no consensus treatment guideline for FTD3. In clinical practice those affected individuals who present with very aggressive symptoms have proven quite difficult to treat and have in some cases required high doses of antipsychotics and/or antidepressants in order to relieve the physical aggressiveness.
