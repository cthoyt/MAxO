Corrective surgeries may be required for repair of:

Cryptorchidism

Abnormal penile insertion/penoscrotal position

Cleft lip/palate

Hormone therapy may be helpful for males with micropenis. Injection of human chorionic gonadotropin and testosterone improved penile length and testicular volume in three boys with severe micropenis [Soliman et al 1998]. Hormone therapy should be initiated and monitored by a pediatric endocrinologist.

Orthodontic treatment is typically required.
