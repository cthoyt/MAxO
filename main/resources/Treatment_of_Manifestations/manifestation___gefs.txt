Care is best provided by a physician (e.g., pediatric epileptologist) familiar with the pharmacotherapy for this disorder. Seizure control is critical because children with SCN1A-related seizure disorder are at high risk for sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). In addition, prolonged acute seizures may cause permanent injury [Chipaux et al 2010, Takayanagi et al 2010].

Pharmacologic treatment focuses on the observations that abnormal SCN1A channels disproportionately affect GABA neurons [Yu et al 2006] and that the associated seizures respond optimally to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) that bind to the GABA receptor:

Clobazam (0.2-1 mg mg/kg/day), part of the standard of care in Europe, is now approved by the FDA in the US. Clobazam is FDA approved for the treatment of seizures in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome [Selmer et al 2009].

Stiripentol (30-100 mg/kg/day) is accepted by epileptologists as an effective therapeutic agent in SCN1A-related seizure disorders. It is part of the early standard of care in Europe, and is used in the US after other conventional anticonvulsants have failed. It is not approved by the FDA for use in the US, but the evidence of effectiveness in SCN1A-related epilepsy is more specific than for any other agent (based on double-blind evaluation of seizure reduction in severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (SMEI) [Chiron et al 2000]). As a result, stiripentol is not considered an “investigational” therapy. Thanh et al [2002] demonstrated efficacy of the drug when compared with placebo; only moderate side effects including drowsiness, loss of appetite, and occasional neutropenia in infants and young children were observed. In a recent US survey of 82 children with Dravet syndrome, stiripentol was found to be effective in reducing prolonged seizures [Wirrell et al 2013].Stiripentol, which acts directly on GABAA receptors [Quilichini et al 2006], is also a potent inhibitor of the hepatic enzymes CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and CYP2C19. As a result, it increases the serum concentration of several common AEDs, including valproic acid, clobazam, and its metabolite nor-clobazam [Thanh et al 2002]. Doses above 50 mg/kg/day are usually not tolerated when used in conjunction with valproic acid and clobazam.Children older than age 12 years may not tolerate stiripentol because of digestive tract side effects and nausea [Thanh et al 2002].

Benzodiazepines. Individuals taking stiripentol must exercise caution in the use of benzodiazepines [Thanh et al 2002]. A single infusion of diazepam and clonazepam appears to be safe [Thanh et al 2002].

Topiramate [Coppola et al 2002]

Valproic acid (10-30 mg/kg/day) [Thanh et al 2002]

Ethosuximide. Can be effective for absence seizures. The dose is usually limited by gastrointestinal side effects, which can be minimized by more frequent dosing.

Levetiracetam (20-80 mg/kg/day). Often effective, but may make seizures worse in some individuals [Caraballo et al 2010].

Potassium bromide. Not FDA-approved in the US, but widely used in Japan with reasonable effectiveness [Tanabe et al 2008].

Phenobarbital. Although effective, phenobarbital is poorly tolerated because of its effects on cognition. When it is taken in combination with stiripentol, the serum concentration of phenobarbital is increased because stiripentol slows the metabolism and excretion of barbiturates.

Ketogenic diet.

Dressler et al [2010] report that seizures were reduced by more than 50% in 62.5% of persons with Dravet syndrome who stayed on the diet for six months. The findings of Nabbout et al [2011] in 15 individuals also support the use of the ketogenic diet in Dravet syndrome.

Sleep deprivation and illness can exacerbate SCN1A-related seizures; thus, good sleep hygiene should be encouraged. Comorbidity with sleep apnea can also occur frequently in individuals with epilepsy [Malow et al 2000], and can influence seizure control, behavior, and cognition. Polysomnography should be considered if obstructive or central sleep apnea is suspected.

Due to the sedating effects of seizure medications and the possibility of respiratory depression (especially with benzodiazepines and barbiturates), parents are advised to take a CPR course. Routine seizure and personal safety counseling is indicated.

Seizures are not always responsive to conventional AEDs. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the following drugs/treatment modalities may be effective for SCN1A-related SMEI seizures [Dravet et al 2002]:

Ethosuximide and high-dose piracetam for myoclonic seizures

Corticosteroids

Immunoglobulins

Non-medical interventions that families have reported to be helpful include the following [Nolan et al 2008]:

Placement of an indwelling venous access device

Creating a portable microenvironment

Having a written emergency department protocol

Establishing emergency routines for the family

Assigning a parent on call to lessen the effect on the siblings

Creating personal time to decrease parent stress

Finding respite care

Contacting an internet support group
