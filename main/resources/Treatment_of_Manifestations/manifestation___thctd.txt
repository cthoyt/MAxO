Note: Thyroid hormone treatment with replacement doses during childhood has no beneficial effect. However, combined treatment with high doses of levothyroxine (L-T4) and propylthiouracil (PTU), which inhibits deiodinase 1, has been shown to ameliorate the hypermetabolic state, with beneficial effects on body weight and heart rate, as seen in several affected individuals [WÃ©meau et al 2008, Visser et al 2013].
