Levodopa

Children. Although an initial dose of 25 mg levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitor (DCI) two to three times a day was recommended by Nygaard et al [1991], an initial dose of 25 mg or less of levodopa/DCI once a day is currently suggested [Furukawa et al 2005] because some children with GTP cyclohydrolase 1-deficient dopa-responsive dystonia (GTPCH1-deficient DRD) demonstrated a remarkable response to smaller doses and a child with the dystonia with motor delay phenotype manifested very severe dyskinesia (lasting 4 days) after receiving a single 50-mg dose of levodopa/DCI. Changing the dose slowly and by small increments is recommended.

Adults. An initial dose of 50 mg levodopa/DCI once or twice a day is suggested [Furukawa et al 2005]. Gradual increase to higher doses is recommended.

Motor benefit can be recognized immediately or within a few days of starting levodopa therapy; full benefit occurs within several days to a few months. Maximum benefit (complete or near-complete responsiveness of symptoms) is usually achieved by less than 300-400 mg/day of levodopa/DCI or by less than 20-30 mg/kg/day of levodopa without a DCI [Nygaard et al 1993a, Segawa & Nomura 1993, Steinberger et al 2000, Grimes et al 2002, Furukawa et al 2005]. According to Nygaard & Duvoisin [1999], no dose of levodopa/DCI greater than 400 mg/day has been necessary for individuals with GTPCH1-deficient DRD.

At the initiation of levodopa treatment, some individuals with GTPCH1-deficient DRD develop dyskinesias. However, these dyskinesias subside following dose reduction and do not reappear with later gradual increment in dose. It is important to note that such transient dyskinesias are different from those observed in early-onset parkinsonism and idiopathic Parkinson disease during chronic levodopa therapy. A continued stable response to levodopa therapy and no motor-adverse effects (motor response fluctuations and dopa-induced dyskinesias) for more than 30 years have been confirmed in GTPCH1-deficient DRD [Furukawa et al 2005].
