Treatment is supportive.

Osteopenia and osteolysis

At present no specific therapy can alleviate the progressive osteopenia.

Assure that daily requirements of vitamin D and calcium are met.

Pamidronate is probably not effective [Phadke et al 2007].

Steroids and immunosuppressants have been used without much benefit and are best avoided given their side effects [Al-Mayouf et al 2000, Zankl et al 2007, Tuysuz et al 2009, Castberg et al 2013, Ekbote et al 2014].

Joints

Physical therapy may slow the rate of development of contractures and prolong mobility.

Surgical release of contractures may not help [Author, personal observation].

Aids to ensure mobility (wheelchair and walking aids) may be needed as the disease progresses.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may not provide sufficient relief. Referral to a rheumatologist or pain clinic may be beneficial to develop an individual pain management plan.

Cardiac manifestations. Provide medical or surgical interventions as appropriate.
