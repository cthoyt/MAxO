Affected individuals should be monitored by a cardiologist who is knowledgeable about ARVC. Management of individuals with ARVC is complicated by its variable course and the limited specificity of clinical findings to predict arrhythmia risk. Management should be individualized and based on the specific results of detailed clinical and genetic investigation.

Management is focused on prevention of syncope, cardiac arrest, and sudden death (see Prevention of Primary Manifestations).

Beta blockers are considered first line therapy. Although their efficacy has not been shown in a randomized, prospective clinical trial, beta blockers are recommended [Yancy et al 2013, Corrado et al 2015].

Amiodarone may also be effective [Corrado et al 2015].

The mainstay of arrhythmia prevention relies on device insertion and management. Risk-benefit analysis for device insertion and management should be balanced against clinical risk stratification for arrhythmias.

Education regarding sudden death risk to affected adults and parents of affected children is an important aspect of management.

Physical exercise ‒ specifically regular, intense exercise ‒ is thought to promote ARVC and its associated arrhythmias. Therefore, those with fully diagnosed ARVC are usually recommended to reduce or eliminate prolonged exercise and participation in competitive sports [James et al 2013]. Supporting this idea that intense exercise hastens the onset of ARVC, Ruwald et al [2015] reported that a history of participation in competitive sports was associated with an earlier age of onset. These findings support the notion that intense exercise can induce ARVC even in the absence of an identifiable genetic predisposition.

Heart transplantation is considered when ARVC has progressed to right or left ventricular heart failure. Severe diffuse biventricular involvement simulating dilated cardiomyopathy and requiring heart transplantation appears to be rare.
