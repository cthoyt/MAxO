Specific treatment for SCA36 is currently not available. The therapeutic approach should be multidisciplinary and include the following:

Physical and occupational therapy to improve gait, balance, and fine motor coordination. Special attention should be paid to activities of daily life.

Regular physical exercise and weight control to reduce the effect of future balance and walking problems

Walking aids to facilitate ambulation and mobility. The use of a wheelchair is rare; however, it may be necessary in advanced disease stages. Living space may need to be adapted to help with accessibility.

Speech therapy and communication devices for those with dysarthria

Dietary assessment and feeding therapy programs to improve dysphagia and reduce the risk of aspiration

Depending on the severity of hearing loss and the relative impairment at different levels of the auditory tract, consideration of hearing aids on a case by case basis. The utility of cochlear implants in SCA36 is unknown; however, they have been proposed for central auditory impairment in other neurodegenerative ataxias [Frewin et al 2013]. Audiologic rehabilitation and speech therapy can help improve the ability to distinguish words and speech patterns from background sounds, while also taking into account the dysarthria in the therapy program.

Management of emotional and cognitive decline through cognitive therapy, treatment of depression, and psychological support.
