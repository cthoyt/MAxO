As for most mitochondrial diseases, no specific curative treatment for mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome and NARP exists [Kanabus et al 2014]. Supportive management includes treatment of the following:

Acidosis. Sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate for acute exacerbations of acidosis

Seizures. Appropriate antiepileptic drugs tailored to the type of seizure under the supervision of a neurologist. Sodium valproate and barbiturates should be avoided because of their inhibitory effects on the mitochondrial respiratory chain [Anderson et al 2002].

Dystonia

Benzhexol, baclofen, tetrabenazine, and gabapentin may be useful, alone or in various combinations; an initial low dose should be started and gradually increased until symptom control is achieved or intolerable side effects occur.

Botulinum toxin injection has also been used in individuals with Leigh syndrome and severe intractable dystonia.

Cardiomyopathy. Anticongestive therapy may be required and should be supervised by a cardiologist.

Regular assessment of daily caloric intake and adequacy of dietary structure including micronutrients and feeding management is indicated.

Psychological support for the affected individual and family is essential.
