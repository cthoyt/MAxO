Nonspecific therapies have been shown to be effective in numerous chronic glomerular diseases and should be initiated. The judicious use of these agents, along with optimal blood pressure control, may be of benefit in individuals with DDD/MPGNII.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers decrease proteinuria in many glomerular diseases and slow the progression to renal failure [Ruggenenti et al 1999, Brenner et al 2001]. A retrospective study found that the combination of angiotensin blockers and immunosuppressants (steroids) is more effective than each therapy alone in preventing the development of renal failure [Nasr et al 2009].

Lipid-lowering agents, and in particular hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, may delay progression of renal disease as well as correct endothelial cell dysfunction and alter long-term atherosclerotic risks in the presence of hyperlipidemia [Nickolas et al 2003, Maisch & Pezzillo 2004]. These agents are not widely used in children.

Renal allografts. Fewer than 200 individuals with DDD/MPGNII have undergone transplantation [Braun et al 2005]. Five-year allograft survival approximates 50%, which is significantly worse than for the NAPRTCS database as a whole (p=0.001). Living-related donor grafts fare better than deceased donor grafts (p<0.005). Allograft survival appears to be age-dependent in DDD; the survival of pediatric DDD transplant recipients is significantly worse than the rest of the pediatric transplant population [Angelo et al 2011].

DDD/MPGNII recurs in nearly all grafts and is the predominant cause of graft failure in 15%-50% of transplant recipients [Appel et al 2005, Angelo et al 2011]. There are little data to suggest that any therapeutic interventions have an effect on reversing this course, although isolated reports have described the use of plasmapheresis, which appears to be of equivocal benefit [FrÃ©meaux-Bacchi et al 1994, Kurtz & Schlueter 2002].
