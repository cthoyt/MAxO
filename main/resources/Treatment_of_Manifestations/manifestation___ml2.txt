Supportive and symptomatic management is indicated.

Joint. No measures are effective in treating the progressive limitation of motion in large and small joints. The classic physiotherapeutic early intervention programs that are often beneficial in children with developmental delay, neuromotor delay, or cerebral palsy cannot be recommended unequivocally in ML II because of the following:

Stretching exercises are ineffective and painful.

The unknowing therapist may inflict damage to the surrounding joint capsule and adjacent tendons and cause subsequent soft tissue calcification.

Therapies that are “low impact” in regard to joint and tendon strain, including short sessions of aqua therapy, are usually well tolerated.

Cognitive. Intellectual impairment in ML II is rarely severe. It is often milder than the adverse impression created by the significantly impaired development of speech: any well-adapted program of cognitive stimulation such as interactive play is recommended, such as a stimulation program that favors alertness, imitative skills, ambition, and even some active motion. Occupational and speech therapy are important, the former being the more effective of the two.

Dental. Severe gingival thickening can compromise routine dental cleaning. Mouth pain, infections, and even abscesses have been successfully treated with gingivectomy in some patients (see Prevention of Secondary Complications).

Otic. Myringotomy tube placement for recurrent ear infections is common but should not be considered a routine procedure because of the unique airway issues and hence risk associated with anesthesia (see Prevention of Secondary Complications).
