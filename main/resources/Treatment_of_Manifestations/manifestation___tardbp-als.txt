The management of TARDBP-related ALS is identical to that of ALS resulting from other causes, and is outlined in the American Academy of Neurology practice parameter on this topic [Miller et al 2009a, Miller et al 2009b].

Spasticity can be treated with a spasmolytic such as baclofen or a benzodiazepine.

Pseudobulbar affect can be treated with a tricyclic antidepressant or combination of quinidine and dextromethorphan.

Sialorrhea is often managed with anticholinergic medications (tricyclic antidepressants, scopolamine, atropine drops) or botulinum toxin injection of the salivary glands.

Antidepressants are often required to treat concurrent depression.

Riluzole is the only FDA-approved treatment for any type of ALS. Although there are no efficacy data specifically for TARDBP-related ALS, strong consideration should be given to its use [Miller et al 2007].

Note: See Author Notes, Miller Laboratory for a link to investigative reports on accurate assessments of the risks and benefits of specific proposed therapies.
