Liver PhK Deficiency

Hypoglycemia

can be prevented with frequent daytime feedings that are high in complex carbohydrates and protein.

The dose of cornstarch can range from 0.6 to 2.5 g/kg every six hours based on clinical symptoms.

Protein should be given as 15% to 25% of total calories (tailored to the patient’s age) as long as renal function is normal. Protein provides an alternative source of glucose via intact gluconeogenesis.

For signs of

hypoglycemia or ketosis, Polycose® or fruit juice should be given orally (if oral intake is tolerated) followed by a snack high in complex carbohydrates and protein. Blood glucose and ketone concentrations should be monitored periodically to ensure that they return to normal. If oral intake is not tolerated, an IV should be started. An initial glucose bolus (D50, or D10 if D50 not available) may be needed to maintain blood glucose concentrations above 70 mg/dL. The bolus can then be followed by 10% dextrose by IV.

Symptomatic management of liver manifestations such as cirrhosis, liver failure, portal hypertension is appropriate.

Muscle PhK Deficiency

Signs and symptoms should be managed as with other muscle GSDs, such as GSD III [Kishnani et al 2010].

Physical therapy evaluation and intervention based on physical status and function

Coordination with a metabolic nutritionist regarding monitoring and optimizing blood glucose concentrations based on levels of exercise and activity
