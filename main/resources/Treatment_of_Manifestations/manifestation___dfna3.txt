Early diagnosis, habilitation with hearing aids or cochlear implantation, and educational programming will diminish the likelihood of long-term speech or educational delay.

The following are indicated:

Fitting with appropriate hearing aids

Enrollment in an appropriate educational program for the hearing impaired

Consideration of cochlear implantation, an effective habilitation option for persons with preserved residual hearing [Gantz et al 2016]

Recognition that unlike with many clinical conditions, management and treatment of mild-to-profound deafness fall largely within the purview of the social welfare and educational systems rather than the medical care system [Smith et al 2005]

See Hereditary Hearing Loss and Deafness for more detailed discussion of management issues.
