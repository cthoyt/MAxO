Wounds on neuropathic limbs heal if they are clean and protected and the limb is rested. Principles of treatment are the same as for leprosy surgery; see Warren & Nade [1999].

Foot drop can be treated with ankle/foot orthotics (AFOs), but these need sleeving with stockings or some form of second skin to prevent skin abrasion.

Charcot joints may require arthrodesis.

Shooting pains are difficult to treat and only partial relief can be obtained with carbamazepine, gabapentin, or amitryptiline, or a combination of an antiepileptic and an antidepressant. Opiates are contraindicated as HSN1A is a chronic disorder.
