Individuals with CMT4H are often evaluated and managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes neurologists, physiatrists, orthopedic surgeons, and physical and occupational therapists [Carter et al 1995, Grandis & Shy 2005].

Treatment is symptomatic and may include the following:

Ankle/foot orthoses (AFOs) to correct foot drop and aid walking [Carter et al 1995]

Physiotherapy with daily heel cord stretching exercises to help prevent Achilles' tendon shortening and physical activity adapted to the abilities of each individual to prevent contractures and help preserve flexibility

Orthopedic surgery to correct severe pes cavus deformity [Guyton & Mann 2000, Ward et al 2008]

Surgery to correct spine deformities

Forearm crutches or canes for gait stability

Wheelchairs as needed because of gait instability

Treatment of musculoskeletal pain with acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [Carter et al 1998]
