Treatment protocols for cherubism are not well established since both ends of the spectrum (mild clinically unrecognized cases and severe cases with extensive bone loss) are seen. Given that cherubism is considered to be a self-limited condition that improves over time, treatment should be tailored to the individual's needs. Depending on the severity, surgery may be needed for functional and esthetic concerns.

Children with cherubism should be referred to a craniofacial clinic with pediatric experience for evaluation. A craniofacial clinic associated with a major pediatric medical center usually includes a surgical team, medical geneticist, dentist, orthodontic specialist, ophthalmologist, and social worker.

Surgical interventions include curettage with or without bone grafting [Kozakiewicz et al 2001, Roginsky et al 2009]. Liposuction has also been used successfully to re-contour the jaws. Surgical interventions are likely to occur between ages five to 15 years in individuals with disfiguring enlargement of jaws or locally aggressive lesions associated with complications.

Orthodontic treatment is commonly required as the jaw distortion leads to permanent dental abnormalities including a malocclusive bite, premature loss of deciduous teeth, and widely spaced, misplaced, unerupted, or absent permanent teeth.

Ophthalmologic treatment is necessary in rare individuals in whom orbital manifestations such as lower lid retraction, proptosis, diplopia, globe displacement, and visual loss caused by optic atrophy are present.
