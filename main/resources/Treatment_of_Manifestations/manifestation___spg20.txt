Treatment for spasticity is presently limited to reducing muscle spasticity through exercise and medication, especially Lioresal®, which is given either orally or via intrathecal pump. Dosages need to be individualized as some patients have mainly weakness with less spasticity (and thus do not benefit from large doses), while others have significant spasticity and require high doses. Tizanidine, dantrolene (see, however, Agents/Circumstances to Avoid), and Botox® have also been useful in reducing muscle spasticity.

It is recommended that affected individuals participate in daily physical therapy designed to:

Maintain and improve muscle flexibility and range of motion (stretching exercises);

Improve muscle strength (through resistance exercise);

Maintain walking reflexes (walking on a slowly moving treadmill with arm supports or walking in a swimming pool); and

Improve cardiovascular fitness.

These recommendations are based on the experience of approximately 200 persons with hereditary spastic paraplegia, who nearly unanimously reported benefit from daily physical exercise [Fink 2003].

Occupational therapy, assistive walking devices, and ankle-foot orthotics as needed are appropriate.

Oxybutynin is helpful in reducing urinary urgency.

Antidepressants or mood stabilizers can be prescribed to manage emotional lability.
