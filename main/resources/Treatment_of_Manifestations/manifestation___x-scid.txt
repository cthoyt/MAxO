The current goals of treatment include prophylaxis for infections and preemptive bone marrow transplant (BMT) prior to the development of symptoms (see Prevention of Primary Manifestations).

An individual diagnosed with X-SCID requires emergent treatment to provide a functional immune system.

Interim management includes treatment of infections and use of immunoglobulin infusions and antibiotics, particularly prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly Pneumocystis carinii) and, in most cases, fungal infections.

Isolation from exposure to CMV (breast milk, young children, blood products) is indicated.
