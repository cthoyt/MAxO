Neurosurgical complications (hydrocephalus and cerebellar tonsillar ectopia). Findings warranting neurosurgical referral include rapidly enlarging OFC, obstructive hydrocephalus, symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, and progressive or symptomatic cerebellar tonsillar ectopia (CBTE) or Chiari malformation. Early treatment of hydrocephalus may reduce the risk for progressive CBTE, but data to determine the most appropriate neurosurgical management are lacking.

Feeding difficulties such as chewing and swallowing difficulties and dysphagia require evaluation by a feeding specialist and/or gastroenterologist to promote early identification and prompt intervention which may include dietary modification and/or placement of a gastrostomy (G) tube.

Speech therapy is indicated for difficulties with speech, swallowing, and feeding.

Epilepsy may require long-term antiepileptic treatment.

Developmental delays. Initiation of physical, occupational, and speech therapy is recommended within the first year of life.
