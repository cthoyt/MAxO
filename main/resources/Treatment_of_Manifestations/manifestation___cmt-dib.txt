Treatment of DI-CMTB is symptomatic and involves evaluation and management by a multidisciplinary team that includes neurologists, orthopedic surgeons, and physical and occupational therapists. Due to the great phenotypic variability, disease treatment should be tailored to the individualâ€™s needs.

Treatment may include:

Ankle/foot orthoses

Orthopedic surgery

Forearm crutches or canes; rarely, wheelchairs

Treatment of musculoskeletal pain with acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs)

Career and employment counseling
