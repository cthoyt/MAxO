Guidance by a lymphedema therapist regarding management of edema (e.g., fitting stockings, massage) is important. Although the edema cannot be cured, some improvement is usually possible with the use of properly fitted compression hosiery and/or bandaging and well fitting, supportive shoes. Toe gloves may be of benefit and good skin care is essential. Such treatment measures may improve the cosmetic appearance of the limb, decrease the size of the limb, and reduce the risk of complications.
