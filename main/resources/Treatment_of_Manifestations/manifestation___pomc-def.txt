The main treatment for POMC deficiency is hormone replacement therapy with glucocorticoids with other hormones as required, as well as skin care in the sun.

Adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency is treated in the usual manner with hydrocortisone replacement therapy. Care by a pediatric endocrinologist is recommended.

Severe obesity. Hyperphagic obesity is recognized in the neonatal period and persists into adolescence and adulthood. At present, there is no recognized effective medical therapy to prevent weight gain; therefore, lifestyle measures should be instigated.

Fair skin. The individual may need appropriate verbal and written sun care advice (avoidance of sun exposure in the middle 4 hours of the day [i.e., 10 am - 2 pm], cover-up clothing, high-factor sunscreen). Discussion about the potential lifelong risk for skin cancer is recommended.

Hypothyroidism. The mild central hypothyroidism reported in POMC deficiency is treated with levothyroxine. Importantly, thyroid hormone replacement should not be initiated until adrenal function has been evaluated and adrenal insufficiency (if present) has been treated. Care by a pediatric endocrinologist is recommended.

Growth hormone (GH) deficiency. Adolescent-onset GH deficiency (a rare manifestation of POMC deficiency) is treated with daily subcutaneous GH injections. Care by a pediatric endocrinologist is recommended.

Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Adolescent-onset hypogonadism (a rare manifestation of POMC deficiency) can be treated with sex hormone replacement. Care by an endocrinologist experienced in treating this disorder is recommended.
