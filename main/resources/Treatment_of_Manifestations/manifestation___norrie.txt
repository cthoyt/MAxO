Ocular manifestations

The majority of males with the classic Norrie disease (ND) phenotype have complete retinal detachment at the time of birth; therefore, interventional therapy may not offer much with regard to preservation of sight. Ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted..

Individuals without complete retinal detachment may benefit from surgery and/or laser therapy with the potential for improved outcomes if done at an early age.

A report by Chow et al [2010] described successful laser photocoagulation at birth (37 weeksâ€™ gestation) of a male with ND in which Teller visual acuity was measured at 20/100 O.D. at 23 months of life

Retrospective medical record review of all patients seen in a tertiary care pediatric retinal clinical practice (1988-2008) of 14 males with ND documented maintenance of light perception in at least one eye (7/14 cases) with early vitrectomy done by age 12 months (median 4.5 months) [Walsh et al 2010].

In the progressive stage of the Norrie disease phenotype, development of increased intraocular pressure may require surgery. Rarely, enucleation of the eye is required to control pain.

Sensorineural hearing loss

Hearing aid augmentation is usually successful well into middle or late adulthood.

Cochlear implantation should be considered when hearing-assisted audiologic function is significantly impaired.

Behavioral issues are a lifelong challenge to many individuals with Norrie disease and to their guardians/caretakers, whether or not intellectual disability or cognitive impairment is present. Intervention and therapy are supportive and aimed at maximizing educational opportunities.

An empiric trial of psychotropic medications may be warranted, although no studies have addressed or supported the use of specific medications for treatment of Norrie disease.
