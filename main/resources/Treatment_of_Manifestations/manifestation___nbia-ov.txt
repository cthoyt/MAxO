Treatments for NBIA are palliative. The following treatments should be considered (some do not apply to all subtypes of NBIA):

Pharmacologic treatment of spasticity and seizures

Trial of oral or intrathecal baclofen for those with significant dystonia

Botulinum toxin for those with focal dystonia

L-DOPA treatment, which is beneficial in rare cases. Note: Some will have an initially dramatic response that usually diminishes over time; some will develop prominent dyskinesias early in the treatment

Deep brain stimulation, used clinically for dystonia with increasing frequency; shows some evidence of benefit (see Therapies Under Investigation).

Psychiatric treatment for those with a later-onset, more protracted course accompanied by neuropsychiatric symptoms

As NBIA progresses, many affected individuals may experience episodes of extreme dystonia lasting for day or weeks. It is especially important during these episodes to evaluate for treatable causes of pain, which may include occult GI bleeding, urinary tract infections, and occult bone fractures. The combination of osteopenia in a non-ambulatory person with marked stress on the long bones from dystonia places many individuals with NBIA at high risk for fractures without apparent trauma.
