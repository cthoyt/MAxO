Care by a nephrologist is recommended.

Treatment follows standard guidelines for chronic kidney disease – based on the level of the serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) – and its sequelae, which can include hypertension, anemia, and gout. Affected individuals are encouraged to prepare for kidney transplantation, the definitive treatment of ADTKD-MUC1, by staying in optimal health (e.g., by exercising, avoiding obesity and tobacco usage, and maintaining strict control of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and other cardiovascular risk factors).

Transplantation is curative, and the outcome from kidney transplantation in this group of patients is excellent.
