Severe neurodegenerative form (NPD-A)

Progressive neurologic disease. Physical and occupational therapy to maximize function and to prevent contractures is appropriate. Aggressive therapy is not warranted and the plan for such treatment should be made in consultation with the neurologist, therapist(s), and family to establish realistic goals.

Nutrition. Feeding difficulties can make provision of adequate calories a major challenge. Regular consultation with a dietician should be provided. The use of nasogastric tube feeding or surgical placement of a feeding tube should be discussed with the family.

Sleep disorder. Irritability and sleep disturbance are quality-of-life issues for the entire family that sometimes require the use of sedatives.

NPD-B

Bleeding. Most affected individuals have thrombocytopenia. When bleeding is life threatening, transfusion of blood products is indicated. While partial splenectomy may be considered for individuals with severe hypersplenism, total splenectomy should be avoided because removal of the spleen exacerbates the pulmonary disease.

Pulmonary disease. Individuals with symptomatic pulmonary disease may require supplemental oxygen. Other measures to treat interstitial lung disease, such as steroids, have not been well studied. Several individuals have undergone bronchopulmonary lavage with variable results [Nicholson et al 2002].

Hyperlipidemia. Adults with hyperlipidemia should be treated to bring the serum concentration of total cholesterol into the normal range.

Growth retardation. Dietary assessment is indicated in all cases to assure that calorie intake is adequate for growth.

Note: Orthotopic liver transplantation in an infant with NPD-A and amniotic cell transplantation in several individuals with NPD-B have been attempted with little or no success [Kayler et al 2002].
