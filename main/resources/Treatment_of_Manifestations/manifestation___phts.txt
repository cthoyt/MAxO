The mucocutaneous manifestations of Cowden syndrome are rarely life threatening:

If asymptomatic, observation alone is prudent.

Cutaneous lesions should be excised only if malignancy is suspected or symptoms (e.g., pain, deformity, increased scarring) are significant.When symptomatic, topical agents (e.g., 5-fluorouracil), curettage, cryosurgery, or laser ablation may provide only temporary relief [Hildenbrand et al 2001]. Surgical excision is sometimes complicated by cheloid formation and recurrence (often rapid) of the lesions [Eng, unpublished data].

Treatment for the benign and malignant manifestations of PHTS is the same as for their sporadic counterparts.
