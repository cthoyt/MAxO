No treatment for BCD currently exists; affected individuals should be referred to services specific to those with vision impairment:

Low vision specialists can prescribe low vision aids/devices to help optimize remaining vision.

State services for the Blind or organizations/professionals trained to work with the visually impaired provide access to services related to employment, education, and counseling regarding the psychosocial adaptation to visual loss

Note: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is uncommon in BCD. Laser photocoagulation is not usually considered for CNV in inherited forms of retinal degeneration and has recently been superseded by the use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy in a fashion similar to its use in age-related macular dystrophy.
