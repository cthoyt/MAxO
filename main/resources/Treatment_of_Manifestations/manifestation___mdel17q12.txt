Treatment is symptomatic and depends on an individualâ€™s specific needs.

Renal disease. Treatment should follow standard practice.

Established guidelines for the management of chronic kidney disease, including that related to CAKUT or ADTKD, are available for children and adults [KDIGO CKD Work Group 2013].

Some individuals have normal renal function, while others may progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and require dialysis or kidney transplantation.

For those who have diabetes mellitus, simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantation has been successful and should be considered [Faguer et al 2011, Halbritter et al 2011, Poitou et al 2012].

MODY5. Treatment should follow standard practice. The clinical course tends to be progressive in terms of hyperglycemia, requiring treatment with insulin [Fajans & Bell 2011].

Neurodevelopmental/neuropsychiatric disorders. Early identification and intervention for neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., global developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety, and bipolar disorder) is important for optimal outcomes.

Specialized instruction and speech / occupational / physical / behavioral therapies should be provided if indicated.

Management of ASD should follow guidelines published by the American Academy of Pediatrics [Myers & Johnson 2007].

Psychiatric consultation and therapy is recommended for those with mental health concerns, such as mood disorders, anxiety, and/or psychosis.

Other. Cardiac, ophthalmologic, neurologic, gastrointestinal, and other conditions should be treated by the appropriate specialty according to standard guidelines.
