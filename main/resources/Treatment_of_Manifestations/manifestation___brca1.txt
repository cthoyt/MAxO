National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines suggest that women with a BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant could consider bilateral mastectomy as a primary surgical treatment of breast cancer because of their elevated rate of ipsilateral and contralateral breast cancer. See NCCN guidelines for the treatment of breast cancer and the treatment of other BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated malignancies (registration required).
