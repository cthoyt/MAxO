Parkinsonism. Dopaminergic therapy (particularly carbidopa/levodopa) should be considered in all individuals with significant parkinsonism. Response to levodopa is usually absent, erratic, or transient in Perry syndrome [Tsuboi et al 2002, Wider & Wszolek 2008]. However, large doses of carbidopa/levodopa (>2g) have been used successfully to reduce rigidity, tremor, and other symptoms in two individuals, one from the new British kindred [Newsway et al 2010] and one from the original Canadian family [J Stoessl, personal communication].

Hypoventilation. Ventilation support (invasive or noninvasive) may prolong life expectancy and have a significant impact on quality of life. Several persons without evidence of daytime central hypoventilation or respiratory troubles died suddenly at night most likely as a result of nocturnal hypoventilation. Therefore, ventilation support may be needed only during sleep [Wider & Wszolek, personal observation]. A bilateral diaphragmatic pacemaker may help combat respiratory insufficiency [Pretelt et al 2014].

Depression. Psychiatric manifestations may require antidepressants and psychiatric follow up to help reduce risk of suicide.

Weight loss. Careful weight follow up is indicated and high caloric intake should be considered if weight loss is present.
