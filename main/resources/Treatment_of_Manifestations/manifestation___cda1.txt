Intramuscular or subcutaneous injections of interferon (IFN)-α2a or INF-α2b given two or three times a week increase hemoglobin and decrease iron overload in the majority of treated individuals [Lavabre-Bertrand et al 2004]. Peginterferon-α2b has also been given once a week. The mechanism behind this response is unknown. To date, only a limited number of individuals, including infants, have been treated.Treatment should be given by a physician who is experienced in interferon administration.

Successful allogenic bone marrow transplantation has been described in three children [Ayas et al 2002] and should be considered only in those transfusion-dependent persons who are resistant to IFN therapy.

Splenectomy is of unproved value; failure of this procedure to increase hemoglobin levels and also thromboembolic complications may follow splenectomy. Therefore, splenectomy should be cautiously considered in patients with CDA I, as is recommended for non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia [Taher et al 2013].
