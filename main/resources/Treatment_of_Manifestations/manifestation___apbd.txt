Optimally, care is provided by a team that includes specialists in physical medicine rehabilitation, urology, and behavioral neurology or psychology (i.e., behavioralists) who can provide the following:

Gait safety devices including canes and wheel chairs

Consideration of antispasmodic bladder medications and in-and-out bladder catheterization vs indwelling bladder catheter depending on urologic findings

Behavioral modification and cognitive aids as needed
