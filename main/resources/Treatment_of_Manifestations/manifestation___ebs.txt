Supportive care to protect the skin from blistering, appropriate dressings that will not further damage the skin and will promote healing of open wounds, and prevention and treatment of secondary infection are the mainstays of EB treatment.

Encourage children to tailor their activities to minimize trauma to the skin while participating as much as possible in age-appropriate play.

Lance and drain new blisters to prevent further spread from fluid pressure.

Dressings usually involve three layers:

A primary nonadherent dressing that will adhere to the top layers of the epidermis must be used. There is wide variability in tolerance to different primary layers; some individuals with EBS can use ordinary bandages. Some dressings are impregnated with an emollient such as petrolatum or topical antiseptic (e.g., Vaseline® Gauze, Adaptic®, Xeroform). Nonstick products (e.g., Telfa or N-Terface®) or silicone-based products without adhesive (e.g., Mepitel® or Mepilex®) are also popular.

A secondary layer absorbs drainage, provides stability for the primary layer, and adds padding to allow more activity. Foam dressings and/or rolls of gauze (e.g., Kerlix®) are commonly used.

A tertiary layer, usually with some elastic properties, ensures the integrity of the dressing (e.g., Coban™ or elasticized tube gauze of varying diameters, such as BandNet®).

Note: Many individuals with EBS, in contrast to those with junctional EB and dystrophic EB, find that excessive bandaging may actually lead to more blistering, presumably as a result of increased heat and sweating. Such individuals may benefit from dusting the affected areas with corn starch to help absorb moisture and reduce friction on the skin, followed by a simple (i.e., one-layer) dressing.
