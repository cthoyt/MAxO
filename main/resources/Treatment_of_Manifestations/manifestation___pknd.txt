Attack frequency is reduced or prevented by the anticonvulsants phenytoin or carbamezepine, typically at lower doses than are used to treat epilepsy [Demirkiran & Jankovic 1995, McGrath & Dure 2003].

Other anticonvulsants proven to be effective include oxcarbazepine [Tsao 2004], ethosuximide [Guerrini et al 2002], lamotrigine [Pereira et al 2000], and gabapentin [Chudnow et al 1997].
