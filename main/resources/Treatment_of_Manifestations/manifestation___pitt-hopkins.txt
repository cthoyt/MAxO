The following are appropriate:

Developmental. Early infant developmental services (physical, occupational, speech therapies):

Infant feeding assessment to address early hypotonia as needed

Special education services to address delays with focus on life skills

Behavioral modification for self-injurious behavior or anxiety

Pulmonary. Some reports indicate that antiepileptic medications control seizures while leaving the unusual respiratory patterns unchanged Peippo et al [2006] and others have noted some decrease in the frequency of the episodes with the use of anticonvulsants [Takano et al 2010]. Improvement of an abnormal respiratory pattern after treatment with sodium valproate has been reported in a person with PTHS with frequent apneic episodes associated with hypoxemia [Maini et al 2012]. A recent study in two patients with PTHS demonstrated that daily treatment with acetazolamide resulted in decreased frequency and duration of hyperventilatory and apneic episodes and improved oxygen saturation [Verhulst et al 2012].

Neurologic. Treatment of epilepsy appropriate to type of seizure and individualized to the patient

Ophthalmologic. Eyeglasses or surgery as needed for amblyopia

Gastrointestinal. In most patients, regular use of high-fiber diet and/or laxative regimen to address constipation

Musculoskeletal: Orthotics for abnormal foot position to aid in ambulation. Orthopedic treatment of scoliosis as indicated.

Other. Standard care for other medical issues
