General

Adequate nutrition and weight maintenance are essential. Percutaneous gastrostomy is often appropriate to maintain adequate caloric intake in persons with significant bulbar involvement.

Joint contractures can occur, are often painful, and can interfere with care-giving. Appropriate bracing and stretching can minimize contractures.

Mitochondrial myopathy

Assistance with ambulation and posture

Surgical correction of ptosis as needed

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

(ALS). The management of CHCHD10-related ALS is identical to that of ALS due to other causes, and is outlined in the American Academy of Neurology practice parameter on this topic [Miller et al 1999].

Spasticity can be treated with a spasmolytic such as baclofen or a benzodiazepine.

Pseudobulbar affect can be treated with a tricyclic antidepressant or combination of quinidine and dextromethorphan.

Sialorrhea is often managed with anticholinergic medications (tricyclic antidepressants, scopolamine, atropine drops) or botulinum toxin injection of the salivary glands.

Antidepressants are often required to treat concurrent depression.

Riluzole is the only FDA-approved treatment for any type of ALS. Although there are no efficacy data specifically for CHCHD10-related ALS, strong consideration should be given to its use.

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Treatment follows routine practices.

Sedative or antipsychotic drugs help to reduce extreme restlessness, roaming behavior, delusions, and hallucinations.

The extrapyramidal signs are usually unresponsive or only partially responsive to L-dopa treatment.

Behavioral changes and the loss of insight and judgment in individuals with FTD often present a considerable burden for partners or other caregivers. Information about the disease and psychological support for partners or other caregivers is essential.

Spinal motor neuronopathy. The management of SMAJ is identical to that of adult-onset SMA due to other causes.
