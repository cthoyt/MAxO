The following are appropriate:

Conservative management of symptomatic distichiasis with lubrication or epilation (plucking), or more definitive management with cryotherapy, electrolysis, or lid splitting [O'Donnell & Collin 1993]. Recurrence is possible even with more definitive treatment.

Referral to a lymphedema therapist for management of edema (fitting hosiery, massage). Although the edema cannot be cured, some improvement may be possible with the use of carefully fitted hosiery and/or bandaging, which may reduce the size of the swelling as well as the discomfort associated with it.

Surgery for ptosis if clinically indicated (e.g., obscured vision, cosmetic appearance)

Referral to neurosurgery for individuals with symptomatic spinal cysts (i.e., any neurologic signs or symptoms especially in the lower limbs)

Conservative management of varicose veins if possible, as surgery could aggravate the edema and increase the risk of infection or cellulitis

Standard treatment for scoliosis
