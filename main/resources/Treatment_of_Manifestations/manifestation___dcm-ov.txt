Treatment can favorably (and at times dramatically) affect the natural history of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Management of DCM includes (1) pharmacologic therapy and (2) pacemaker and implantable cardiac defibrillator device therapy for symptomatic and asymptomatic disease. Care should be provided by physicians skilled in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with heart failure and DCM.

Symptoms include those related to heart failure, arrhythmia, or stroke. Symptomatic DCM represents late disease. Full medical therapy (ACE inhibitors, beta blockers) with evaluation for antiarrhythmic therapy (e.g., pacemakers, implantable cardiac defibrillators) should be considered by cardiovascular specialists with expertise in the field.

Individuals with idiopathic or familial dilated cardiomyopathy should:

Be counseled that idiopathic or familial dilated cardiomyopathy is treatable even prior to the onset of symptoms, that treatment may result in remission of DCM, and may forestall symptomatic disease; and that treatment of symptomatic disease (heart failure, arrhythmias, or thromboembolic disease) improves survival and quality of life;

Understand the symptoms of heart failure, arrhythmia (including presyncope and syncope), and thromboemoblic disease, and be counseled to urgently seek medical care with the new presentation of any of these symptoms.

Training of relatives and/or caregivers in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be suggested, particularly in families with a strong family history of sudden death and/or significant arrhythmias.

Cardiac transplantation remains the definitive treatment for progressive DCM and heart failure refractory to medical or device therapy.
