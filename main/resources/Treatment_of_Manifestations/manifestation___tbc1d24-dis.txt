Developmental delay. Early educational intervention, physical, occupational and speech therapy is recommended because of the high risk for motor and cognitive delay.

Seizures. Symptomatic pharmacologic management is warranted, as no controlled studies have compared the efficacy of different antiepileptic drugs in TBC1D24-related disorders.

The management of epilepsy in many genetic epilepsies is complex; general recommendations from the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence are available online.

Renal anomalies. Refer to an urologist or nephrologist as indicated.

Heart defects. Manage according to the anomalies detected.
