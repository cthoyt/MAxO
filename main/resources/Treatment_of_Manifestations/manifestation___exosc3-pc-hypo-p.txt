No specific therapy is available. Treatment is symptomatic. The main problems to manage are:

Contractures, including scoliosis, due to neurogenic atrophy, by passive or active movement and if necessary by bracing.

Prevention of aspiration due to bulbar muscle and respiratory muscle involvement

Adaptation of education to the level of cognitive handicap

Epilepsy, which is amendable to standard treatments
