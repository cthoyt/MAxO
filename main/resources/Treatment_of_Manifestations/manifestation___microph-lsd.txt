The following are appropriate:

Use of a prosthesis in severe microphthalmia and anophthalmia. In some cases ophthalmologic surgery can be considered to expand the palpebral fissures and orbit by fitting the infant with prostheses of progressively increasing size.

Considerations for surgical intervention in severe microphthalmia and anophthalmia are best made after age six months, when postnatal growth of the orbit can be assessed.

Regular care of a dermatologist for individuals with significant skin lesions

Referral to a pediatric neurologist for evaluation and treatment if microcephaly, seizures, and/or other neurologic abnormalities are present

Appropriate developmental stimulation and special education as indicated for developmental delay

Routine care for diaphragmatic hernia, cardiomyopathy, congenital heart defects, and other malformations, when present
