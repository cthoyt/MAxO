There is little objective evidence regarding management of FRDA. A multidisciplinary approach is essential for maximal benefit because FRDA affects multiple organ systems:

Prostheses, walking aids, wheelchairs, and physical therapy as prescribed by a physiatrist (rehabilitation medicine specialist) to maintain an active lifestyle

In-patient rehabilitation, which has been shown to improve physical function as measured by the Functional Independence Measure [Milne et al 2012]

Occupational therapy assessment to ensure a safe home and work environment

To manage spasticity: physical therapy including stretching programs, standing frame and splints, pharmacologic agents such as baclofen and botulinum toxin. Intrathecal baclofen can be beneficial where oral administration is unsuccessful or side effects are excessive [Berntsson et al 2013]. Orthopedic interventions, both operative and non-operative, for scoliosis [Milbrandt et al 2008] and foot deformities [Delatycki et al 2005] may be necessary.

Speech therapy to maximize communication skills

Management of dysphagia that may include dietary modification and, in the late stages of disease, use of nasogastric or gastrostomy feeding

Treatment of cardiac disease to reduce morbidity and mortality, including antiarrhythmic agents, anticardiac failure medication, anticoagulants, and pacemaker/implantable cardioverter defibrillator insertion [Lynch et al 2012a]. Cardiac transplantation is more controversial but has been used particularly when there is severe cardiac disease in the setting of mild neurologic symptoms [Sedlak et al 2004, Yoon et al 2012, McCormick et al 2017].

Antispasmodic agents for bladder dysfunction, with some individuals requiring botulinum toxin for the bladder and some requiring intermittent or permanent catheterization

Treatment of sleep apnea by continuous positive airway pressure

Treatment of diabetes mellitus with diet and, if necessary, oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin

Hearing aids, microphone, and receiver as needed [Rance et al 2010] (see also Hereditary Hearing Loss and Deafness Overview)

Psychological (counseling and/or pharmacologic) support for affected individuals and family

Prevention of Secondary Manifestations

Measures include the following:

Active management of spasticity with physiotherapy and botulinum toxin to prevent permanent contracture and the need for surgery

Treatment of scoliosis with physiotherapy, botulinum toxin, and surgery to prevent cardiopulmonary complications that can result from severe scoliosis

Treatment of diabetes mellitus to prevent complications that can arise from untreated/inadequately treated diabetes

Treatment of cardiac complications of FRDA to prevent arrhythmias that can result in mortality

Treatment of sleep apnea to prevent neurologic and cardiopulmonary complications that can result from untreated sleep apnea
