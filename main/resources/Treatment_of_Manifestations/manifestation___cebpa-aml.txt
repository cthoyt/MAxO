Management of CEBPA-associated familial AML does not differ from that of sporadic CEBPA-associated AML [National Comprehensive Cancer Network 2009, DÃ¶hner et al 2010].

Treatment usually includes cytarabine/anthracycline-based induction and cytarabine-based consolidation chemotherapy with or without HSCT according to clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular risk. For younger individuals with AML (even those without a clear family history), there is now increasing awareness that germline variants should be investigated and excluded prior to consideration of HSCT using sib/related donors. Specific treatment strategies are based on characteristics of the individual, response to chemotherapy, treatment setting, and protocol (if the individual is enrolled in a clinical trial). Note: Whenever possible, persons with AML should be treated as part of a clinical trial protocol.

Relapses are treated with cytarabine-based salvage chemotherapy followed by allogeneic HSCT (if a suitable donor is available and if cure is the intent of treatment).
