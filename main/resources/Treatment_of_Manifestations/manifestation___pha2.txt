Electrolyte and blood pressure abnormalities of PHAII are often corrected with thiazide diuretics. Metabolic abnormalities and hypertension generally improve within one week.

Different thiazide diuretics exist, with different dosing regimens. In general dosing is titrated to normalization of blood pressure. It is possible that dosing may need to be increased over time or that additional anti-hypertensives may be required to adequately control blood pressure.

There are no established guidelines regarding age at which treatment should begin for individuals with PHAII, but affected children who have hypertension are generally treated.
