At present no disease-modifying therapy exists. Management is supportive.

For distal leg weakness, use of ankle-foot orthoses can optimize independent ambulation. Later in the disease course other mobility aids such as canes, walkers, or wheelchairs may be required.

Exercises and activities suggested by physiotherapy consultation may be helpful to prevent continued loss of physical function due to inactivity.

Noninvasive ventilation with bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may be indicated for nocturnal hypoventilation initially, followed by mechanical ventilatory support as needed.

Patients have increased susceptibility to respiratory tract infections and, therefore, influenza vaccination should be prioritized.

Given the gradually progressive nature of this disease, occupational therapy and social services support are important.
