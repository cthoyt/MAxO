To identify periods of suboptimal metabolic control, blood glucose should be measured between 2 AM and 4 AM or urine ketones should be measured upon awakening at least several times per month.

Hypoglycemia is uncommon in older children and adults upon awakening since counter-regulation can raise blood glucose concentrations; however, monitoring blood glucose concentrations at 2 to 4 AM can reveal periods of suboptimal control.

Monitoring of blood ketones upon awakening at least several times per month using a portable blood ketone meter is recommended. The goal is to maintain blood beta-OH-butyrate concentrations less than 0.3 mmol/L. Alternatively morning urine ketone measurements may be assessed with regular urine dipsticks to give an overview of overnight metabolic control.

The following are appropriate annually:

Measurement of height and weight to monitor growth

Liver ultrasound examination to screen for adenomas and evidence of liver scarring. MRI scans are limited to those individuals with abnormalities on the primary ultrasound screen.

Laboratory studies: LFTs, CK, lipid profile

Echocardiogram to monitor for cardiomyopathy; ECG

Bone density measurements are recommended after growth is complete.
