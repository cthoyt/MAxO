Monthly measurement of 24-hour uric acid excretion in the urine is particularly helpful in the assessment of the response to treatment. Alternatively, a spot urinary urate/creatinine ratio can be informative if accessibility to samples is restricted.

Once a normal serum urate concentration is achieved and maintained, serum urate concentration should be monitored at a minimum annually to assure that the targeted concentration is maintained.

A 24-hour urine should also be monitored at a minimum annually for urate and xanthine concentrations particularly to ensure that urinary xanthine does not exceed solubility (<1 mmol/L); plasma xanthine is cleared efficiently and does not accumulate.

Audiometry should be repeated as deemed appropriate by treating audiologist/otolaryngologist.

Neurologic evaluation should be performed annually or more frequently as recommended by the treating neurologist.

Note: Under usual circumstances, renal functional consequences are avoided if serum urate concentration and urinary excretion of urate are normalized and urinary xanthine does not routinely exceed its solubility (~1 mmol/L).
