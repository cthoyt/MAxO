Appropriate measures include the following:

Monitoring of postnatal development of genitalia that were ambiguous at birth for changes that could lead to reconsideration of the assigned sex

For individuals assigned a male sex, evaluation during puberty for signs of gynecomastia

In adults, monitoring of bone mineral density through DEXA (dual-emission x-ray absorptiometry) scanning [Oakes et al 2008]
