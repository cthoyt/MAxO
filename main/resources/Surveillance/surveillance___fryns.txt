There are no specific surveillance guidelines for Fryns syndrome. In those who survive the neonatal period, surveillance depends on the types of malformations present and is specific to the individual.

Infants with successful CDH repair should be followed by a multidisciplinary team at a specialized center, with periodic evaluations by a pediatric surgeon, nurse specialist, cardiologist, pulmonologist, and nutritionist.
