The following is recommended given the intermittent nature of some features of SDS and the evolution of the phenotype over time [Rothbaum et al 2002, Dror et al 2011, Myers et al 2013a]:

Complete blood counts with white blood cell differential and platelet counts at least every three to six months, or more frequently if peripheral blood counts are changing or infections are recurrent and debilitating

Developmental assessment every six months from birth to age six years and growth every six months.

Assessment of nutritional status every six months and measurement of serum concentration of vitamins to evaluate effectiveness of or need for pancreatic enzyme therapy

Repeat bone marrow examinations every one to three years following the baseline examination, and more frequently if changes in bone marrow function or cellularity are observed.

Monitoring for orthopedic complications with x-rays of hips and knees during the most rapid growth stages

Bone densitometry before puberty, during puberty, and thereafter based on individual findings. Results must be interpreted in the context of stature and pubertal status.

Neuropsychological screening in children age 6-8 years, 11-13 years, and 15-17 years

Note: Discussions to update and maintain recommendations are ongoing.
