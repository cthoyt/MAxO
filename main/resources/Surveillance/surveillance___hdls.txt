Periodic clinical evaluation to monitor for the following is appropriate:

Changes in mobility, communication, and behavior, which could indicate a need to alter care and support systems (wheelchair/ personal assistance)

Onset of seizures and need for antiepileptic therapy

Contractures, which could indicate a need to change medical management and physical therapy

Behavioral changes, inappropriate emotions and actions, problems following directions, memory loss, incontinence, which indicate curtailing of independence

Difficulties in swallowing or weight loss, which trigger consideration for gastrostomy

Need for physical therapy to minimize contractures and maintain locomotion

Longitudinal MRI studies can potentially help with prognosis, as during the disease course the more rapid the confluence of patchy or focal T2 hyperintensities and the progression of cortical atrophy, the poorer the prognosis appears to be [Van Gerpen et al 2008, Sundal et al 2012c].
