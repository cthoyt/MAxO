Formal ophthalmic examination should be performed as soon as the diagnosis of DBS is considered. Frequent and serial monitoring is needed; the schedule should be determined by the findings present. Treatments (e.g., peripheral laser photocoagulation) may minimize the risk of retinal detachment resulting from high myopia.

Hearing evaluations should be performed as soon as the diagnosis of DBS is considered. Data on the natural history and possible progression of hearing loss are not currently available and thus no timetable for monitoring has been established.

Periodic monitoring of renal function seems prudent, based on the report of Shaheen et al [2010]. However the frequency of DBS-associated renal dysfunction is not currently known.
