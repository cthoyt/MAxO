Long-standing chronic inflammation of the pancreas is associated with an increased risk for pancreatic cancer. Persons with hereditary pancreatitis are at high risk because their onset of chronic pancreatitis is 20-30 years earlier than in sporadic forms of chronic pancreatitis.

Because surveillance for early evidence of colon cancer is effective, it is hypothesized that such surveillance may benefit individuals with hereditary pancreatitis age 40 years and older who have long-standing chronic pancreatitis and a strong family history of pancreatic cancer. Because long-standing chronic pancreatitis results in pancreatic scarring and fibrosis that make assessment of abnormalities difficult [Brand et al 2007, Ulrich 2001], it is recommended that concerned individuals be referred to a surveillance program that includes biomarker research and other new techniques.
