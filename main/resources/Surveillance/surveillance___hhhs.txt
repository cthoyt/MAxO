All surveillance of patients with HHH syndrome should be a combined effort of the general pediatrician or adult practitioner and a metabolic specialist.

Height, weight, and head circumference should be assessed routinely in children from the time of diagnosis to adolescence.

Plasma ammonia concentration, plasma and urine amino acid concentrations, urine organic acids, and urine orotic acid need to be monitored routinely, based on age and history of compliance and metabolic decompensation.

Low plasma concentrations of essential amino acids could trigger a catabolic state, requiring readjustment of the diet/formulas.

Low plasma concentrations of lysine may lead to delays in growth and development in infants.

Parents of infants and small children should be alert to subtle changes in mood, behavior, and eating and/or the onset of vomiting, which may suggest that plasma concentrations of glutamine and ammonia are increasing.

School performance should be monitored since poor school performance may lead to low self-esteem and/or behavioral problems that could influence compliance with a protein-restricted diet.

Periodic neurologic evaluation is warranted to monitor for neurologic deterioration even when metabolic control is optimal.
