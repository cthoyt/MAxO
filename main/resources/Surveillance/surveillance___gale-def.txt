The following are appropriate:

Monitor hemolysate gal-1P or urinary galactitol, especially if the diet is to be normalized. Acceptable levels of gal-1P in GALE deficiency are not known but are estimated from experience with classic galactosemia to be <3.5 mg/100 mL in red blood cells.

Follow growth.

Monitor developmental milestones; propose supportive intervention as needed.
