The following are appropriate:

ECG, measurement of blood pressure, echocardiogram, and carotid duplex scans annually or semi-annually to monitor for cardiovascular disease. Note: Children may experience severe carotid artery atherosclerotic blockage prior to any significant ECG changes.

Annually:

Neurologic assessment

MRI/MRA of head and neck to assess for vascular changes and silent strokes, which are true strokes that do not result in any clinical symptoms

Lipid profiles

Dental examination, x-ray, and cleaning

Hip x-rays to evaluate for avascular necrosis and progressing coxa valga

Dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and/or peripheral cutaneous computed tomography scan of spine, hips, and total body to assess bone density and body fat composition

Physical therapy and occupational therapy assessment for joint contractures and activities of daily living

Complete audiologic assessment with special attention to possible low-frequency conductive hearing loss

Complete ophthalmologic examination with special attention to possible exposure keratopathy
