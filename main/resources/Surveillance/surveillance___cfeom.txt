CFEOM is congenital and is believed to be non-progressive.

Surveillance is important for prevention of amblyopia, and to treat amblyopia and complications of corneal exposure [Yazdani & Traboulsi 2004].

Routine ophthalmologic care is indicated, with visits every three to four months during the first years of life, and annual or biannual examinations in affected individuals not at risk for amblyopia.

In individuals with specific TUBB3 variants, surveillance for endocrine abnormalities, facial or vocal cord weakness, and interventions for developmental delays are indicated.
