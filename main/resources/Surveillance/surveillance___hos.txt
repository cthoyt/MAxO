ECG is indicated annually or more often in individuals diagnosed with a conduction defect, as well as in individuals at risk for developing a conduction defect.

ECG should be combined with annual Holter monitor in individuals with known conduction disease to assess progression.

Depending on the nature and significance of potential septal defects, echocardiogram surveillance may be requested every one to five years by the managing cardiologist.
