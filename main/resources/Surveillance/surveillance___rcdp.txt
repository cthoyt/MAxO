Growth curves that allow weight comparisons to help determine the need for gastrostomy

The ages at which developmental milestones are achieved to provide realistic expectations

Recommendations for medical assessments including seizure control, vision, hearing, orthopedic care, and prevention of respiratory infections and contractures
