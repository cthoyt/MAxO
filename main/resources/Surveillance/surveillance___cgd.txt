Regular follow-up visits can aid in early detection and treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic infections and non-infectious complications such as colitis, pulmonary granulomas, and pulmonary fibrosis [Roesler et al 2005].

Laboratory examinations include CBC, chemistries, CRP, and ESR.

Significant rises in CRP or ESR should prompt evaluation for infection.

Presence of microcytic anemia and hypoalbuminemia may indicate development of colitis.

Monitor liver chemistries for transaminase and alkaline phosphatase elevation, especially drug-related hepatotoxicity.

Although imaging is also important in detection of infectious and non-infectious manifestations, no specific guidelines address the intervals at which imaging should be used. CT or MRI should be followed closely to monitor progression of disease or until resolution of infections.

Frequent follow-up visits also provide the treating clinician opportunities to encourage compliance with prophylaxis and educate the patient and family about the disease.
