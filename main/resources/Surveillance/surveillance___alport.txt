Clinical practice recommendations for the treatment and health surveillance of individuals with Alport syndrome have been published [Kashtan et al 2013].

Individuals with a diagnosis of Alport syndrome or thin basement membrane nephropathy should be followed by a nephrologist in addition to a primary care physician. Once overt proteinuria has developed, renal function should be assessed periodically by serum creatinine concentration or other estimates of glomerular filtration rate (e.g., creatinine clearance or serum cystatin C levels), and blood pressure should be monitored.

Although most females with XLAS exhibit only asymptomatic microhematuria, recent data indicate a significant risk for progression to ESRD [Jais et al 2003]. For this reason, all women with a diagnosis of Alport syndrome need to be monitored regularly for the development of proteinuria and hypertension.

Children with Alport syndrome should have audiologic evaluation every one to two years beginning at age six to seven years (see Hereditary Hearing Loss and Deafness Overview).

Periodic cardiac evaluation for aortic dilation for males with XLAS is appropriate.

Transplant recipients should be monitored for development of anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody-mediated glomerulonephritis.
