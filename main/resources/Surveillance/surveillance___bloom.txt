Families benefit from counseling regarding the risk of cancer in persons with BSyn. The wide variety of types and sites of cancer in Bsyn – plus the unusually early onset of solid tumors such as carcinomas and sarcomas – makes surveillance for cancer a life-long undertaking, requiring planning and cooperation among the affected person, the family, and the physician in charge.

In persons younger than age 20 years, leukemia is the main type of cancer. Until evidence becomes available that treatment at the earliest stages of leukemia is more effective than treatment after full-blown symptoms appear, hematologic surveillance other than that used in general pediatrics appears unnecessary, if not contraindicated.

Close contact between individuals age 20 years and older and their physicians is advisable, and symptoms that cannot be accounted for otherwise should be evaluated promptly as potential early indicators of cancer.

Screening for colon cancer, the most common solid tumor in individuals with BSyn (see Table 2), should begin decades earlier than in others, and should be carried out more frequently.

In adults, colon cancer screening may include colonoscopy every one to two years, and stool guaiac testing for blood every three to six months.
