Regular follow-up visits to the cardiologist every six to twelve months (depending on the severity of clinical manifestations) are required in order to monitor therapy efficacy. These visits should include the following:

Resting ECG

Exercise stress test, performed at the maximal age-predicted heart rate. For individuals on beta-blocker therapy (in whom maximal heart rate cannot be reached), the test should be performed at the highest tolerated workload.

Holter monitoring

Echo and MRI at least every two years

The limit for any allowed physical activity can be defined on the basis of exercise stress test done in the hospital setting; the use of commercially available heart rate monitoring devices for sports participation can be helpful in keeping the heart rate in a safe range during physical activity but should not be considered as an alternative to medical follow-up visits.
