For males with SGBS1:

Monitoring for hypoglycemia in the newborn period

Physical examination to monitor for scoliosis during period of rapid growth rate; radiographs as needed

If development appears to be normal on initial assessment, routine monitoring of social and intellectual development

Monitoring of renal function if renal anomalies are present

Physical examinations to monitor for tumor risk [Lapunzina 2005]:

Every three months until age four years

Every four months from age four to seven years

Biannually after age seven years

The following screening recommendations require further study to determine benefit. The clinician and family should discuss the methods to be used:

Wilms tumor. Abdominal ultrasound examination every three or four months from birth until at least age seven or eight years, and yearly thereafter [Choyke et al 1999, Lapunzina 2005]. Abdominal ultrasound examination should assess for both Wilms tumor and hepatic tumors.

Note: When associated with an overgrowth syndrome, the risk for Wilms tumor decreases after age eight years [Beckwith 1998].

Gonadoblastoma or hepatocellular carcinoma. Serial measurement of serum alpha fetoprotein and beta human chorionic gonadotropin concentrations with the following suggested frequency [Lapunzina 2005]:

Every four months until age four years

Every six months between ages four and seven years

Annually after age seven years

Neuroblastoma. Measurements of urinary catecholamine metabolites including vanillylmandelic acid and homovanillic acid as well as urinary free fractionated catecholamines with the following suggested frequency [Lapunzina 2005]:

Every four months until age four years

Every six months from age four to seven years

Annually after age seven years

Annual lifelong chest radiograms have also been suggested [Lapunzina 2005].
