It is advisable to follow porphyrin levels annually and resume phlebotomies (see Treatment of Manifestations) if porphyrin levels begin to rise in the presence of cutaneous signs. Note: Increase in urinary total porphyrins may also be caused by an increase in coproporphyrin (which is of no relevance with regard to the PCT); thus, when levels are only moderately increased, urinary porphyrin fractionation should be performed.

Because of reports of an association between diabetes mellitus and PCT [MuÃ±oz-Santos et al 2011], annual screening with a fasting glucose level is recommended, particularly in those with hypertension (BP >135/80 mm Hg).

Hepatocellular cancer (HCC) surveillance relies on a combination of serum AFP determinations and hepatic ultrasonography. No guidelines as to the frequency of these tests are currently available due to the rarity of PCT and even rarer occurrence of HCC. Surveillance is usually performed annually; however, in those with advanced chronic hepatitis C and/or alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatologists generally agree that surveillance for HCC should be at least every six months.
