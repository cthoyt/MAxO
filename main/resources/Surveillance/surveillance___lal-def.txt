No standard guidelines for the surveillance of individuals with LAL deficiency have been developed. The following screening practices can be considered to monitor for the most common symptoms associated with CESD.

Children

Special attention should be paid to growth and nutritional status. Chronic diarrhea or failure to thrive could indicate malabsorption.

Consider monitoring fasting lipid levels, platelet count, and liver enzymes every six months.

Adults with CESD should be evaluated every six to 12 months depending on disease severity.

Special attention should be paid to nutritional status. Chronic diarrhea or weight loss could indicate malabsorption.

Monitor routinely fasting lipid levels, platelet count, and liver enzymes.

Individuals with severe liver disease should be evaluated for esophageal varices by upper endoscopy every three years.

Individuals with hepatosplenomegaly should be monitored and treated for thrombocytopenia to prevent bleeding complications.

Both children and adults. Obtain serial liver and spleen imaging to monitor for hepatosplenic volume and to screen for hepatocellular carcinoma which has arisen in the setting of advanced cirrhosis [Riva et al 2008]. Consensus on optimal screening protocols has not been published.
