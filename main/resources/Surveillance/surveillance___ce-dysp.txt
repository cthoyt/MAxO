The following are appropriate:

Monitoring growth and development during infancy and childhood starting at the time of diagnosis

Beginning at age one year, examination of teeth with regular follow-up during to detect tooth damage and oligodontia

Periodic monitoring starting at the time of diagnosis for signs of nephronophthisis (renal insufficiency, renal cyst formation), including osmolarity testing in morning urine, urine collection assays to test for polyuria, measurement of blood pressure, determination of serum creatinine and blood urea concentrations to establish renal function, and periodic renal ultrasound examination to establish kidney size and presence of cysts. Periodic measurement of liver enzymes starting at the time of diagnosis.

Annual ophthalmologic examinations starting at age four years. Note: Electroretinography (ERG) and fundoscopy can be performed at an earlier age if it is evident that vision is reduced.

Evaluation for respiratory infection (with x-rays and sputum analysis) when clinical findings suggest pneumonia

In those with structural heart defects, periodic monitoring of cardiac function including auscultation, ECG, and echocardiography.
