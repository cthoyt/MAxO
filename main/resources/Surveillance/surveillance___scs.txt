Because increased intracranial pressure (ICP) can develop even after successful treatment of craniosynostosis, brain imaging or ophthalmologic evaluation for chronic papilledema should be obtained periodically until age 15 years, or at any time symptoms (e.g., headache, reduced school performance) are identified.

Examination for progression of facial asymmetry particularly in individuals with untreated unilateral coronal synostosis should continue until the completion of facial growth (age ~16 years).

Audiologic screening throughout childhood is indicated.

Regular ophthalmologic evaluations (frequency determined on the basis of symptoms) should begin before age two years or earlier if strabismus or severe ptosis is identified.

If cleft palate is present, monitor for ear infections and hearing loss.

Screen for sleep-disordered breathing at all visits.

At least annual assessment of developmental status of preschool-aged children is appropriate. If findings suggest developmental delay, comprehensive developmental assessment and referral to early intervention is indicated.
