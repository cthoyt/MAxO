Following a successful HSCT, the following should be routinely monitored:

Growth

Psychomotor development

Complete blood counts

Liver and renal function

Immune status

Donor and recipient chimerism

Development of post-transplant complications, particularly chronic graft-versus-host disease, decreased bone density, pulmonary and cardiac function, and gonadal function

Individuals with milder findings or those who have not undergone HSCT also need to be monitored for worsening of immune function with periodic assessment of clinical status and functional lymphocyte responsiveness.
