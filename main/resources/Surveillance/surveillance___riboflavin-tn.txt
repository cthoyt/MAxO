At three months and six months after initiation of riboflavin supplementation, recommended follow up is:

General examination

Neurologic examination

Discussion of any problems with riboflavin supplementation

Ideally, obtaining a blood sample for riboflavin/FAD/FMN, acylcarnitine analysis (if previous evaluation demonstrated abnormalities) to determine if these levels are normalizing

After one year of riboflavin supplementation, repeat examination/investigations as detailed in Evaluation Following Initial Diagnosis except for consultation with a medical geneticist/genetic counselor.
