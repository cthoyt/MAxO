There are no formal guidelines for surveillance for individuals with HFI (e.g., frequency of subspecialty visits with physicians and/or dieticians with expertise in management of inherited metabolic diseases).

Once the diagnosis of HFI has been made, periodic evaluation of liver function, renal function, and growth is reasonable, particularly if there are concerns regarding compliance with the fructose/sucrose/sorbitol-restricted diet.

While isoelectric focusing of transferrin and/or monitoring of aspartylglucosaminidase (elevated in untreated HFI) have been suggested as markers of disease control in HFI, neither of these clinically available tests has definitively proven utility in diagnosis or surveillance [Pronicka et al 2007, Michelakakis et al 2009, Quintana et al 2009].
