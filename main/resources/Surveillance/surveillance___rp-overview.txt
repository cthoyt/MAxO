Generally Goldmann visual field perimetry (GVF) or full-field static perimetry [Weleber et al 2015] and a full ophthalmoscopic examination with dilation are performed on an annual basis, with more frequent follow up for active complications such as cystoid macular edema.

Modeling of full-field static perimetry with generation of volumetric indices that reflect both the magnitude and extent of visual field sensitivity are used: for monitoring for rate of progression; as endpoints for clinical trials [Bainbridge et al 2015, Weleber et al 2016]; and to explain to patients the effect of disease progression on visual field [Weleber et al 2015].
