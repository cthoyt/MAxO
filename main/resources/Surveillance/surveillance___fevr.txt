Children who are at risk based on family history should undergo regular fundus examination to evaluate for the development of retinal neovascularization, traction, or exudate.

Asymptomatic individuals with a small region of peripheral avascularity may require annual review only. Those with active neovascularization or exudate may well require treatment and close observation thereafter.

Individuals with retinal traction require review at intervals depending on the degree of stability of the clinical findings. The frequency of the review varies by individual depending on the assessment of the examining clinician.
