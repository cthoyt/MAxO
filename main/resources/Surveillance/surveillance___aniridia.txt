Amblyopia and refractive error. Children younger than age eight years should be monitored every four to six months for refractive errors and detection and treatment of incipient or actual amblyopia (strabismic, refractive, or sensory). Glasses and other visual aids should be provided to be able to best access educational materials.

Detection of later-onset eye pathology. Individuals with aniridia should have an annual ophthalmology review to detect problems such as corneal changes and cataracts.

Glaucoma. Individuals with aniridia should undergo annual glaucoma screening throughout life including:

Measurement of intraocular pressure;

Optic disc examination;

Visual field assessment, when possible.

Note: Assessment of the optic disc and visual field may be difficult in the presence of media opacities and nystagmus.

Aniridic fibrosis syndrome. Individuals with aniridia with a history of multiple ocular procedures (penetrating keratoplasty, IOLs, and drainage tube insertion) should be monitored for aniridic fibrosis syndrome [Tsai et al 2005].

Wilms tumor. Children with aniridia and a WT1 deletion require renal ultrasound examinations every three months and follow-up by a pediatric oncologist until they reach age eight years. See Wilms Tumor Overview. (Those without deletion of the WT1 locus are at very low risk for Wilms tumor and do not require such screening [Gr√∏nskov et al 2001, Muto et al 2002].)

Renal function. Because of the increased risk for renal impairment in WAGR syndrome, it has been suggested that renal function be evaluated every few years across the lifetime in those with WAGR syndrome, especially those with bilateral Wilms tumor [Breslow et al 2005].

Hearing. Children with WAGR syndrome and isolated aniridia may have abnormal hearing despite a normal audiogram; thus, detailed audiologic evaluation is recommended [Bamiou et al 2007].
