Patients are typically followed most closely by a neurologist for medication management and for interval assessment of ambulation, speech, and swallowing. This is often done every three to six months, but may be annual for patients who are more stable.

Patients receiving dopaminergic drugs (for parkinsonism) are monitored for adverse neuropsychiatric effects; conversely, patients receiving typical or atypical dopamine antagonist agents (for psychiatric features) are monitored for the development or worsening of parkinsonism.

Annual ophthalmologic examination is recommended.
