The guidelines described below closely follow those presented in the consensus statement for standard care in spinal muscular atrophy [Wang et al 2007].

Individuals with XL-SMA should be followed regularly by a physician familiar with this condition (e.g., a clinical geneticist). Other subspecialists involved in ongoing care include the neurologist, pulmonologist, orthopedist, physical and occupational therapists, nutritionist, and gastroenterologist as needed.

Affected children should be followed at least monthly until the severity and disease course are more clearly delineated. Affected children frequently die in infancy or early childhood; their clinical status should be followed closely to optimize management, and so that the family has a good understanding of the progression and can make informed decisions.

The following are indicated on a routine basis:

Neurologic evaluations to assess muscle tone and help guide supportive management

Evaluation by a pulmonologist for evidence of progression of restrictive airway disease

Monitoring of caloric intake and weight, linear growth, head circumference, and growth velocity

Monitoring for scoliosis and kyphosis
