Clinical and laboratory examinations should be performed in individuals with nephropathic cystinosis according to disease severity and may include renal, endocrine, ophthalmologic, neurologic, and cardiac examinations [Kleta et al 2005]:

Evaluation by a nephrologist every three to six months depending on the severity of renal impairment

Renal function tests, electrolytes, and thyroid function tests at least every three to six months in those who are stable

Serum concentration of calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase and intact parathyroid hormone; plain bone radiographs as well as DEXA scans to detect osteopenia and bone fragility predisposing to fractures, starting as soon as diagnosis is made and continued throughout the course of the disease

Ophthalmologic evaluation with fundoscopic examination to screen for increased intracranial pressure every one to two years for those being treated appropriately

Fasting blood glucose concentration throughout the course of the disease and testosterone concentration (in males) every two to three years, starting before puberty

In advanced disease (i.e., poorly treated adults) and in late stages of disease, perform every two to three years:

Chest CT for detection of coronary and other vascular calcification

ECG

Brain CT or MRI for evaluation of cerebral atrophy or calcifications

Evaluation for the presence of progressive muscle weakness and swallowing difficulties using electromyography (EMG), oral sensorimotor examination, and modified barium swallowing studies with videofluoroscopy

Pulmonary function tests

Neurologic and neurocognitive evaluations including visual-motor integration, visual memory, planning, sustained attention, and motor speed beginning at age seven to eight years [Besouw et al 2010a]
