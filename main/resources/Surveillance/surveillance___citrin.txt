To monitor for emergence of the FTTDCD phenotype in persons with citrin deficiency older than age one year, close surveillance of anthropometric indices (e.g., height, weight, and head circumference; serum lipid levels including triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol) is appropriate.

It is recommended that the following be measured every several months:

Plasma ammonia concentration (especially in the evening or 2 hours after feeding)

Plasma citrulline concentration

Serum PSTI concentration

Increases in plasma citrulline concentration and serum PSTI suggest onset of CTLN2 [Tsuboi et al 2001, Mutoh et al 2008] and should prompt initiation of treatment.
