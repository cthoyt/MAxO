Gagnon et al [2010] provide guidelines for surveillance.

The following are appropriate:

Annual ECG to detect asymptomatic cardiac conduction defects. Some centers perform annual 24-hour Holter monitoring of individuals with DM1 who do not have cardiac symptoms [SÃ¡ et al 2007, Sovari et al 2007, Cudia et al 2009]. Tissue Doppler monitoring has also been proposed [Parisi et al 2007, Wahbi et al 2012].

Annual measurement of fasting serum glucose concentration and glycosylated hemoglobin concentration, with treatment for diabetes mellitus if indicated [Matsumura et al 2009]

Ophthalmologic examination every two years to evaluate for cataract formation

Attention to nutritional status including mastication and trouble eating [Motlagh et al 2005, Engvall et al 2009, Umemoto et al 2009]

Polysomnographic follow-up of sleep complaints [Kumar et al 2007]
