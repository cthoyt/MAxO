A multidisciplinary approach is required to effectively manage this pleiotropic condition. Suggested surveillance is summarized here:

Annual ophthalmologic evaluations with annual electroretinogram in those older than age five years

Routine (at least annual) measurement of blood pressure

A baseline renal ultrasound scan and annual renal function tests for all individuals with BBS. If a structural renal malformation is detected, review by a nephrologist and follow-up sonography is indicated.

Monitor BUN and serum concentration of creatinine if a progressive obstructive urinary tract anomaly is detected or if bilateral renal malformations are observed and satisfactory renal growth is not observed on follow-up ultrasonography.

In individuals with renal impairment (elevated serum creatinine) as a result of an underlying structural malformation, six-month to annual monitoring by a nephrologist for complications of chronic kidney disease is indicated.

Annual endocrinology review

Regular testing for diabetes mellitus by measurement of fasting glucose concentration or glucose tolerance testing

Annual thyroid function tests, liver function tests and lipid profile
