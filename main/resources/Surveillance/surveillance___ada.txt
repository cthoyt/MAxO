Annual or more frequent evaluation of lymphocyte counts, serum immunoglobulin levels, and various in vitro tests of cellular and humoral immune function (i.e., as listed above for the evaluation of individuals suspected of having SCID) should be performed following BMT/SCT and during ERT [Gaspar et al 2009].

Individuals on ERT also require periodic monitoring as follows:

Plasma levels of PEG-ADA activity

Erythrocyte dAXP concentration

Development of neutralizing antibodies, particularly if plasma ADA activity or clinical or immunologic status declines unexpectedly

Monitoring for the appearance or recurrence of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans
