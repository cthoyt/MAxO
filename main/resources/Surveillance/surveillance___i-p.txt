No schedule for eye examinations has been established, but the following has been suggested [Holmstr√∂m & Thoren 2000]:

Monthly until age three to four months

Every three months between ages four months and one year

Every six months between ages one and three years

Annually after age three years

Neurologic function should be assessed at routine visits with a pediatrician, pediatric neurologist, or developmental pediatrician.

Ongoing evaluation by a pedodontist or dentist is appropriate.
