Monitoring of the size of adult osteochondromas, in particular those involving the pelvis or scapula, may aid in early identification of malignant degeneration, but no cost/benefit analyses are available to support routine surveillance.

Radiography, CT scanning, MRI, positron emission tomography and technicium-99 radionuclide imaging can be used to evaluate centrally located osteochondromas, but it is not known whether the benefits outweigh the risks of irradiation and the potential for false positive results that lead to unnecessary interventions. In addition, optimal screening intervals have not been determined.

A single screening MRI of the spine in children with HMO has been recommended by some [Roach et al 2009] to identify spinal lesions that may cause pressure on the spinal cord. The presence of osteochondromas in the canal would then warrant close clinical follow up; encroaching lesions and those causing symptoms may merit excision.
