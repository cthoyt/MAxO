Persons with hemophilia who are followed at hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs) (see Resources) have lower mortality than those who are not [Soucie et al 2000, Pai et al 2016].

Young children with severe or moderate hemophilia A should be evaluated at an HTC (accompanied by their parents) every six to 12 months to review their history of bleeding episodes and adjust treatment plans as needed. Early signs and symptoms of possible bleeding episodes are reviewed. The assessment should also include a joint and muscle evaluation, an inhibitor screen, and a discussion of any other problems related to the individual's hemophilia and family and community support.

Screening for alloimmune inhibitors is indicated at least once during the first ten to 20 treatment days in children with severe hemophilia, and then every three to six months after treatment with factor VIII concentrates has been initiated either for bleeding or prophylaxis. After 50 to 100 exposure days, annual screening and screening prior to elective surgical procedures is sufficient. Testing for inhibitors should be performed in any individual with hemophilia whenever a suboptimal clinical response to treatment is suspected, regardless of disease severity.

Older children and adults with severe or moderate hemophilia A benefit from at least yearly contact with an HTC (see Resources) and periodic assessments to review bleeding episodes and treatment plans, evaluate joints and muscles, screen for an inhibitor, perform viral testing if indicated, provide education, and discuss other issues relevant to the individual's hemophilia.

Individuals with mild hemophilia A can benefit from an assessment at an HTC every one to two years. Affected individuals with comorbidities and other complications or treatment challenges may require more frequent visits.
