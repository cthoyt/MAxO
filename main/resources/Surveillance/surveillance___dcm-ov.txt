An asymptomatic person with a known pathogenic variant. Cardiovascular screening (physical examination, echocardiogram, and ECG) should be performed every one to three years.

An asymptomatic at-risk first-degree relative in a kindred with an established diagnosis of FDC in which the family pathogenic variant is unknown. Depending on age, cardiovascular screening (physical examination, echocardiogram, and ECG) is indicated every three to five years. If an at-risk first-degree relative has evidence of idiopathic or familial dilated cardiomyopathy, the surveillance recommendations outlined here should extend to that person's first-degree relatives.

An asymptomatic first-degree relative of an individual with IDC in whom it is unknown if the IDC is familial should undergo cardiovascular screening (physical examination, echocardiogram, and ECG) every three to five years starting in childhood. If a first-degree at-risk relative shows evidence of dilated cardiomyopathy, a diagnosis of FDC is made and the surveillance recommendations outlined here should extend to that person's first-degree relatives.

For at-risk relatives with abnormal evaluation results that do not meet criteria for DCM but could be consistent with early DCM (e.g., left ventricular enlargement but normal systolic function, decreased ejection fraction but normal-sized left ventricle, normal echocardiogram with ECG abnormality) [Burkett & Hershberger 2005, Hershberger et al 2010a, Hershberger & Siegfried 2011], full cardiovascular assessment to evaluate for acquired causes of disease (e.g., coronary artery disease with history of myocardial infarction or history of exposure to cardiotoxic medications) and subsequent yearly screening are indicated.
