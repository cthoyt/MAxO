Longitudinal follow up of persons with SCAD deficiency may be helpful in order to more clearly define the natural history over the life span, including annual visits to a metabolic clinic to assess growth and development as well as nutritional status (protein and iron stores, concentration of RBC or plasma essential fatty acids, and plasma carnitine concentration).

For individuals with a history of metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, and/or other acutely presenting symptoms, the need for closer follow up and surveillance should be determined by the physician.
