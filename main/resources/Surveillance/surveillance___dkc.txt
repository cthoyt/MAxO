The recommendations in this section were discussed at the first DC clinical research workshop in 2008 and updated in 2014 at a consensus conference that led to publication of the first edition of the Dyskeratosis Congenita and Telomere Biology Disorders: Diagnosis and Management Guidelines [Savage et al 2009, Savage & Cook 2015]. Because of the rarity of DC, the recommendations are not based on large-scale clinical trials.

Bone marrow failure

Consider repeating a complete blood count (CBC) once a year if CBCs are normal. CBCs should be obtained more frequently at the discretion of the treating hematologist.

Consider annual bone marrow aspirate and biopsy that includes morphologic examination and cytogenetic studies.

Individuals on androgen therapy for bone marrow failure

Check liver function tests prior to starting and then every three months.

Perform liver ultrasound examination semiannually for adenomas.

Check cholesterol and triglycerides prior to starting and every six months.

Cancer surveillance. Most solid tumors develop after the first decade (median age of onset: 28 years).

Monthly self-examination for oral, head, and neck cancer

Annual cancer screening by an otolaryngologist

Annual gynecologic examination

Annual skin cancer screening by a dermatologist

Pulmonary fibrosis. Perform annual pulmonary function tests starting either at diagnosis or at an age when the individual is able to appropriately perform the test (typically age ~8 years).

Oral and dental surveillance

Schedule routine screening and dental hygiene visits every six months.

Maintain good oral hygiene.

The individualâ€™s dentist should be made aware of the increased risk of head and neck squamous cell cancers and perform a thorough examination at each visit.

Oral leukoplakia should be monitored carefully and suspicious lesions should be biopsied.
