During the first year of life, infants may need to be evaluated as frequently as every week. No guidelines regarding the recommended type or frequency of laboratory testing have been published.

The following should be monitored on a regular six-month to one-year basis or more frequently if the patient is unstable and requires frequent changes in management:

Plasma amino acids

Plasma and urine MMA levels

Serum acylcarnitines and free and total carnitine levels

Chemistry: Na+, K+, CIâ€“, glucose, urea, creatinine, bicarbonate, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin (T/U), triglycerides, and cholesterol

Liver, kidney, and bone health

Bone marrow indices

Monitoring of kidney function periodically with creatinine, cystatin-C, and, if available, studies of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (e.g., iohexol plasma decay), in addition to imaging of the kidneys, will allow for early referral to nephrology and appropriate timing of renal transplantation when needed [van't Hoff et al 1999, Kruszka et al 2013]. Combined equations based on creatinine and cystatin-C are expected to reflect more accurately the kidney function in this patient population [Schwartz et al 2009].

Regular ophthalmology and audiology evaluations to screen for optic nerve thinning/pallor and hearing loss [Authors, unpublished observations] are recommended.
