Renal structure/function

Renal ultrasound examination to monitor for kidney cysts 12 months after establishing the diagnosis, then every two to three years in childhood/adolescence and every three to five years in adulthood. If an abnormality is detected, more frequent ultrasound examinations may be warranted.

Periodic monitoring of renal function; serum concentration of magnesium, potassium, uric acid; and possibly urine magnesium and creatinine, preferably under the guidance of a nephrologist. Annual or more frequent monitoring may be advised for patients who have laboratory findings suggesting renal impairment, are taking potentially nephrotoxic medications (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), or have structural renal abnormalities [Verbitsky et al 2015]
