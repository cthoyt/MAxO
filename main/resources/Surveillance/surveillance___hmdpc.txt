Close monitoring of liver function and disease markers such as hemoglobin, iron indices, and whole-blood manganese is required at three-month intervals.

Routine follow up with a neurologist and hepatologist should be provided with repeat assessment of MRI brain, and liver ultrasound and biopsy when clinically indicated (e.g., worsening of liver function) and for monitoring of treatment.

Adverse effects of chelation therapy with disodium calcium edetate include hypocalcemia, nephrotoxicity, trace metal and vitamin deficiency, and thrombocytopenia and leukopenia [Lamas et al 2012].

Complete blood count and renal function including urinalysis are assessed at baseline and monthly thereafter. Monitoring may be extended to every other month once on a stable dose. Additionally, the following need to be monitored: trace metal levels including manganese, zinc, copper, and selenium; liver function; electrolytes; calcium, magnesium, and phosphate concentrations; and iron status. Trace metal supplements are provided as needed.

Treatment may need to be discontinued if:

White blood count <3.5x10^9/L

Neutrophils <2.0x10^9/L

Platelets <150x10^9/L

>2+ proteinuria on >1 occasion (and no evidence of infection)

The above cut-off values are based on guidelines for D-penicillamine treatment [Chakravarty et al 2008]. Because chelation treatment with disodium calcium edetate may prevent mortality and morbidity in SLC39A14-related early-onset parkinsonism-dystonia, lower cut-off values may be acceptable. The clinical treatment benefit needs to be carefully weighed against occurring adverse effects for each affected individual.

Toxicity of iron supplementation. In order to avoid iron toxicity, serum iron and total iron binding capacity need to be monitored regularly. If serum iron exceeds 80% of total iron binding capacity, iron supplementation should be stopped or reduced.
