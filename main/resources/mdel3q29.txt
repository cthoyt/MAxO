Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis



To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with the 3q29 recurrent deletion, the following evaluations should be considered:

Comprehensive developmental assessment including evaluation of cognitive, speech and language, motor, and social skills

Psychiatric evaluation in individuals with evidence of neuropsychiatric manifestations including autism spectrum disorder (ASD)

Assessment for feeding problems and nutrition; consultation with pediatric feeding specialists as needed

Early consultation with a pediatric dentist

Evaluation in infancy for evidence of congenital heart disease

Consultation with a pediatric otolaryngologist as needed for recurrent otitis media

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Treatment of Manifestations



The following measures are appropriate:

Early speech and language therapy to address speech delays

Physical therapy as necessary to address fine and gross motor delays

Individualized education program (IEP) for school-age children

Care by a child psychiatrist for anxiety disorder and/or other neuropsychiatric manifestations

Applied behavioral analysis or other treatment for manifestations of ASD

Feeding therapy (including nutrition assessment) with a pediatric feeding specialist or behavioral pediatric psychologist; consideration of gastronomy tube for severe feeding problems and continued failure to thrive

Routine management of dental caries, congenital heart defects, and recurrent ear infections

Surveillance



Continued assessment of:

Feeding and nutrition

Developmental milestones

Cognitive development

Possible psychiatric manifestations

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk



Parents and older and younger at-risk sibs of a proband should be tested for the 3q29 recurrent deletion. Parents or sibs may have the deletion, but with only mild or nonexistent developmental delay or intellectual disability. The average age at onset for schizophrenia is 20-25 years; thus, mildly affected individuals remain at risk for neuropsychiatric manifestations and would benefit from monitoring and clinical evaluation.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
