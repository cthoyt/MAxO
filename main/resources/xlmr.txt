Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis



To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with alpha-thalassemia X-linked intellectual disability (ATRX) syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended:

Review of medical history for developmental progress and seizures

Assessment of growth in infants and children

Physical examination including assessment of facial features, muscle tone, and deep tendon reflexes

Assessment of cognitive and adaptive functions by neuropsychological testing

Auscultation of the heart for evidence of structural defect

Examination of the genitalia for cryptorchidism and other anomalies

Assessment of feeding in early childhood for swallowing difficulties, gastroesophageal reflux, and/ or recurrent vomiting

Ophthalmologic evaluation for strabismus, visual acuity problems, or structural eye defects if indicated by clinical assessment

Clinical genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations



The following treatments are recommended:

Calorie-dense formula and/or gavage feeding to compensate for poor nutritional intake

If food refusal is an issue, evaluation for gastrointestinal causes such as peptic ulcer disease

If drooling is a serious problem, treatment with anticholinergics, botulinum toxin type A injection of the salivary glands and/or surgical redirecting of the submandibular ducts

Treatment in the usual manner for gastroesophageal reflux, recurrent respiratory and urinary tract infections, seizures, severe behavior problems, anomalies (e.g., cleft palate, cardiac malformations, cryptorchidism, ambiguous genitalia, hypospadias)

Early intervention programs and special education for developmental delays

Prevention of Secondary Complications



Antibiotic prophylaxis and vaccination to prevent pneumococcal and meningococcal infection are reasonable precautions in the rare patient with asplenia [Leahy et al 2005].

Surveillance



Growth should be followed regularly in infancy and childhood and plotted on age-appropriate growth charts. (Syndrome-specific growth charts are not available.)

Developmental progress should be monitored throughout infancy and childhood.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk



See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Therapies Under Investigation



Search ClinicalTrials.gov for access to information on clinical studies for a wide range of diseases and conditions. Note: There may not be clinical trials for this disorder.

Anemia, if present, is mild and rarely requires treatment.
