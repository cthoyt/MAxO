Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis



To establish the extent of involvement in an individual diagnosed with Pendred syndrome (PDS)/DFNB4, the following evaluations are recommended:

Assessment of auditory acuity (ABR emission testing, pure tone audiometry)

Thin-cut CT of the temporal bones to identify structural abnormalities

Vestibular function studies

Thyroid ultrasonography and thyroid function tests (T3, T4, and TSH)

Medical genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations



The following are appropriate:

Hearing habilitation (hearing aids as early as possible)

Consideration of cochlear implantation in individuals with severe to profound deafness

Educational programs designed for individuals with hearing impairment

Treatment of abnormal thyroid function (if present) using thyroid hormone replacement therapy

Surveillance



Surveillance includes:

Semiannual or annual examination by a physician familiar with hereditary hearing impairment

Semiannual or annual examination by an endocrinologist familiar with PDS

Repeat audiometry initially every three to six months if hearing loss is progressive

Since goiter is more common than hypothyroidism, volumetric baseline measurement of the thyroid, obtained by ultrasonography with periodic (every 2-3 years) reassessment [Choi et al 2011b]

Agents/Circumstances to Avoid



Based on anecdotal reports that increased intracranial pressure in individuals with dilation of the vestibular aqueduct (DVA) can trigger a decline in hearing, some physicians recommend avoiding activities like weightlifting and contact sports.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk



At-risk relatives should be evaluated for hearing loss, vestibular dysfunction, and thyroid abnormality in the same manner as an affected individual at initial diagnosis.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing of sibs is indicated shortly after birth so that appropriate and early support and management can be provided to the child and family.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
