Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis



To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Floating-Harbor syndrome (FHS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Multidisciplinary developmental evaluation including assessment of gross and fine motor skills, speech/language, cognitive abilities, and vocational skills with special attention to speech delay and anomalies

Measurement of growth and plotting of growth parametersNote: Syndrome-specific charts are currently not available for children with a SRCAP pathogenic variant.

Ophthalmologic examination

Hearing evaluation (See Deafness and Hereditary Hearing Loss Overview for details of evaluation.)

Renal ultrasound examination and blood pressure assessment

Assessment for cryptorchidism in males

Orthopedic assessment of hip dysplasia and clavicular anomalies

Dental evaluation

Clinical genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations



Treatment includes the following:

Early intervention programs, special education, and vocational training to address developmental disabilities

Communication rehabilitation with sign languages or alternative means of communication

Behavior management strategies including referral to a behavioral specialist/psychologist and consideration of medication if needed

Referral of the family to support groups and other resources

Standard treatment for any of the following if identified:

Refractive errors and strabismus

Hearing loss

Seizures

Renal disease

Cryptorchidism

Orthopedic complications

Dental problems

Referral to an endocrinologist for consideration of human growth hormone (HGH) therapy. HGH therapy with modest response has been reported in three children with FHS. Caution is indicated as limited information about HGH therapy in FHS is available.

Investigation for celiac disease if indicated by clinical features

Surveillance



Surveillance includes the following:

Close monitoring of growth, especially in the first year of life

Annual:

Ophthalmologic evaluation

Audiologic screening; more frequent evaluation if there is a history of multiple episodes of otitis media

Blood pressure measurement and assessment of renal function

Standard monitoring for renal anomalies

Monitoring of bone age and for early puberty especially in cases of growth hormone use

Sonographic evaluation for renal cysts in teenage/adult years as indicated by abnormalities on the renal function tests and/or blood pressure measurement

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk



See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management



No specific pregnancy complications for the mother or the fetus have been observed in the two women with SRCAP pathogenic variants who had children with FHS.
