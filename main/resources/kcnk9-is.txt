Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis



To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with KCNK9 imprinting syndrome, the recommended evaluations following diagnosis (if not performed as part of the evaluation that led to diagnosis) are summarized in Table 3.


Table 3. 

Recommended Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis of KCNK9 Imprinting Syndrome




System
Evaluation
Comment





Oropharynx

Assessment by a cleft/craniofacial team if cleft palate, bifid uvula, or velopharyngeal insufficiency is present




Feeding

Feeding & swallowing evaluation
Consider gastrosotomy tube placement if clinically indicated by significant microretrognathia and/or recurrent aspiration



Pulmonary

Polysomnogram if obstructive apnea is suspected




Musculoskeletal

Evaluation for skeletal manifestations (i.e. joint contractures, scoliosis)
Consider referral to an orthopedist, if indicated



Neurological

Assessment of strength & motor skills



EEG if seizures are suspected



Spinal ultrasound of a pilonidal dimple or sinus to assess for filar cyst & lipoma in the sacral region




Endocrine

Assessment for hypoglycemia during neonatal period & infancy
If present, consider consultation w/an endocrinologist to discuss possible treatment w/diazoxide



Misc/Other

Developmental assessment



Consultation w/a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor



Recommended Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis of KCNK9 Imprinting Syndrome

Treatment of Manifestations



No specific management guidelines have been developed. Management is mostly supportive.

A multidisciplinary team of specialists in clinical genetics, plastic surgery, ophthalmology, pulmonology, gastroenterology, feeding, endocrinology, and neurology is recommended depending on the affected individual’s manifestations.

Treatment of Manifestations in Individuals with KCNK9 Imprinting Syndrome




Manifestation
Treatment
Considerations/Other




Lacrimal duct obstruction
Tear duct massage; consider lacrimal duct stent placement



Cleft palate, bifid uvula, or velopharyngeal insufficiency
Management by a cleft/craniofacial team; retrognathia & underdevelopment of the mandible may require mandibular distraction osteogenesis.



Obstructive sleep apnea
CPAP or BiPAP; ENT evaluation for tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy
Pulmonary consultation; consider treatment w/mefanamic or flufenamic acid (see Therapies Under Investigation)


Feeding difficulties or signs of aspiration
Use of a special nipple or bottle with cleft palate; short-term nasogastric feeding tube; consideration of gastrostomy tube



Gastroesophageal reflux disease
Standard positioning & pharmacologic treatment



Musculoskeletal findings (i.e., contractures, scoliosis)
Ankle-foot orthoses or other assistive devices; standard treatment for scoliosis
Physical therapy and/or occupational therapy evaluation; consultation w/an orthopedist


Seizure disorder
Evaluation of blood sugar & electrolytes; standard treatment for seizures
Consider EEG and referral to a neurologist


Unexplained hypoglycemia or suspected hyperinsulinism
Consideration of diazoxide therapy
Consider referral to an endocrinologist


Developmental delay
Early referral for developmental support/special education, which may include physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and/or cognitive therapy
Consider referral to a neurodevelopmental specialist and/or neuropsychiatric testing

Surveillance




Table 5. 

Recommended Surveillance for Individuals with KCNK9 Imprinting Syndrome




System
Evaluation
Frequency/Comment





Growth

Evaluation of nutritional status & growth
Every 6 months until age 2 years, then annually



Eyes

Ophthalmology evaluation to assess for evidence of decreased lacrimation & increased risk for corneal dryness
At least annually



ENT/Mouth

Evaluation of feeding difficulties
Every 6 months until age 2 years, then annually



Respiratory

Sleep study (if history of sleep disturbance)
Pulmonary evaluation every 6 months until age 2 years, then annually



Musculoskeletal

Evaluate for scoliosis
At least annually



Endocrine

Monitor serum glucose levels to monitor for hypoglycemia secondary to poor feeding & increased risk for hyperinsulinemia
Every 6 months until age 2 years

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk



See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Therapies Under Investigation



KCNK9, which is imprinted and expressed from the maternal allele with paternal silencing, encodes a member of the two pore-domain potassium channel (K2p9.1 or TASK3). The only KCNK9 pathogenic variant reported to date, p.Gly236Arg, reduces the outward current of the TASK3 channel by approximately 80% [Veale et al 2014].

Three members of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory fenamic acid class of drugs – flufenamic acid (FFA), niflumic acid (NFA) and mefanamic acid (MFA) – have been shown to stimulate two pore-domain potassium channels [Takahira et al 2005]. The reduced outward current through abnormal p.Arg236-containing TASK3 channels has been shown to be partially rescued by FFA, suggesting that fenamic acid compounds could be useful in treating this condition [Veale et al 2014].

Two affected individuals to date have been treated with oral MFA starting at age 14 months, with noted increased energy while on the medication and no adverse reactions. Clinical features are still present, and long-term studies are necessary to predict the outcome of individuals treated with MFA [Graham et al 2016].
