Competitive sports and other strenuous exercise are always contraindicated. All individuals showing exercise-induced arrhythmias should avoid physical activity, with the exception of light training for those individuals showing good suppression of arrhythmias on exercise stress testing while on therapy. It is important to note that efficacy needs to be periodically retested [Heidb√ºchel et al 2006]. The risk for arrhythmias during sports in individuals who have pathogenic variants in genes associated with CPVT but no clinical phenotype (no exercise-induced arrhythmias) is not known; thus it may be safest for these individuals to refrain from intense physical activities.

Digitalis favors the onset of cardiac arrhythmias due to delayed afterdepolarization (DAD) and triggered activity; therefore, digitalis should be avoided in all individuals with CPVT.
