Blood transfusions

Transfusions of red cells or platelets should be avoided or minimized for those who are candidates for HCT.

To minimize the chances of sensitization, family members must not act as blood donors if HCT is being considered.

All blood products should be leukodepleted and irradiated.

Radiation. It is prudent to minimize exposure to therapeutic radiation since data on radiation side effects are limited.

Androgens and growth factors. The combination of androgens and G-CSF was associated with splenic peliosis (“blood lakes”) and rupture in two individuals; thus, the combination should be avoided [Giri et al 2007].

Cancer prevention. Given the increased susceptibility of individuals with DC to developing leukemias and other malignancies, individuals with DC are advised to avoid toxic agents that have been implicated in tumorigenesis, including smoking.
