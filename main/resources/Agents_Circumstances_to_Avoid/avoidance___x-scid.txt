The following should be avoided:

Live vaccines. All immunizations should be deferred until after restoration of immunocompetence.

Transfusion of non-irradiated blood products. Only CMV-negative, irradiated (1500 to 5000 RADS) blood products should be used.

Breast-feeding and breast milk, until maternal CMV status is established by CMV DNA PCR testing of a blood sample. CMV is a chronic infection and intermittent viral shedding in various bodily fluids occurs unpredictably. If such testing is negative and the mother is CMV serology negative, breast milk may rarely be considered safe for feeding. Frequent retesting of breast milk is required given the risk of primary infection in the mother. Pasteurization of breast milk remains controversial in preparation for BMT given the severe negative consequences in BMT outcomes.

Exposure to young children, sick contacts, or individuals with cold sores
