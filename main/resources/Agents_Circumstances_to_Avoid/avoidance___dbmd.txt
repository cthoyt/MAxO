Individuals with DMD/BMD should avoid botulinum toxin injections.

Although it is recommended that triggering agents like succinylcholine and inhalational anesthetics be avoided in patients with DMD or BMD because of susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia or malignant hyperthermia-like reactions (rhabdomyolysis, cardiac complications, hyperkalemia), it should be noted that an extensive literature search did not find an increased risk of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility in people with DMD or BMD when compared with the general population [Gurnaney et al 2009].
