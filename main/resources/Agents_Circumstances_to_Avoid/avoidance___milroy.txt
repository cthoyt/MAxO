The following should be avoided:

Wounds to the swollen limbs, because of their reduced resistance to infection

Long periods of immobility with the legs in a dependent position (e.g., on a long airplane flight)

Medications, particularly calcium channel-blocking drugs, that can cause increased leg swelling in some individuals
