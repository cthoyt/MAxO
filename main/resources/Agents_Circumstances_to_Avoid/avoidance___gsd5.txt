Exercises that involve heavy static contractions or induce severe myalgia should be avoided [Quinlivan et al 2011, Lucia et al 2012].

Exercises that should be avoided in patients with GSDV [Lucia et al 2008] are the following:

Static muscle contractions (e.g., handgrip exercises)

Static muscle contractions or heavy loads on low muscle mass (e.g., weightlifting)

Dynamic exercises at a high-intensity level (e.g., competitive ball games)

Exercises with a high involvement of eccentric (lengthening) muscle contractions (e.g., jumps)

Very intense dynamic aerobic exercise (e.g., running, strenuous swimming, or cycling) except in individuals who are very fit and well habituated

General anesthetics. Risk of acute muscle damage is reported with certain general anesthetics (usually muscle relaxants and inhaled anesthetics), although in practice, problems appear to be rare. One report showed hyperthermia, pulmonary edema, and rhabdomyolysis [Lobato et al 1999]; however, GSDV does not appear to cause severe perioperative problems in routine anesthetic care. Nonetheless, measures for preventing muscle ischemia and rhabdomyolysis should be taken in individuals with GSDV [Bollig 2013].

Lipid-lowering drugs. A study in which 136 individuals with myopathy induced by one of the three lipid-lowering drugs atorvastatin, cerivastatin, and simvastatin were tested for the two more frequent PYGM pathogenic variants (p.Arg50Ter, p.Gly205Ser) revealed 20-fold more PYGM heterozygotes than expected for the general population [Vladutiu et al 2006]. These findings provide preliminary evidence that PYGM heterozygotes may be predisposed to statin-induced myopathy; however, because only two pathogenic variants were assessed, some individuals in this study who were presumed to be carriers could actually be compound heterozygotes. Thus, clinicians should be cautious when recommending statins to individuals who have GSDV or are carriers for a PYGM pathogenic variant.
