Avoid the following:

Medicinal iron

Mineral supplements

Excess vitamin C

Uncooked seafood (because of the risk of infection from microorganisms thriving under conditions of excess iron)

For those with hepatic involvement, alcohol intake should be restricted because it increases iron absorption and is toxic to the hepatocytes.
