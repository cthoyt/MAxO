There is some evidence that TP53 pathogenic variants confer an increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation [Hisada et al 1998, Varley 2003, Wang et al 2003, Cohen et al 2005]. Thus, individuals with germline TP53 pathogenic variants should avoid or minimize exposure to diagnostic and therapeutic radiation whenever possible [Varley 2003, Evans et al 2006]. Radiation-induced second malignancies have been reported among individuals with germline TP53 pathogenic variants [Hisada et al 1998, Limacher et al 2001, Cohen et al 2005]. Detailed studies to more formally assess this risk are in development.

Individuals with LFS are also encouraged to avoid or minimize exposures to known or suspected carcinogens, including sun exposure, tobacco use, occupational exposures, and excessive alcohol use, because the effects of carcinogenic exposures and germline TP53 pathogenic variants may be cumulative. For example, individuals with a germline TP53 pathogenic variant who smoke cigarettes have been shown to be at significantly increased risk of developing lung cancer than individuals with a germline TP53 pathogenic variant who do not smoke [Hwang et al 2003].
