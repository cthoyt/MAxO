Statins used to lower cholesterol may sometimes cause muscle pain and weakness.

Mathieu et al [1997] noted that “[n]umerous cases of perioperative complications in patients with DM have been reported. Hazards have been associated with the use of thiopentone, suxamethonium, neostigmine, and halothane. A retrospective study of perioperative complications was conducted for 219 patients who had their first surgery under general anesthesia at the Chicoutimi Hospital. The overall frequency of complications was 8.2% (18 of 219). Most complications (16 of 18) were pulmonary, including five patients with acute ventilatory failure necessitating ventilatory support, four patients with atelectasis, and three patients with pneumonia. Using multivariate analysis, [the authors] found that the risk of perioperative pulmonary complications (PPC) was significantly higher after an upper abdominal surgery and for patients with a severe muscular disability, as assessed by the presence of proximal limb weakness. The likelihood of PPC was not related to any specific anesthetic drug. Because of the increased risk of PPC, careful monitoring during the early postoperative period, protection of the upper airways, chest physiotherapy, and incentive spirometry are mandatory in all symptomatic patients with DM, particularly those with a severe muscular disability or those who have undergone an upper abdominal surgery.”

Veyckemans & Scholtes [2013] have reviewed appropriate anesthetic care for patients with DM1 and DM2.

Malignant hyperthermia during anesthesia including the use of vecuronium [Nishi et al 2004] has been reported in DM1 but is very uncommon [Kirzinger et al 2010]. (See Malignant Hyperthermia Susceptibility.)

Aggressive doxorunbicin-based chemotherapy for lymphoma in a person with DM1 produced sudden atrial fibrillations [Montella et al 2005].
