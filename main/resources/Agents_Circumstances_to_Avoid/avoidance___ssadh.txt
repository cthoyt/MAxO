Valproate is generally contraindicated as it may inhibit residual SSADH enzyme activity [Shinka et al 2003]. However, Vanadia et al [2013] reported an individual with SSADH deficiency who had refractory epilepsy after possible limbic encephalitis. The refractory epilepsy was finally controlled with magnesium valproate. One year after initiation of magnesium valproate therapy, the affected individual remained seizure free and had marked behavioral improvements, including decreases in aggression, coprolalia, and non-recognition of danger. In addition, the EEG demonstrated improved background organization.
