Carbamazepine (CZP) and phenytoin may increase seizure activity and myoclonus in NCL and result in clinical deterioration.

Lamotrigine may exacerbate seizures and myoclonus especially in CLN2 disease.

In a series of 60 individuals with JNCL, valproic acid (VPA) was withdrawn in 20% and clonazepam (CZP) in 16% because of side effects [Aberg et al 2000].

Fifty percent of individuals receiving VPA had sleep disturbances or excessive sedation.

CZP stimulates salivation and respiratory secretions, increasing the risk for pneumonia in bedridden individuals, many of whom have gastroesophageal reflux. CZP is a sedative and can cause behavior disturbances.
