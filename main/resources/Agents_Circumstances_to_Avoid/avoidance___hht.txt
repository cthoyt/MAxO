Individuals with significant epistaxis are advised to avoid vigorous nose blowing, lifting of heavy objects, straining during bowel movements, and finger manipulation in the nose. Some individuals with HHT experience increased epistaxis after drinking alcohol.

Most otolaryngologists with experience treating individuals with HHT advise against electric and chemical cautery and transcatheter embolotherapy for treatment of recurrent nosebleeds in most situations.

Anticoagulants including aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as ibuprofen that interfere with normal clotting should be avoided unless required for treatment of other medical conditions. In one study, lower dose agents, particularly anti-platelet agents, were not associated with hemorrhage in a high proportion of affected individuals. The findings support the use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents, with caution, if there is a very strong indication for their use [Devlin et al 2013].

Scuba diving should be avoided unless contrast echocardiography performed within the last five years was negative for evidence of a right to left shunt.

Liver biopsy should be avoided in individuals with HHT [Buscarini et al 2006].
