Avoid the following:

Valproic acid (commonly used for seizures and known to interfere with beta-oxidation) because it is considered to be a mitochondrial toxin with a theoretic risk of precipitating/exacerbating organ failure

Metformin (used to treat diabetes mellitus) because of the theoretic risk of exacerbating metabolic acidosis

Prolonged use of linezolid (an antibiotic used to treat S. aureus infections) because of the reported association with optic and peripheral neuropathy and lactic acidosis due to mitochondrial toxicity

Zidovudine (an antiretroviral nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase used to treat HIV) because of the reported risk of inducing mitochondrial disease by interfering with mtDNA replication

Dehydration and prolonged fasting, which can lead to clinical deterioration
