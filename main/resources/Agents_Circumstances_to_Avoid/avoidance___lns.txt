Probenecid and other uricosuric drugs designed to reduce the serum concentration of uric acid are contraindicated because they augment the delivery of uric acid into the urinary system and raise the risk for acute anuria from deposition of uric acid crystals in the renal collecting system.

Periods of relative dehydration are to be avoided because they could concentrate the purine metabolites in the urinary system and increase the risk for renal stones or urate nephropathy with resulting oliguria/anuria.
