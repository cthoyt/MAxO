Education for individuals with SCD involves learning how to control one's environment to minimize the chance of exacerbations. Environmental controls include avoiding the following:

Dehydration

Extremes of temperature (e.g., swimming in cold water, which can trigger a pain episode)

Physical exhaustion

Extremely high altitude without oxygen supplementation

Cocaine. While alcohol and illegal drugs are never endorsed, cocaine and its derivatives, with their vasoconstrictive and cardiac stimulation effects, are particularly dangerous drugs in the setting of SCD.

The analgesic meperidine, which should be avoided as first-line therapy because of potential CNS toxicity
