Although dopamine agonists are used as first-line treatment of dystonia in SLC6A3-related DTDS, bromocriptine and pergolide are generally avoided due to increased risk of pulmonary, retroperitoneal, and pericardial fibrosis.

Drugs with anti-dopaminergic side effects (e.g., some antihistamines, sedatives, and dimenhydrinate) may exacerbate the movement disorder.
