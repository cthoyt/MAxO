Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis



To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with myoclonus-dystonia (M-D) the following evaluations are recommended:

Clinical examination to evaluate the location, severity, and progression of dystonia and the severity and progression of myoclonus. This is best done by a neurologic specialist in movement disorders.

MRI

Clinical genetics consultation

Treatment of Manifestations



Medications may improve either the myoclonus or the dystonia or both:

Benzodiazepines, particularly clonazepam, improve mostly myoclonus and tremor [Kurlan et al 1988, Bressman & Greene 1990, Kyllerman et al 1990, Nygaard et al 1999, Goetz & Horn 2001].

Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), typically valproate but also topiramate, may improve myoclonus [Bressman & Greene 1990, Nygaard et al 1999].

Anticholinergic medication may improve dystonia [Bressman & Greene 1990, Goetz & Horn 2001] and botulinum toxin injection may be especially helpful for cervical dystonia [Bressman & Greene 2000, Goetz & Horn 2001, Berardelli & Curra 2002].

Improvement of dystonia with L-5-hydroxytryptophan [Scheidtmann et al 2000] and with L-dopa [Leuzzi et al 2002, Raymond et al 2008, Luciano et al 2009] has been reported.

One individual with M-D who represented a simplex case (i.e., a single occurrence of M-D in the family) showed a robust response to zolpidem [Park et al 2009].

Gamma-hydroxybutyrate [Priori et al 2000] and the sodium oxybate may improve myoclonus [Frucht et al 2005].

Note: Although the symptoms of M-D usually resolve with ingestion of alcohol, the risk of long-term addiction to alcohol renders it an unacceptable treatment option.

Surgery. Stereotactic thalamotomy can improve myoclonus, but caused dysarthria in one individual and mild hemiparesis in another [Gasser et al 1996]. In two others, myoclonus improved, but without significant gain in function [Suchowersky et al 2000].

Deep brain stimulation (DBS). In a recent study, ten persons with M-D (9 with an identifiable SGCE pathogenic variant) had DBS of the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) only (1 person), of the ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus (VIM) only, or of both GPi and VIM (8 persons). All experienced substantial improvement of both myoclonus (61.5%) and dystonia (48.2%). No adverse effects on cognition or affect were noted. VIM DBS was associated with a slightly higher incidence of reversible adverse events, possibly accounting for the slightly less robust improvement noted in those treated with VIM vs GPi DBS. The authors also note that quadruple VIM/GPi stimulation may be slightly more effective than VIM or GPi alone [Gruber et al 2010].

The results of case studies are summarized below:

Improvement of M-D was reported in a 63-year old with symptoms from age two years, suggesting that the findings are responsive to DBS, even after more than 50 years [Kurtis et al 2010].

Neurostimulation of the ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus (VIM) in an individual with medically intractable and progressive inherited M-D resulted in an 80% reduction of myoclonus score, but no significant effect on dystonia. A second individual who had genetically confirmed M-D had a 14% reduction of myoclonus score following VIM stimulation [Trottenberg et al 2001, Kuncel et al 2009].

DBS of the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) improved myoclonus and dystonia in two individuals [Cif et al 2004, Magari√±os-Ascone et al 2005], one of whom had a confirmed SGCE pathogenic variant [Cif et al 2004].

DBS of the medial globus pallidus improved both myoclonus and dystonia at an eight-week follow-up [Liu et al 2002].

Prevention of Secondary Complications



As self-treatment with alcohol is common, proper treatment and counseling regarding alcohol abuse may decrease alcohol-related toxicities, particularly in adolescents.
