To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with pachyonychia congenita, the following evaluations are recommended:

Thorough clinical examination to assess each affected area. These will vary based on the specific gene involved (see Table 2) and may need to be repeated once genetic testing is completed in order to fully understand the phenotype of the affected individual.

Medical history to determine what features actually are troubling the patient

Clinical genetics consultation
