To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with X-linked ocular albinism (XLOA), the following evaluations are recommended:

Medical history and physical examination, including a careful evaluation of pigmentation status at birth and later to distinguish between oculocutaneous and ocular albinism

A complete ophthalmologic evaluation

Dilated retinal examination of any at-risk possible carrier (mother, daughter) for the classic retinal carrier state

Dermatologic consultation for sun-protective lotion and sun-protective clothing and avoidance of associated cumulative solar damage

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
