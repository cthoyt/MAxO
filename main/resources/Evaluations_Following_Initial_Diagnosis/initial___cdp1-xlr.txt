To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata 1 (CDPX1), the following evaluations are recommended:

Full skeletal survey

Flexion, neutral, and extension lateral views of the C-spine in every patient. If clinical evidence suggests cervical myelopathy or if significant instability is demonstrated radiographically, a cervical MRI should be performed. Special consideration should be given to performing this study in flexion and extension positions as spinal cord compression may only occur with these movements (i.e., a normal neutral cervical MRI does not rule out dynamic compression).

Growth measures

Developmental assessment

Hearing assessment

Assessment of upper and lower airways if stridor is present

Polysomnography

Ophthalmologic evaluation

Cardiac ultrasound examination

Brain imaging studies

Genetics consultation
