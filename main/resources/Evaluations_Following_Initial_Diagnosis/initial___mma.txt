To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with isolated methylmalonic acidemia, the following evaluations are recommended:

A serum chemistry panel (Na+, K+, CIâ€“, glucose, urea, creatinine, bicarbonate, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin [T/U], triglycerides, and cholesterol); complete blood count with differential; arterial or venous blood gas; plasma ammonium and lactic acid concentration; formal urinalysis and ketone measurement; quantitative plasma amino acids; and urine organic acid analysis by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS)

If possible, measurement of plasma concentrations of methylmalonic acid, methylcitrate, free and total carnitine, and an acylcarnitine profile to document propionylcarnitine (C3 species) concentration

Measurement of serum vitamin B12 concentration to determine if a nutritional deficiency is present in the patient and possibly the mother (in newborns)

Biochemical genetics consultation
