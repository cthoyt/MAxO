To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with familial cerebral cavernous malformation (FCCM), the following evaluations are recommended:

MRI imaging of the brain and/or spinal cord if not already performed

Cerebral angiography may be considered to better define a complex lesion with arterial or venous components identified on brain MRI; however, caution should be used as cerebral angiography carries a small but appreciable risk of stroke.

In those with epilepsy:

Electoencephalogram (EEG) and/or video-EEG

Wada testing (to determine which hemisphere is language dominant)

Magnetoencephalography to confirm the localization of the epilepsy and to exclude other epileptogenic lesions

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
