To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with congenital cataracts, facial dysmorphism, and neuropathy (CCFDN) and to address the most disabling manifestations, the following evaluations are recommended:

Visual impairment (ophthalmologic examination)

Peripheral neuropathy and ensuing physical handicap (neurologic and orthopedic examinations, measurements of nerve conduction velocity)

Endocrinologic evaluation, related to growth delay, fertility problems, and osteopenia

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
