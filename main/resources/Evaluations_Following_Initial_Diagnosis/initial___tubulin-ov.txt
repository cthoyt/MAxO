To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with a tubulinopathy, the following are recommended:

Pediatric neurology consultation including interpretation of MRI to provide as much prognostic information as possible; EEG if episodic clinical events of uncertain cause or suggestive of epilepsy are present

Evaluations by a physical therapist, occupational therapist, speech therapist, and developmental specialist in infancy and the preschool years because of the high risk of gross and fine motor delays, delayed speech and language development, and intellectual disability

Assessment of special educational needs

In the context of gross and fine motor delays and multiple disabilities, evaluation of:

Growth, feeding, and nutrition

Respiratory status

Ophthalmologic evaluation

Nerve conduction study (NCS) if progressive neuropathy is suspected

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
