To establish the extent of disease and the needs of an individual diagnosed with giant axonal neuropathy (GAN), the following evaluations are recommended:

Assessment of development/cognitive abilities to establish the extent of disease and monitor progression or attempted intervention

Medical genetics consultation

The following investigations may be used to confirm clinically apparent problems but also to uncover subclinical involvement of PNS and CNS lesions which are not clinically apparent:

Clinical and electrophysiologic (sensory and motor NCVs, electromyography) examination of the peripheral motor and sensory nervous system (including assessment of the function of cranial nerves) to establish the extent of disease and monitor progression

Neuroophthalmologic examination to look for nystagmus resulting from cerebellar dysfunction or strabismus caused by involvement of cranial nerves III, IV, or VI

EEG, somatosensory and motor evoked potentials, and brain MRI to determine the degree of CNS involvement
