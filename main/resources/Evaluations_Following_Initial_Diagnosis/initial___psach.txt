To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with pseudoachondroplasia, the following evaluations are recommended:

Measurement of height and plotting growth on a disorder-specific growth chart

Evaluation by history and physical examination for skeletal manifestations, ligamentous laxity, and arthritis

“Genetic” skeletal survey including: AP views of the hips, knees, and hands, as well as lateral views of the knees and spine

Evaluation of the cervical vertebrae because of the potentially serious clinical complications associated with cervical spine instability [Shetty et al 2007], which can be assessed by flexion/extension radiographs or MRI, especially in persons with neurologic symptoms suggestive of cord compression.

Medical genetics consultation
