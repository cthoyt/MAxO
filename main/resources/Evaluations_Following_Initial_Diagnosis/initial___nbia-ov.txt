To establish the extent of the disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA), the following should be considered:

Neurologic examination for dystonia, spasticity, parkinsonism, and other neurologic findings, including evaluation of ambulation and speech.

Consider consultation with a movement disorders specialist

Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and/or speech therapy assessments

Thorough ophthalmologic examination (if not performed during the diagnostic evaluation)

Dietary assessment

Clinical genetics consultation

Note: The extent of disease in an affected individual is often well characterized during the diagnostic work up, which frequently includes neurophysiologic studies (EEG, EMG, electroretinogram, and/or visual evoked potentials) and brain MRI.
