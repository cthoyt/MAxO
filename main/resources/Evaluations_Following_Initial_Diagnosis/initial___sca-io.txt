To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with infantile-onset spinocerebellar ataxia (IOSCA), the following are recommended:

Neurologic examination to evaluate the grade of ataxia and neuropathy

Audiologic examination to evaluate the grade of hearing deficit and need for hearing aids

Ophthalmologic examination to evaluate the grade of ophthalmoparesis and optic atrophy

Neurophysiologic examinations

ENMG (electroneuromyography)

SEP (somatosensory evoked potentials). Note: Changes in SEP occur early in the disease course and correlate with sensory system involvement.

VEP (visual evoked potentials)

Neuroimaging. Brain MRI

Other. Clinical genetics consultation
