To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), the following evaluations are recommended if specific symptoms are present:

MRI of the brain and spinal cord if there are cognitive problems or unusually severe ataxia, motor, or sensory findings

Speech and swallowing assessment if dysarthria and/or dysphagia are present

Gait assessment

EMG/NCV if peripheral symptoms are present to assess the degree of involvement of the peripheral nervous system

Clinical genetics consultation
