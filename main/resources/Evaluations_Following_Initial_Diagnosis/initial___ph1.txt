To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1), the following evaluations are recommended based on the guidelines and suggestions of Hoppe & Langman [2003], two recent reviews by the European Hyperoxaluria Consortium, OxalEurope [Cochat et al 2012] (see Table 4), and a recent review by Hoppe [2012].

The following are recommended in all cases:

Molecular genetic testing to determine the AGXT genotype if not already performed

Clinical genetics consultation

The further extent of the initial evaluation of patients with PH1 should depend on their baseline renal function at the time of diagnosis and the evaluations performed as part of the diagnostic work up.

For those with preserved renal function (i.e., measured or estimated GFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m2):

Renal ultrasound examination and fundoscopic eye examination to identify the presence/extent of oxalate deposition

Baseline urinalysis (spot and 24 hour collection)

For those with a GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. In addition to the above evaluations: measurement of plasma oxalate

For those with a GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or in whom there is a rapid deterioration in function. In addition to the above evaluations:

Bone x-rays to evaluate for radiodense metaphyseal bands and diffuse demineralization, potentially bone marrow examination may also be required

Thyroid function testing

Electrocardiogram to evaluate for an associated atrioventricular block

Ultrasound and/or CT scan of the heart and viscera allows evaluation of calcification in such organs

Hemoglobin to evaluate for anemia associated with either renal dysfunction or marrow deposition of oxalate

History and physical examination to assess the risk of arterial insufficiency or ischemia based on vessel wall deposition
