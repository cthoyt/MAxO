EMG and nerve conduction velocity in order to evaluate for peripheral neuropathy

Cardiologic evaluation including EKG and echocardiogram

Laboratory investigations of lipids including measurement of plasma cholestanol level (if not performed as part of the diagnostic evaluation)

Evaluation for osteoporosis

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
