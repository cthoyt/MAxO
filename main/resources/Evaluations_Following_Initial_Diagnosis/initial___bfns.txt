KCNQ2-related disorders represent a broad prognostic spectrum, and evaluation following a positive KCNQ2 genetic test differs depending on severity of the phenotype.

Individuals with benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE)

In-depth neurologic examination

Developmental evaluation

Individuals with neonatal epileptic encephalopathy (NEE)

Video EEG monitoring including sleep phase to obtain information on presence of seizures. A burst suppression EEG pattern might only be seen during sleep.

Cognitive and behavioral neuropsychological testing

Assessment of digestive and other non-neurologic comorbidities

All individuals with a KCNQ2-related disorder. Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor is also recommended.
