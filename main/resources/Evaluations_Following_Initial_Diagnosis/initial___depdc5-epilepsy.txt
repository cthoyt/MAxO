To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with DEPDC5-related epilepsy, the following evaluations are recommended:

Detailed clinical history to establish seizure type and frequency

Routine EEG

High-resolution brain MRI to evaluate for focal cortical dysplasia or other cortical malformation

Cognitive and behavioral assessment when problems are suspected based on focused medical history

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
