Peripheral blood count and bone marrow analysis for evidence of megaloblastic anemia

Serum folate concentration, serum vitamin B12 concentration, and serum iron studies to exclude other entities

Hearing test

Fasting serum glucose concentration, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and urinalysis to diagnose diabetes mellitus

Ophthalmologic evaluation

Cardiac evaluation, including echocardiography

Neuroimaging including brain MRI when clinically indicated

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
