To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Roberts syndrome (RBS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Radiographic documentation of the craniofacial, limb, and hand anomalies

Orofacial and limb malformation assessment to determine the need for management and plastic surgery

Ophthalmologic evaluation

Echocardiogram or evaluation by cardiologist to assess for structural heart defects

Ultrasound evaluation of the kidneys for cysts

Multidisciplinary evaluation including psychological assessment and formal, age-appropriate developmental assessment

Clinical genetics consultation

Note: No published guidelines to evaluate the clinical manifestations contributing to morbidity and mortality exist. The recommendations given are based on the literature and the experience of clinical geneticists.
