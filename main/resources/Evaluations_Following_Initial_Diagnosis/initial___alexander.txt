To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Alexander disease, the following evaluations are recommended:

Complete neurologic assessment

Formal, age-appropriate developmental assessment

Assessment of feeding/eating, digestive problems (including constipation and gastroesophageal reflux), and nutrition using history, growth measurements, and, if needed, gastrointestinal investigations

Video/EEG monitoring to obtain definitive information about the occurrence of seizures and the need for antiepileptic drugs

Psychological assessment for older patients to determine their awareness and understanding of the disease and its consequences

Examination for possible scoliosis

Assessment of family and social structure to determine availability of adequate support system

Clinical genetics consultation
