To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with a TRPV4-associated neuromuscular disorder, the following evaluations are recommended:

Physical/neurologic examination to determine extent of weakness and atrophy, pes cavus, gait stability, and sensory loss

Electromyography (EMG) with nerve conduction velocity (NCV)

ENT consultation with laryngoscopy, as needed to document the status of the vocal folds

Pulmonary function testing and dynamic breathing chest x-ray

Hearing assessment (See Deafness and Hereditary Hearing Loss Overview for different types of hearing assessment.)

Skeletal x-rays to document any associated skeletal dysplasia

Clinical genetics/genetic counseling consultation

To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with a TRPV4-associated skeletal dysplasia, the following evaluations are recommended:

Skeletal radiographs to document involvement of the long bones and spine, which can help determine patient needs as well as provide a baseline for comparison with future studies

Flexion/extension cervical spine films to determine if there is atlanto-axial instability secondary to odontoid hypoplasia

Pulmonary function tests and/or sleep study if the thorax is particularly narrow and/or kyphoscoliosis is progressive

Hearing assessment (See Deafness and Hereditary Hearing Loss Overview for different types of hearing assessment.)
