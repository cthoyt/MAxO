To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Unverricht-Lundborg disease (EPM1), the following evaluations are recommended:

Clinical evaluation including walking, coordination, handwriting, school performance, and emotional features

Examination of myoclonus including evaluation of myoclonus at rest, with action, and in response to stimuli

EEG evaluation before initiation of therapy, as it is most characteristic before use of anticonvulsive medication

Clinical genetics consultation
