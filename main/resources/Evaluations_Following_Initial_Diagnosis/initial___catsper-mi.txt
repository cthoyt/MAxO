To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with CATSPER-related male infertility, the following evaluations are recommended (if not performed previously as part of the diagnostic evaluation):

In males, pubertal age or older, semen analysis to assess sperm number, motility, and morphology

In males and females with DIS, hearing evaluation including otologic examination and audiologic assessment (including measurement of bone conduction)

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
