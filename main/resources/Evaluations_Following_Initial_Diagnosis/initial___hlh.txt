To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), as well as to determine the appropriate therapy, the following evaluations are recommended:

Physical examination to evaluate for rashes, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and neurologic dysfunction

Evaluation of blood and bone marrow compartments (CBC and BM biopsy)

Determination of the extent of liver involvement by measuring serum concentration of transaminases, bilirubin, triglycerides, sodium, and lactate dehydrogenase

Identification of potential infectious co-factors, especially viral infection or reactivation, which would require specific treatment

Establishing the presence or extent of CNS involvement by evaluating the CSF and performing neuroimaging and neuropsychological assessment

Testing of NK cell activity, intracellular perforin and granzyme B expression, and CD107a mobilization if these tests are available

Evaluation of inflammatory factors such as serum concentrations of ferritin, sIL2RÎ±, and other cytokines

Evaluation and monitoring of PT, PTT, and fibrinogen

Clinical genetics consultation

Molecular genetic testing, if not performed previously, which may help to determine if an affected individual is a candidate for bone marrow transplantation:

Genetic testing for PRF1, UNC13D, STX11, and STXBP2 pathogenic variants

Consideration of testing for RAB27A pathogenic variants in any individual with HLH, even with no obvious evidence of depigmentation

Consideration of testing for XIAP (formerly BIRC4) and SH2D1A pathogenic variants in any male with HLH

Collection of materials for future characterization of underlying genetic defects, most significantly in individuals with terminal disease
