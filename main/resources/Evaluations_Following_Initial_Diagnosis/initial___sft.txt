To establish the extent of disease in a person diagnosed with sialuria, the following evaluations are recommended, if they have not already been completed. Note: The priority of these recommendations depends on the signs observed in the patient and/or noted by the parents:

CBC with differential to evaluate for microcytic anemia

Measurement of serum bilirubin concentration to evaluate for jaundice

Skeletal survey to evaluate for dysostosis multiplex

Developmental and neurologic assessment

EEG when relevant

Neuroimaging with the purpose of differentiating sialuria from neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorders
