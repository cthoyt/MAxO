To assess the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC), the following evaluations are recommended:

Serum and urine concentrations of electrolytes

Assessment of renal function, including measurement of serum BUN and creatinine

Serum concentration of glucose, cortisol and ACTH

Assessment of arterial blood gases in those who are unwell

Measurement of aldosterone and plasma renin activity

Note: Typically, affected individuals who are in shock have hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, acidosis, very elevated serum concentration of ACTH, and increased urinary excretion of sodium. Some samples may need careful handling (e.g., ACTH) and results may only be available some days later. Therefore, it is important to document the childâ€™s clinical condition at the time of sample collection, the source of the sample (e.g., venous, arterial), and the quality of the sample (e.g., hemolyzed) to help with future interpretation of the results.
