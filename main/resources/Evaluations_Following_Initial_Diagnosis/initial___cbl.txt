To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with a disorder of intracellular cobalamin metabolism, the following evaluations are recommended.

In an unstable patient:

Serial metabolic evaluations of blood gases, electrolytes, glucose, ammonia, liver function, total and direct bilirubin, renal function, lactate dehydrogenase, plasma amino acids (methionine), plasma methylmalonic acid (MMA), and total plasma homocysteine (tHcy) to guide acute management until the patient stabilizes

Complete blood count (CBC) with differential to evaluate for megaloblastic anemia, cytopenias

Peripheral blood smear to evaluate for the presence of schistocytes, in the presence of other manifestations of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)

Molecular genetic testing to identify pathogenic variants, if not previously performed, to aid in genetic counseling and prediction of disease severity

Once the patient becomes stable:

Clinical assessment of growth parameters, head circumference, ability to feed, developmental status, and neurologic status

Laboratory assessment of nutritional status (electrolytes, albumin, prealbumin, plasma amino acids, vitamin levels [including thiamine and 25-hydroxyvitamin D], and trace minerals) and renal function; complete blood count to monitor for cytopenias

Echocardiogram

EEG and brain MRI in symptomatic individuals

Ophthalmologic examination
