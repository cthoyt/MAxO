To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS), the following evaluations are recommended if not already completed:

History for abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, constipation, diarrhea, or change in stool size, shape, and/or color

Complete blood count (CBC), colonoscopy, and upper endoscopy in the mid-teens (age 15 years) or at the time of initial symptoms, whichever is earlier

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

All individuals with an SMAD4 pathogenic variant should be evaluated for complications related to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)
