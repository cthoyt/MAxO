To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with deafness and myopia (DFNMYP) syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended if they have not already been completed:

Audiology evaluation for sensorineural hearing loss and auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder

Ophthalmology evaluation for myopia and other ocular comorbidities

Evaluation by early intervention/educational programs for the hearing impaired including baseline speech and language assessment in children

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
