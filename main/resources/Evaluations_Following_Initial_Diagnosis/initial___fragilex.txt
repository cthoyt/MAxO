Fragile X syndrome. To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with fragile X syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended:

Complete developmental and educational assessments (including speech and language evaluation and occupational/physical therapy evaluation) for educational planning

Behavioral and psychological assessment to determine the presence of concentration/attention problems, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, aggression, and depression

In infants, feeding assessment (including attention to possible gastroesophageal reflux)

Physical examination to evaluate for hypotonia and/or connective tissue findings, primarily joint hyperextensibility and pes planus

Cardiac auscultation for mitral valve prolapse. If indicated by a murmur or click, consider echocardiography (usually in adulthood).

Assessment for hypertension

History for possible seizure activity

Ophthalmologic evaluation for possible strabismus

In young children, history and physical examination for evidence of recurrent otitis media

FXTAS. To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with FXTAS, the following are recommended:

Neurologic examination

Behavioral and psychological assessment

Neuroradiologic evaluation

POI. To establish the extent of disease in a woman diagnosed with POI, gynecologic evaluation including hormonal and/or ultrasonographic assessment is appropriate.

Note: The diagnosis of POI does not eliminate the possibility of subsequent conception. A premutation carrier woman had a child with fragile X syndrome after being diagnosed with POI [Corrigan et al 2005, Nelson et al 2005]. It is estimated that 5%-10% of women with POI may conceive after the diagnosis [Nelson et al 2005].
