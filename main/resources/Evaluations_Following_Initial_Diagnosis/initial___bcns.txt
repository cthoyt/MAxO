To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Baseline measurement of head circumference, preferably with plotting on a chart that accounts for height. Evidence of rapid increase in centiles should prompt further investigation to exclude hydrocephalus.

Physical examination for birth defects of clinical significance (e.g., orofacial clefts, polydactyly)

X-rays to evaluate for rib and vertebral anomalies and falx calcification

Ophthalmologic evaluation for evidence of strabismus, cataract, orbital cyst, microphthalmia, and pigmentary changes of the retinal epithelium

Evaluation by a dentist or orthodontist familiar with NBCCS; jaw x-ray (orthopantogram) in individuals age eight years or older to evaluate for jaw keratocysts and other anomalies

Skin examination by a dermatologist familiar with NBCCS

Ultrasound examination of the ovaries to evaluate for ovarian fibromas prior to pregnancy

Echocardiography in the first year of life to evaluate for cardiac fibromas

Clinical genetics consultation

Because mesenteric and pleural cysts are rare, evaluation is not necessary in the absence of symptoms.
