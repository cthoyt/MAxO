To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with autosomal recessive spondylocostal dysostosis (AR SCDO), the following are recommended:

Assessment of respiratory function, especially if tachypnea and/or feeding difficulties suggest the possibility of respiratory insufficiency

Evaluation for other (e.g., renal and cardiac) anomalies

Evaluation of a male child for the presence of inguinal hernia

Clinical genetics consultation
