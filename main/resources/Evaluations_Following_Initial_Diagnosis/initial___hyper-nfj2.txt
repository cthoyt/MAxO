To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with ADTKD-REN, the following evaluations are recommended:

Hemoglobin concentration to document the level of anemia

Serum uric acid concentration to identify persons at risk for gout

A 24-hour urine collection to quantify urine output and determine if polyuria is present (although this can usually determined by history). Clinical questioning regarding enuresis (bed-wetting) or frequent thirst or urination will help establish a diagnosis of polyuria.

A standard basic metabolic panel to determine if hyperkalemia is present

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
