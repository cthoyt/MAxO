To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with PA the following evaluations are recommended (see Figure 2):

Blood gas with base balance, electrolytes with anion gap, glucose, plasma ammonia, calcium, phosphorus, urine ketones

Plasma amino acids, total and free carnitine and acylcarnitine profile, and urine organic acid analysis

Complete blood count to evaluate for cytopenias

Consider initiating an evaluation for sepsis if the CBC and individualâ€™s clinical signs suggest that infection is likely

Amylase and lipase to evaluate for pancreatitis

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Once the patient becomes stable, evaluations include the following:

Clinical assessment of growth parameters, ability to feed, the need for G-tube placement, and neurologic status.

Laboratory assessment of nutritional status (calcium, phosphorus, albumin, prealbumin, plasma amino acids, vitamin levels [including thiamine and 25-hydroxyvitamin D], iron panel, and minerals and renal function); complete blood count to monitor for cytopenias

Clinical evaluation for cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia with ECG, 24-hour Holter monitor, echocardiogram

EEG and brain MRI in symptomatic individuals

Developmental evaluation

Dilated eye examination

Hearing evaluation

Immunology consult

Other

Complete adherence to regional immunization schedules and influenza vaccination is indicated [Baumgartner et al 2014].

Maintain a high index of suspicion for endocrine, immune, and renal problems and address accordingly.
