Neurologic consultation with attention to ataxia, including assessment of extraocular movement

Assessment of speech re communication and swallowing re risk of aspiration

Nutrition and feeding assessment

Immune status of specific parameters that were previously aberrant (e.g., immunoglobulin levels, B/T cell levels, T cell function)

Chest x-ray and pulmonary function for baseline

CBC with differential

Diabetes screen (urinalysis, fasting blood glucose concentration, Hgb A1C)

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
