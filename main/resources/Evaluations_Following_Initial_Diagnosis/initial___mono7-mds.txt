Urgent referral to an oncologist for evaluation of cytopenias and bone marrow abnormalities that appear prior to the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is indicated. Laboratory studies for hematologic status and hemoglobin F levels, as well as cytogenetic studies in unstimulated peripheral blood are recommended.

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor is recommended.
