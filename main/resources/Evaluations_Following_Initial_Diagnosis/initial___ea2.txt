To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2), the following evaluations are recommended:

Neurologic examination for signs of interictal ataxia and nystagmus

Neuroimaging of the head (if not performed already), preferably MRI, to evaluate for structural lesions and to look for evidence of atrophy

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
