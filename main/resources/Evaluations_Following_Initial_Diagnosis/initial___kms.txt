To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with IGD, the following evaluations are recommended:

Assessment of clinical manifestations of hypogonadism based on the age and sex of the individual, if not already performed as part of the diagnostic work up (see Diagnosis and Table 1)

Assessment of laboratory findings* of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism if not already performed as part of the diagnostic work up

* Serum concentration of LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) and in males total testosterone (T) <100 ng/dL and in females estradiol (E2) <50 pg/mL

Assessment for presence of possible non-reproductive features including: renal ultrasound examination (to detect unilateral renal agenesis), hearing tests (to detect sensorineural hearing loss), skeletal survey (to detect limb/spine bony abnormalities), dental exam (to detect dental agenesis), eye exam (to detect iris and/or chorioretinal coloboma) and developmental assessment (if there is evidence of developmental delay)

In addition to assessing the degree of hypogonadism/GnRH deficiency, potential deterioration in bone health that may have resulted from periods of low-circulating sex hormones needs to be addressed. Depending on the timing of puberty, duration of GnRH deficiency, and other osteoporotic risk factors (e.g., glucocorticoid excess, smoking), one should consider obtaining a bone mineral density study (see Prevention of Secondary Complications).

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
