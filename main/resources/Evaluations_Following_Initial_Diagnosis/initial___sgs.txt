To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Radiographs to detect skeletal manifestations that may require attention by an orthopedist (e.g. severe scoliosis, C1/C2 abnormality)

Brain MRI

Echocardiogram

MRA or CT scan with 3D reconstruction from head to pelvis to identify arterial aneurysms and arterial tortuosity throughout the arterial tree should be considered [Carmignac et al 2012]

Surgical evaluation for hernia repair, if indicated

Developmental assessment

Ophthalmology examination by an ophthalmologist with expertise in connective tissue disorders

Clinical genetics consultation
