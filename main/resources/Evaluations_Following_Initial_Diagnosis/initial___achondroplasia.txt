Clinical manifestations in achondroplasia vary modestly. In order to establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with achondroplasia, the following evaluations are recommended:

Clinical genetics consultation and, if feasible, consultation with a clinician experienced in caring for children with bone dysplasias

Documentation of length, weight, and head circumference compared with achondroplasia-specific growth standards

Assessment of the craniocervical junction including neurologic history and examination, computerized tomography of the craniocervical junction, and polysomnography

Baseline computerized tomography of the brain
