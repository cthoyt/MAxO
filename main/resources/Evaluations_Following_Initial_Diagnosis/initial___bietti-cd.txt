To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with Bietti crystalline dystrophy (BCD), the following evaluations are recommended:

Fundoscopic examination

Full-field electroretinogram (ffERG) to establish a baseline

Visual field testing (perimetry) to evaluate the degree of visual field constriction or presence of scotomas and to establish a baseline

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) to evaluate for complications such as choroidal neovascularization (CNV) or macular hole formation

Medical genetics consultation
