To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with the Kleefstra syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended following the initial diagnosis:

Complete review of systems

Physical and neurologic examination

Renal ultrasound examination to evaluate for possible renal/urologic anomalies

Echocardiogram and ECG to evaluate for possible structural cardiac anomalies and atrial rhythm defects; follow-up depending on the severity of any cardiac anomaly identified

Speech/language evaluation including audiologic examination

Assessment for signs and symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux (GER)

Physical and/or occupational therapy assessment

Sleep history

EEG if seizures are suspected

Neuroimaging (MRI) especially in the presence of findings such as seizures and/or movement disorder, extreme apathy/catatonia, and/or regression in psychomotor development

Clinical genetics consultation
