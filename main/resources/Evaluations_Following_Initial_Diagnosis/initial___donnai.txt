To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with Donnai-Barrow syndrome (DBS), the following studies are recommended:

Neuroimaging (preferably MRI scan)

Detailed ophthalmologic examination including glaucoma screening

Audiologic evaluation

Quantitative urine protein determination

Serum tests of renal function including blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine concentrations

Determination of circulating levels of vitamin A, vitamin D, and other regulators of calcium status

EEG if symptoms suggest a seizure disorder

Clinical genetics consultation
