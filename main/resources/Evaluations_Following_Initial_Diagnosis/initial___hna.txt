To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy, the following evaluations are recommended:

Comprehensive neuromuscular evaluation

Needle EMG to identify the severity and extent of denervation and reinnervation

Evaluation of phrenic nerve involvement by chest x-ray, ultrasound/fluoroscopic evaluation of diaphragm movement, and pulmonary function tests in seated and supine positions

Clinical genetics consultation

For a practical overview of the physical examination and the value of additional investigations in neuralgic amyotrophy see pn.bmj.com.
