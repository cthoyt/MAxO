To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with episodic ataxia type 1, the following evaluations are recommended:

Detailed medical history of the individual

Neurologic examination

Initiation (and observation) of attacks of ataxia by either mild exercise or vestibular stimuli

EMG to confirm the presence of myokymia, particularly if it is not visible on examination

EEG to evaluate for epilepsy [Zuberi et al 1999, Eunson et al 2000, Chen et al 2007]

Consultation with a medical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
