To establish the extent of disease and needs in a newborn diagnosed with thanatophoric dysplasia (TD), the following evaluations are recommended:

Assessment of respiratory status by respiratory rate and skin color; arterial blood gases may be helpful in infants who survive the immediate postnatal period.

Assessment of the presence of hydrocephaly or other central nervous system abnormalities by CT or MRI

Medical genetics consultation and genetic counseling
