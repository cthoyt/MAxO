Neurologic examination

Electrophysiologic studies to establish a baseline for further monitoring of disease progression

Complete blood count (CBC) with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) to evaluate for neutropenia

Ophthalmologic examination for cataract

Consultation with a medical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
