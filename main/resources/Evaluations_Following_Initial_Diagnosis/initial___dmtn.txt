To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with 6q24-related transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (6q24-TNDM), the following evaluations are recommended:

Birth weight, length, and head circumference and any subsequent growth parameters

General dysmorphology examination, preferably by a clinical geneticist including evaluation of tongue size and umbilicus

Neurologic examination and developmental assessment

Investigation of the anatomy of the pancreas by ultrasound examination or MRI

Echocardiogram and ultrasound examination of the liver and kidneys to help identify those infants likely to have 6q24-TNDM caused by mutation of ZFP57

Brain MRI scan if evidence of developmental delay or hypotonia

Serum glucose concentration

C peptide measurement

Pancreatic beta cell autoantibody measurements

Liver function and thyroid function tests

A pediatric endocrinology consultation for follow up of diabetes

Clinical genetics consultation

Patients with hypomethylation at imprinted loci (HIL) should be evaluated for hypotonia and other neurologic features including epilepsy, congenital heart disease, deafness, renal malformations, and pseudohypoparathyroidism with measurement of serum concentrations of calcium and phosphate and parathyroid hormone testing.
