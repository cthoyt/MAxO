To establish the extent of disease in an asymptomatic individual diagnosed with medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency, the following evaluations are recommended:

Plasma acylcarnitine analysis

Plasma free and total carnitine measurement

Urine acylglycine analysis

Urine organic acid analysis

MCAD activity assay in leukocytes (where available)

In a symptomatic individual diagnosed with MCAD deficiency the following additional laboratory studies should be considered:

Blood glucose concentration

Blood gas analysis

Ammonia

Lactic acid

CBC with differential

Electrolytes

Liver function tests

Blood cultures (in case of fever)

Although development is typically normal for individuals treated prospectively, those who experience metabolic decompensations requiring hospitalization often demonstrate developmental and neurologic disabilities. Neurodevelopmental assessments and intervention should therefore be considered for such individuals [Derks et al 2006].
