To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with Costello syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended:

Complete physical and neurologic examination

Plotting of growth parameters, including head circumference

Nutritional assessment

Cardiologic evaluation with two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography, baseline electrocardiography, and Holter examination as needed. Children with HCM and arrhythmia require specialty pediatric cardiology care, which may include exercise testing in certain older cooperative individuals.

Brain MRI, including MRI of the spinal cord as needed, in order to evaluate for Chiari I malformation and sryingomyelia

Ophthalmology evaluation

Clinical assessment of spine and extremities, with particular concern for hip joint abnormalities and range of motion

Multidisciplinary developmental evaluation

Genetics consultation
