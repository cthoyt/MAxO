To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with glycine encephalopathy, the following evaluations are recommended:

MRI of the brain in neonates. The presence of brain malformations is a prognostic indicator of severe outcome. Abnormalities in the posterior fossa should raise suspicion for the development of hydrocephalus. In a single case study, Mourmans et al [2006] showed that serial follow up of the diffusion-weighted images/apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and the diffusion tensor images can provide evidence for the progressive loss of axonal structures seen in children with severe outcome.

EEG. The presence of a burst suppression pattern, rather than multifocal seizures, is a poor prognostic indicator.

Developmental assessment throughout the first years of life

Neurologic assessment in the first year to identify early development of spasticity in severely affected patients and of chorea in more mildly affected patients

Clinical genetics consultation
