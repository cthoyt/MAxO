To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended:

Neurologic history and physical examination for evidence of CNS or peripheral nerve hemangioblastomatosis. A baseline brain and spine MRI is considered standard procedure.

Ophthalmologic evaluation for retinal hemangioblastomas

Abdominal ultrasound examination after age 16 years. Suspicious lesions in the kidney, adrenal gland, or pancreas should be evaluated by more sophisticated techniques, such as CT scan or MRI.

Blood pressure determination, supplemented by measurement of urinary catecholamine metabolites after age five years to evaluate for pheochromocytoma

Audiologic evaluation for hearing loss associated with endolymphatic sac tumors

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
