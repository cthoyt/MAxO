To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with a PNPLA6-related disorder, the following evaluations are recommended:

MRI of the cerebrum (including the pituitary), cerebellum, and spinal cord (including the thoracic cord) to establish the extent of atrophy in the different brain regions and exclude other secondary causes for the clinical features

Nerve conduction studies and EMG to determine the presence and extent of peripheral neuropathy

Neuropsychological investigation, including IQ, attention span, visuospatial abilities, and recall

If not performed at the time of diagnosis, ophthalmologic assessment, including visual acuity, visual field testing, fundoscopy, and optic coherence tomography (OCT) [Synofzik et al 2015]. OCT can detect thinning of the retina, loss of layered retinal architecture, and effacement of the choriocapillaris and choroidal vessels. Autofluorescence photographs and fluorescein angiography provide supplementary diagnostic information by revealing hyper- and hypofluorescent regions of abnormal retinal pigment epithelium and the choriocapillaris.

If not performed at the time of diagnosis, endocrinologic assessment for evidence of hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is detected by decreased rise of gonadotropin levels (LH, FSH) in response to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). (See Isolated Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Deficiency for more details about evaluation.)
