To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), the following evaluations are recommended.

Nutrition/feeding assessment

Time required to complete a feeding

Evidence of fatigue during a feeding/meal

Weight plotted on standard growth curves

Respiratory function assessment

Normal breathing pattern versus abdominal breathing pattern

Forced vital capacity (FVC); in children older than age four years, the hand-held spirometer is accurate. When FVC is above 40%, decompensation during respiratory infection is less likely than when FVC is less than 40%.

Sleep assessment. Consider a sleep study if the child snores during sleep or awakes fatigued in the morning.

Activities of daily living. Assess equipment needed for independence, such as a power-chair and other equipment in the home to improve the quality of life for the affected individual and the caregiver.

Orthopedic evaluation. Evaluate for development of contractures, scoliosis, and hip dislocation.

Other. Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor is recommended.
