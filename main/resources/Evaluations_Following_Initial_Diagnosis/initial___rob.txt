To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with ROR2-related Robinow syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended:

Orofacial assessment to determine the need for plastic surgery (presence of cleft lip and/or cleft palate )

Dental assessment for misaligned, crowded teeth

Clinical and radiographic evaluation of the spine and rib cage to assess the severity of kyphoscoliosis and vertebral and rib anomalies, as these can lead to postural and respiratory complications [Wilcox et al 1997]

Radiographic documentation of the forearm shortening and hand anomalies

Assessment of micropenis for reconstructive surgery if due to penoscrotal transposition

Endocrine investigation to explore possible: (1) gonadotropin and testosterone deficiencies amenable to treatment in males with micropenis; and (2) growth hormone deficiency

Renal ultrasound examination

Echocardiogram to evaluate for structural heart defects
