To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10), the following evaluations are recommended:

MRI. The extent of cerebellar atrophy on serial MRI studies may be useful for documenting the progression of the disease.

EEG. EEG is of particular importance, as many individuals with SCA10 develop epilepsy and epilepsy-related deaths have been recognized [Grewal et al 2002].

Nerve conduction tests. Nerve conduction studies are needed only when affected individuals have clinical evidence of polyneuropathy.

Neuropsychological tests. Formal neuropsychological tests are appropriate for individuals with problems in learning and social adaptation.

Speech pathology evaluation may be needed if dysarthria is atypical or severe enough to cause communication problems. For individuals with frequent choking or severe dysphagia, speech pathology evaluation may be important in assessing aspiration risks.
