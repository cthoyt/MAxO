To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP), the following evaluations are recommended:

Physical examination to evaluate for rashes, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and neurologic dysfunction

Evaluation of blood and bone marrow compartments (CBC and bone marrow biopsy)

Determination of the extent of liver involvement by measuring serum concentration of transaminases, bilirubin, triglycerides, sodium, and lactate dehydrogenase

Identification of potential infectious cofactors (especially viral infection or reactivation) that would require specific treatment

Testing to assess immune function including lymphocyte subset analysis (T cell, B cell, NK cell) and serum concentrations of IgG, IgM, and IgA

Establishing the presence or extent of CNS involvement by evaluating the CSF and performing neuroimaging and neuropsychological assessment

Evaluation of inflammatory factors including serum concentrations of ferritin, sIL2RÎ±, and other cytokines

Evaluation and monitoring of PT, PTT, and fibrinogen

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
