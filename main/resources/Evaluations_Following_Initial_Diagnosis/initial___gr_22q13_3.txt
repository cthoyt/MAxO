To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with Phelan-McDermid syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended:

A complete physical and neurologic examination

Determination of head circumference, height, weight, and other anthropometric measurements

A medical history, focusing on feeding problems, increased incidence of infection, evidence of kidney malfunction and/or gastroesophageal reflux, and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure

Renal ultrasound examination to evaluate for ureteral reflux, dysplastic kidney, multicystic kidneys, and other renal problems

Liver function tests may be warranted given that two individuals had autoimmune hepatitis and liver failure [Tufano et al 2009, Bartsch et al 2010]

Brain imaging studies (MRI, CT scan) in individuals with microcephaly and in individuals with symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure from arachnoid cysts, including irritability, incessant crying, severe headache, cyclic vomiting, and seizures

Multidisciplinary developmental evaluation to assess motor, cognitive, social, and vocational skills

Comprehensive speech/language evaluation including an audiologic examination

A clinical genetics consultation to discuss clinical manifestations, prognosis, natural history, therapies, and recurrence risks

Neurologic consultation to evaluate delays secondary to hypotonia and to monitor acquisition of major milestones

An EEG in individuals with seizures to help determine the appropriate antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). An EEG may also be used to detect subclinical seizure activity.

Evaluation of feeding problems (usually consisting of swallowing or sucking difficulties) by a feeding specialist and/or occupational therapist and speech pathologist

Evaluation of a child with autistic-like features by a child development specialist to identify early intervention programs to meet the child's developmental needs and to minimize atypical behaviors such as tactile defensiveness, anxiety, and self-stimulation

Evaluation for hypothyroidism in individuals who experience changes in behavior including lethargy, decreased activity, cognitive regression, and loss of coordination

Evaluation by an audiologist experienced in testing severely delayed children if hearing deficits are suspected because of recurrent ear infections and lack of expressive speech

Ophthalmologic examination in individuals with strabismus or other indications of visual impairment; assessment of cortical visual impairment by a team including physical therapists, occupational therapists, orientation and mobility specialists, pediatric neurologists, and pediatric ophthalmologists

Sleep study to evaluate for sleep apnea if sleep disturbance is present
