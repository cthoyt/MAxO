To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), the following evaluations are recommended:

Echocardiography. Aortic root measurements must be interpreted based on consideration of normal values for age and body size [Roman et al 1989]. Select findings may require the immediate attention of a cardiologist or cardiothoracic surgeon (e.g., severe aortic dilatation).

MRA or CT scan with 3D reconstruction from head to pelvis to identify arterial aneurysms and arterial tortuosity throughout the arterial tree

Note: Approximately half of the individuals with LDS studied had an aneurysm distant from the aortic root that would not have been detected by echocardiography.

Radiographs to detect skeletal manifestations that may require attention by an orthopedist (e.g., severe scoliosis, cervical spine instability)

Craniofacial examination for evidence of cleft palate and craniosynostosis

Eye examination by an ophthalmologist with expertise in connective tissue disorders that includes: slit-lamp examination through a maximally dilated pupil for exclusion of lens (sub)luxation; careful refraction and visual correction, especially in young children at risk for amblyopia; specific assessment for retinal detachment and blue sclerae
