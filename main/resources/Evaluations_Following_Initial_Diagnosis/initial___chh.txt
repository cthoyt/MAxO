To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with a cartilage-hair hypoplasia â€“ anauxetic dysplasia (CHH-AD) spectrum disorder, the following evaluations are recommended:

Testing. Blood survey for macrocytic anemia and immunodeficiency [Rider et al 2009]:

Complete blood count with differential cell count

Serum concentration of IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgG subclasses

CD3, 4, 8, 19, 16/56

Post-vaccine titers

Other immunologic parameters:

Allogeneic lymphocyte cytotoxicity (ALC)

T-cell receptor excision circles (TREC) analysis

T-cell repertoire

Proliferation response to PHA

Proliferation response to anti-CD3

Imaging. Full skeletal survey including (in AD) views of the cervical spine to identify cervical vertebral abnormalities and to assess the risk for atlantoaxial subluxation

Consultations

Orthopedic. Evaluation for complications of joint laxity, lumbar lordosis, chest deformity, scoliosis, and varus deformity of the lower extremities

Immunologic. For further assessment and treatment if above testing is abnormal or if the child has infections, and to determine the vaccination program and the approach to varicella prophylaxis

Hematologic. For further assessment and treatment if above testing is abnormal

Pulmonary. Evaluation for evidence of respiratory disease

Gastroenterologic. Evaluation for congenital megacolon if clinical observation is suggestive

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
