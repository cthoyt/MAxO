To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with TFR2-related hereditary hemochromatosis (TFR2-HHC), the following are recommended (based on recommendations for HFE-associated hereditary hemochromatosis):

Liver biopsy for evaluation of abnormal liver function tests and establishing prognosis when serum ferritin concentration is greater than 1000 ng/mL and/or when hepatomegaly is present [Guyader et al 1998]

Serum concentration of gonadotropins (FSH and LH) to assess pituitary function. Depending on the results, a GnRH stimulation test may be necessary.

Serum concentration of testosterone to assess testicular function; serum concentration of estradiol to assess ovarian function

Radiographs of the affected joint(s) to assess persistent arthralgia or arthropathy

Cardiac evaluation (ECG and echocardiography) for all symptomatic individuals and those with severe iron overload (ferritin >1000 ng/mL)

Screening for diabetes mellitus by fasting serum glucose concentration and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)
