To establish the extent of disease and needs of a child diagnosed with tyrosinemia type I on the basis of newborn screening, the following evaluations are recommended (see Table 3):

CBC with platelet count

Serum concentration of electrolytes

Assessment of liver function (PT, PTT, AST, ALT, GGT, serum bilirubin concentration, alkaline phosphatase, and serum AFP).

For children ascertained on the basis of clinical symptoms (see Table 4; pdf), testing should include the evaluations listed above in addition to:

Baseline abdominal imagining by CT or MRI (with contrast) to evaluate for liver adenomas or nodules (see Dubois et al [1996]) and renal size;

X-ray of wrist to document presence or absence of rickets.

Clinical genetics consultation is indicated for all affected individuals.
