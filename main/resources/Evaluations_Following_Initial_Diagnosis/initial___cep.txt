To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP), the following evaluations are recommended:

Hematologic indices including reticulocytes and bilirubin (to assess hemolysis) and iron profile (to assess iron storage)

Serum calcium and vitamin D concentrations; bone densitometry

Hepatic function tests

Dermatologic evaluation

Ophthalmologic evaluation

Dental assessment

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Urine and erythrocyte porphyrins can be determined periodically after bone marrow transplant as a monitor of engraftment.
