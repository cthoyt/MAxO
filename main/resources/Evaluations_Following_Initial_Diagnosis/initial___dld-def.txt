To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) deficiency, the following evaluations are recommended:

In the acute setting, measurement/evaluation of:

Blood acid-base status

Plasma/serum concentration of lactate, glucose, and ammonia

Plasma amino acids

Plasma total and free carnitine

Urine organic acids

Liver function and transaminases (ALT/AST)

Liver size via physical examination and/or ultrasonography

Cardiac size via echocardiography

Clinical genetics consultation

After metabolic stability has been achieved:

Clinical assessment of physical growth and development status

Formal ophthalmologic evaluation if concern for vision loss

Brain MRI if clinical concern for Leigh-like syndrome or other structural brain damage

Clinical genetics consultation
