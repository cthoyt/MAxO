To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with a GDAP1-related hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (GDAP1-HMSN), the following evaluations are recommended:

Neurologic examination to determine extent of weakness and atrophy, pes cavus, gait stability, and sensory loss

Physical therapy and occupational therapy assessments regarding muscle weakness and gait and need for ankle foot orthoses, walking aids, and/or a wheelchair [Kennedy et al 2016]

Speech therapy assessment if hoarseness is present or vocal cord paresis is suspected

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
