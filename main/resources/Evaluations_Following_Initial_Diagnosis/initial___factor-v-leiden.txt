To assess the risk for thrombosis in an individual diagnosed with factor V Leiden thrombophilia, the following evaluations are recommended:

Individuals heterozygous for the factor V Leiden allele should be tested for other inherited or acquired thrombophilic disorders. Testing should include:

DNA testing for the prothrombin gene pathogeic variant (G-to-A substitution at nucleotide 20210)

Multiple phospholipid-dependent coagulation assays for a lupus inhibitor

Serologic assays for anticardiolipin antibodies and anti-beta2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies

Evaluation in high-risk individuals (i.e., those with a history of recurrent VTE, especially at young age, or those with strong family history of VTE at young age) should also include assays of:

Protein C activity

Antithrombin activity

Protein S activity or free protein S antigen

Note: (1) Measurement of serum concentration of homocysteine is no longer routinely recommended since no data support a change in duration of anticoagulation or the use of vitamin supplementation in individuals with hyperhomocysteinemia and a history of VTE. In a randomized placebo-controlled trial, supplementation with folic acid, vitamin B12, and pyridoxine did not reduce the incidence of recurrent VTE [den Heijer et al 2007]. (2) There is no clinical rationale for DNA testing for MTHFR polymorphisms. (3) Although routine measurement of factor VIII levels is not recommended, testing may be useful in selected cases [Chandler et al 2002]. (4) It is still unclear whether assessment of clotting factor concentrations should be included in a thrombophilia evaluation [Chandler et al 2002].
