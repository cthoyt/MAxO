To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with hepatic veno-occlusive disease with immunodeficiency (VODI), the following evaluations are recommended:

Assessment of immune function including serum immunoglobulin levels, T- and B-cell numbers and percentages, and T-cell proliferative response to mitogens

More extensive immune testing for number of memory B and T cells and intracellular cytokine (IL2, IL4, IL6, and IFNÎ³) responses to stimulation, if available

Complete blood count

Assessment of hepatic function (including serum concentrations of aminotransferases, bilirubin, and albumin) and assessment for sequelae of portal hypertension (including anemia and thrombocytopenia)

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

A clotting profile and a hepatic Doppler ultrasound examination should be undertaken prior to consideration of hepatic biopsy for a histologic diagnosis of hepatic veno-occlusive disease (hVOD). Evidence of impaired clotting and/or portal hypertension contraindicates hepatic biopsy.
