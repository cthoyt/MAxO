To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual following the initial diagnosis of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS), current consensus practice typically recommends the following evaluations to assess the status of the pancreas, liver, bone marrow, and skeleton [Dror et al 2011]; discussions to update recommendations are ongoing.

Assessment of growth: height, weight in relation to age

Assessment of nutritional status to determine if supplementation with pancreatic enzymes is necessary and/or effective:

Measurement of fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, 25-OH-vitamin D, and vitamin E) or their related metabolites

Measurement of prothrombin time (to detect vitamin K deficiency)

Assessment of serum concentration of the digestive enzyme cationic trypsinogen and, if sufficiency is observed, subsequent confirmation with a 72-hour fecal fat balance study (with discontinuation of enzyme supplementation for at least a 24-hour period)

Pancreatic imaging by ultrasound

Complete blood count with white cell differential and platelet count at three- to six-month intervals (or more often as clinically indicated)

Bone marrow examination with biopsy and cytogenetic studies at initial assessment

Skeletal survey with radiographs of at least the hips and lower limbs

Bone densitometry as clinically indicated

Assessment of serum aminotransferase levels

Assessment of developmental milestones (including pubertal development) with neuropsychological evaluation

Medical genetics consultation
