To establish the extent of disease and the needs of an individual diagnosed with an ADAMTSL4-related eye disorder, routine ophthalmologic examination that includes the following is recommended:

Determination of visual acuity and refractive error

Measurement of intraocular pressure

Note: Affected individuals may have increased central corneal thickness that could explain, to some extent, why some individuals have moderately elevated intraocular pressure, but few have glaucomatous damage of the optic nerve head.

Slit lamp examination

Ophthalmoscopy

The following may also provide important information:

Orthoptic examination, particularly in children

Measurement of axial length

Anterior segment examination with optical coherence tomography (OCT) and ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM)

Corneal topography including measurement of central corneal thickness

Gonioscopy
