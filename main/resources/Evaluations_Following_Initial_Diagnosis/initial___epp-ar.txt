To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), the following evaluations are recommended:

Assessment of erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels (free and zinc-chelated), hematologic indices, and iron profile if not performed as part of diagnostic testing

Assessment of hepatic function as well as imaging studies such as abdominal sonogram if cholelithiasis is suspected

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
