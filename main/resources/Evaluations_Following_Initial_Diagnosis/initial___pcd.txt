To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), the following evaluations are recommended:

Pulmonary disease

Respiratory cultures (typically sputum cultures) to define infecting organisms and to direct antimicrobial therapy. Specific cultures for non-tuberculous mycobacteria should be included for older children and adults.

Chest radiographs and/or chest CT to define distribution and severity of airway disease and bronchiectasis

Pulmonary function tests (spirometry) to define severity of obstructive impairment

Pulse oximetry, with overnight saturation studies if borderline

Nasal congestion and/or sinus symptoms. Sinus imaging (sinus x-rays or preferably sinus CT)

Chronic/recurrent ear infections. Formal hearing evaluation (See Deafness and Hereditary Hearing Loss Overview for hearing evaluations available at different ages.)

Other. Clinical genetics consultation
