To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Hartsfield syndrome, the following evaluations are recommended:

Determine the type of holoprosencephaly (alobar, semilobar, or lobar) by neuroimaging, preferably a brain MRI.

Assess development including evidence of spasticity.

Evaluate suspicious activity for evidence of seizures.

Evaluate nutritional status and feeding for evidence of problems that may result from cleft lip/palate and/or oromotor dysfunction and other problems that may result from gastrointestinal involvement (e.g., slow gastric emptying, gastroesophageal reflux, constipation).

Evaluate for evidence of diabetes insipidus, temperature dysregulation, and/or disturbance of sleep-wake cycles.

Evaluate for evidence of endocrine deficiency (growth hormone deficiency, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, central diabetes insipidus).

Consult with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor.
