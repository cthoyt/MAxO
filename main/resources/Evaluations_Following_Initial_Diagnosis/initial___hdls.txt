To establish the extent of disease and needs of an individual diagnosed with adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP), the following evaluations are recommended:

Complete neurologic assessment

Psychological and psychiatric assessments

Brain MRI to determine the extent and localization of white matter changes, presence of cortical atrophy, and involvement of the corpus callosum and corticospinal tracts

Assessment of feeding/eating, digestive problems (constipation, incontinence), and nutrition based on patient history

EEG or video EEG if a seizure disorder is suspected; evaluation of the need for antiepileptic drugs

Lumbar puncture to measure neurofilament light protein (NFL) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to follow the disease progression. An increased level of NFL on repeat CSF examinations may suggest faster disease course and thus worse prognosis.

Assessment of family and social structure to determine the availability of adequate support system

Clinical genetics consultation
