To establish the extent of involvement and needs in an individual diagnosed with nonsyndromic hearing loss, DFNA3, the following evaluations are recommended:

Complete assessment of auditory acuity using age-appropriate tests including ABR testing, auditory steady-state response (ASSR) testing, and/or pure tone audiometry (see Deafness and Hereditary Hearing Loss Overview).

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
