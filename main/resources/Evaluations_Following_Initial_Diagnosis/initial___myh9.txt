To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with an MYH9-related disorder (MYH9RD), the following evaluations are recommended:

Microscopic assessment of platelet count (phase contrast microscopy by a counting chamber) to determine the degree of thrombocytopenia

In individuals with bleeding episodes, complete blood count to evaluate for anemia

In individuals with anemia, serum concentration of iron and ferritin level to evaluate for iron deficiency

Audiometric evaluation

In those with severe to profound deafness, speech recognition tests

Measurement of serum concentration of AST, ALT, and GGT

Urinalysis, including measurement of 24-hour protein or protein (or albumin)/creatinine ratio on a spot urine sample, and measurement of serum concentration of creatinine

In individuals with established renal involvement, testing appropriate to the severity of renal disease

Ophthalmologic examination

Consultation with a medical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
