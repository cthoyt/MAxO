To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with a GLB1-related disorder (GM1 gangliosidosis or MPS IVB), the following evaluations are recommended:

Developmental history and assessment to document past and current motor and cognitive function, as a baseline in the event of future psychomotor and/or cognitive regression

Physical examination for evidence of hepatosplenomegaly

Ophthalmologic examination, especially for evidence of corneal clouding and cherry red spot of the macula

Evaluation by a pediatric cardiologist (including electrocardiogram and echocardiogram) to assess for cardiac involvement

Skeletal survey to determine the extent of skeletal involvement

Flexion and extension x-rays of the cervical spine to assess for atlanto-axial instability

Electroencephalogram to assess for seizure disorder, if indicated

Clinical genetics consultation with genetic counseling
