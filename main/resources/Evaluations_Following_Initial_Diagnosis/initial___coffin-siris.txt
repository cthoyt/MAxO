Neurologic and/or developmental examination to record developmental milestones and identify neurologic symptoms or deficits

Evaluation for occupational, speech, or physical therapy as needed

Gastrointestinal evaluation for feeding difficulties or poor growth

Dietary evaluation by a nutritionist as needed

Ophthalmologic examination, including a dilated fundus examination and visual acuity

Audiology evaluation with auditory brain stem response testing and otoacoustic emission testing to assess for hearing loss

Echocardiogram to evaluate for structural cardiac defects

Renal ultrasonography to evaluate for structural kidney or genitourinary (GU) anomalies
