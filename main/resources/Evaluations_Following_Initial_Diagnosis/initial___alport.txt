To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Alport syndrome and thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN) the following evaluations are recommended:

Evaluation of renal function

Overt proteinuria (urine protein-creatinine ratio >0.2 or, in a child, 24-hour urine protein >4 mg/m2/hr) is an important indicator of renal disease progression in individuals with Alport syndrome and thin basement membrane nephropathy. Urine protein excretion should be assessed at the time of diagnosis and at least annually thereafter.

In Alport syndrome and thin basement membrane nephropathy, decreased glomerular filtration and hypertension rarely appear before overt proteinuria. Once overt proteinuria has developed, renal function should be assessed periodically by serum creatinine concentration or other estimates of glomerular filtration rate (e.g., creatinine clearance or serum cystatin C levels) and blood pressure should be monitored.

Hearing evaluation. High-frequency sensorineural deafness typically becomes detectable by audiogram in late childhood (age 6-10 years) in boys with XLAS and in boys and girls with ARAS.

Ophthalmologic evaluation

Assessment of ocular status is often unnecessary if the diagnosis of Alport syndrome is established by other means. The maculopathy is asymptomatic, and anterior lenticonus is also frequently asymptomatic.

Individuals who experience acute corneal erosion should be seen by an ophthalmologist.

Cardiac evaluation. Baseline evaluation including echocardiogram for aortic dilation in males with XLAS is indicated.

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
