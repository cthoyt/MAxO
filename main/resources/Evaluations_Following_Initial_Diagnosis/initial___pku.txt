To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency, the following evaluations are recommended:

Medical biochemical genetics consultation, if not already done, and evaluation by a metabolic dietician able to begin a low Phe, age-appropriate diet

Blood phenylalanine concentration and estimation of phenylalanine tolerance [Kayaalp et al 1997, Guldberg et al 1998]. Because the PAH genotype may not always predict phenotype (see Genotype-Phenotype Correlations), the individual's diet should be tailored to the estimated phenylalanine tolerance irrespective of genotype.

For individuals diagnosed outside the newborn period, formal developmental, behavioral, neuropsychological, and mental health evaluation
