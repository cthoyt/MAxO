To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with a CHCHD10-related disorder, the following evaluations are recommended:

A structured general medical history and family history

Physical examination and neurologic examination

EMG/NCS to document the regions of involvement and indicate lower motor neuron and/or myopathic involvement

Evaluation of the extent and profile of cognitive disturbance by neuropsychological examination

Neuroimaging with MRI if not done at time of initial diagnosis.

Pulmonary function testing to detect and stage respiratory involvement

Speech and swallowing evaluation if dysarthria and/or dysphagia are present to direct care to minimize risk of aspiration and to initiate augmentative communication strategies for possible loss of verbal communication

Audiologic examination, including auditory brain stem responses (ABRs) and evoked otoacoustic emissions

Physical and occupational therapy evaluation to determine the adaptive devices needed to maximize function

Nutritional evaluation

Screening to detect depression and assess need for psychosocial support

Clinical genetics consultation
