To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS), the following evaluations are recommended if they have not already been completed:

Assessment for cortisol deficiency. This must be performed urgently in individuals who have no family history of PHS and in individuals who have family members with PHS and cortisol deficiency. Of note, adrenal crisis can be lethal in infants who have not undergone proper evaluation and treatment for adrenal insufficiency.

Consultation by an endocrinologist, including evaluation of growth hormone secretion, FSH and LH secretion, and serum concentration of thyroid hormone in early infancy after evaluation for and treatment of ACTH deficiency

Cranial MRI to establish the location and extent of hamartoma

Neurologic examination to exclude signs of intracranial hypertension, which is not typical of hypothalamic hamartomas

Visualization of the epiglottis by laryngoscopy; urgent evaluation by an otolaryngologist for laryngotracheal cleft when signs or symptoms of aspiration are present; elective evaluation by an otolaryngologist in asymptomatic individuals for the purpose of establishing the diagnosis or establishing the extent of anomalies

Limb radiographs to distinguish postaxial polydactyly from central polydactyly

Evaluation by a hand surgeon to assess the timing and surgical approach to correct the polydactyly. Note that the surgical correction of mesoaxial polydactyly is typically more complex than for postaxial polydactyly and should be undertaken by an expert surgeon.

Renal ultrasonography to evaluate for renal anomalies

Surgical consultation for imperforate anus or anal stenosis if present

Developmental assessment

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
