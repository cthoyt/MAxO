To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS), the following evaluations are recommended if they have not already been completed:

Formal audiology evaluation for extent of hearing loss

Cardiac examination including calculation of QTc

A three-generation family history that focuses on cardiac disease, syncope, and hearing ability

Complete blood count to screen for anemia. If anemia is present, screening for iron deficiency is recommended.

Consultation with a clinical geneticist
