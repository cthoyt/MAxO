To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN), the following evaluations are recommended:

Complete neurologic examination and developmental assessment including evaluation of motor function, speech/language, swallowing, and sleep

EEG monitoring, including sleep EEG, for any child with features (by history or observation) to suggest overt or occult seizures. Early referral to a neurology epilepsy sub-specialist is recommended if hypsarrhythmia or another aggressive electrographic pattern is found on EEG.

Assessments by specialists in physical, occupational, and/or speech therapy

Ophthalmologic examination

Assessment of nutrition by a nutritionist or dietician

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
