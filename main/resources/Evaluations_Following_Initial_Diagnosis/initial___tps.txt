To establish the extent of disease and support needs of an individual diagnosed with trichorhinophalangeal syndrome (TRPS), the following should be evaluated.

For TRPS I and TRPS II

Measurement of height

Developmental assessment, at younger age for both TRPS I and TRPS II as the distinction may clinically not yet be possible. At an older age, only for TRPS II

X-rays of hands, feet, pelvis, and hip, if symptomatic

If evidence of osteopenia on x-ray, further investigation of bone mineral density and metabolism may be warranted

Dental examination for supernumerary teeth

Cardiac evaluation (once)

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

For TRPS II only

Review of osteochondromas by an orthopedic specialist for evidence of functional limitation

Evaluation of vison and hearing as is recommended in all persons with intellectual disability of any cause
