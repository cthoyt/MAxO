To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with SHOX deficiency, physical examination with attention to the following is indicated [Rappold et al 2007, Binder 2011]:

Growth parameters. Height, arm span, and sitting height. Calculate extremities to trunk ratio or sitting height to height ratio (see Diagnosis).

Assessment of pubertal stage in preadolescents to determine if use of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) is appropriate

Madelung deformity. Prominence of distal ulna, limitation of forearm pronation and supination, and wrist pain

Scoliosis

Body mass index that is frequently above the mean; mainly because of shortening of the legs
