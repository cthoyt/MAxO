To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with LMNA-related DCM, the following evaluations are recommended.

Comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation

Evaluation for conduction system disease and arrhythmia:

Personal and family history of presyncope, syncope, resuscitated sudden cardiac death, palpitations, and other symptoms of arrhythmia

Follow up of abnormalities with additional testing as indicated (e.g., 24-hour monitoring or event monitors)

Referral to a cardiologist or electrophysiologist for any indication of symptomatic disease

Indicated in some patients: invasive electrophysiologic evaluation for conduction system disease

Evaluation for left ventricular dysfunction and DCM:

Family history for cardiomyopathy of any type, personal history of shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, chest pain

Assessment of left ventricular function (most commonly by two-dimensional echocardiography) to determine left ventricular dimension and function. Alternatively, MRI provides similar data, and radionuclide ventriculography provides a measure of the ejection fraction.

Measurement of serum CK concentration to evaluate for skeletal myopathy

In some affected individuals elevated serum CK concentrations with or without a skeletal muscle myopathy similar to Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy or limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is observed.

If CK levels are elevated, an evaluation for skeletal muscle weakness, including neuromuscular evaluation, may be necessary.

History and physical examination for signs and symptoms of skeletal myopathy. If there is evidence of myopathy, refer to a neuromuscular disease specialist for evaluation.

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor
