To establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with parkin type of early-onset Parkinson disease, the following evaluations are recommended:

Assess the presence and the severity of parkinsonian signs, non-motor features and treatment-related complications using the Unified Parkinsonâ€™s disease rating scale (UPDRS) [Fahn & Elton 1987] or the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) UPDRS [Goetz et al 2008].

Assess the presence of atypical signs, such as hyperreflexia and dystonia.

Evaluate the degree of response to treatment.

Assess for cognitive or behavioral problems.

Consider clinical genetics consultation.
