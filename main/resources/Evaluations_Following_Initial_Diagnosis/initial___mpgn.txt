After the diagnosis of dense deposit disease/membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II (DDD/MPGNII) has been made, the following evaluations are recommended:

Evaluate the complement system by measuring serum concentration of CH50, APH50, C3, C3d, C4, factor H and sMAC. (For a list of laboratories providing these tests, contact Richard Smith. See Author Notes.)

Complement protein measures in DDD/MPGNII are distinctive, with most patients having only low serum concentrations of C3, while serum concentrations of properdin, C5, and other terminal proteins are within the normal range.

Factor H serum concentrations can be low, as has been reported with pathogenic missense variants in the CFH coding sequence that block protein secretion from the endoplasmic reticulum [Ault et al 1997, Dragon-Durey et al 2004].

Measure autoantibodies including C3NeF, factor H autoantibodies (FHAA) and factor B autoantibodies (FBAA).

Screen CFH for pathogenic variants using bidirectional sequencing.

Establish the extent of renal disease by measuring serum creatinine concentration, and monitor creatinine clearance, proteinuria and hematuria.

Obtain a baseline ophthalmologic examination [McAvoy et al 2004].
