To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with Laing distal myopathy, the following evaluations are recommended:

A full neurologic history and examination at presentation, with particular reference to early gross motor milestones. The examination should particularly note tightening of the tendo Achilles (Figure 1) and the pattern of muscle weakness.

As severe cardiac manifestations are a feature in one third of individuals with Laing distal myopathy, an electrocardiogram and echocardiogram should be performed as a baseline.

Electromyography/nerve conduction studies

Medical genetics consultation
