To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HOKPP), the following evaluations are recommended:

During an acute paralytic attack:

Assessment of respiratory status to detect those individuals who may have early respiratory failure

Measurement of serum potassium concentration

Cardiac electrophysiologic testing (electrocardiagram) to assess for life-threatening cardiac consequences of hypokalemia

Assessment for swallowing difficulty

Between attacks or in a currently asymptomatic individual:

Neurologic examination to assess muscle strength in the legs

Measurement of the following thyroid functions (see Note):

Plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)

Free thyroxine (FT4)

Free triiodothyronine (FT3)

In those with fixed muscle weakness, consideration of CT scan of muscles to evaluate the extent of myopathy

Clinical genetics consultation

Note: (1) Hyperthyroidism may be a trigger for a hypokalemic episode in individuals with HOKPP; (2) thyroid function tests may help to distinguish between HOKPP and TPP in those who have a pathogenic variant in KCNJ18.
