Ectodermal manifestations. Evaluation by a dermatologist for identification of dermal aplasia or erosive skin that may benefit from treatment with dressings or lotion

Papillomatosis

Evaluation by an otolaryngologist for evidence of laryngeal or peri-tonsillar verrucoid papillomas, which can cause obstructive sleep apnea.

Sleep study to evaluate for obstructive sleep apnea (often due to airway papillomas).

Limb and skeletal manifestations. Chest x-ray to evaluate for costovertebral defects and evidence of diaphragmatic hernia

Eye findings. Eye examination to evaluate for iris colobomas, chorioretinal colobomas, nystagmus, strabismus or cataracts

Oral and dental findings

Evaluation by a cleft palate team if relevant

Examination by a dentist beginning with the first teeth around age one year

Gastrointestinal and nutrition

Consideration of abdominal ultrasound examination to evaluate for diaphragmatic hernia

Evaluation by a gastroenterologist if gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is an issue

Renal and urogenital

Renal ultrasound examination to evaluate for structural anomalies of the kidneys and urinary collecting system

Evaluation by a pediatric gynecologist prior to puberty. Imaging studies of the reproductive tract should be considered as anomalies can affect fertility.
