To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with chorea-acanthocytosis (ChAc), the following evaluations are recommended:

Swallowing assessment

Electroencephalography to allow for early detection of signs indicating an increased risk for epileptic seizures and consideration of use of antiepileptic drugs

Neuropsychological assessment to identify and address possible psychosocial complications

Electromyography and nerve conduction testing to document the extent of neuromuscular disease

Physical therapy evaluation to identify and address areas of possible benefit

Clinical genetics consultation may be considered.
