Frequent transfusion with platelets can lead to alloimmunization and increased risk of infection. It is therefore recommended that platelet transfusion in older individuals not be done until platelet counts fall below a particular threshold (10/nL). Note: The threshold for platelet transfusion in newborns is unknown.
