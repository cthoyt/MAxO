Immunizations. All individuals with GLB1-related disorders should receive routine immunizations. Influenza and pneumococcal immunizations should be administered on schedule because of the low pulmonary reserve of individuals with MPS IVB and the risk for secondary infections due to chronic disease in children with GM1 gangliosidosis.

Bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis is recommended for all high-risk patients, including those with a prosthetic cardiac valve, prosthetic material used for cardiac valve repair, or previous infective endocarditis [Wilson et al 2007].

Anesthesia. Because children with MPS IVB and those with GM1 gangliosidosis with skeletal involvement (spine anomalies, short neck, large head, and atlantoaxial instability) are at increased risk for complications of anesthesia, the following are recommended [Walker et al 2013]:

Preoperative evaluation should include a history of complications with previous anesthetics, as well as any ongoing problems with airway obstruction, the heart, and respiratory function.

Obtain flexion/extension x-rays of the lateral cervical spine [Muhlebach et al 2011; Tomatsu et al 2011; Author, unpublished observations].

Fiber-optic bronchoscopy and smaller than expected endotracheal tubes are often required [Muhlebach et al 2011].

For procedures lasting greater than 45 minutes, intraoperative spinal cord monitoring may be necessary to detect exacerbation of pre-existing spinal stenosis.

Post-operative management may be complicated by pre-existing sleep apnea and/or pulmonary edema [Morgan et al 2002].
