Regardless of its etiology, uncorrected hearing loss has consistent sequelae: Auditory deprivation through age two years is associated with poor reading performance, poor communication skills, and poor speech production. Educational intervention is insufficient to completely remediate these deficiencies.

In contrast, early auditory intervention (whether through amplification or cochlear implantation) is effective (see Deafness and Hereditary Hearing Loss Overview). However, the presence of severe inner ear anomalies and Michel aplasia in individuals with LAMM syndrome limits auditory habilitation options.

Delayed gross development (presumably the result of impaired balance and profound deafness) increases the risk for accidents and trauma.

The risk for accidents can be addressed in part by use of visual or vibrotactile alarm systems in homes and schools.

The risk for pedestrian injury can be reduced by choosing routes with visual displays of crosswalks.

Anticipatory education of parents, health providers, and educational programs about hazards can help address the risk for falls [Gaebler-Spira & Thornton 2002, Chakravarthy et al 2007].
