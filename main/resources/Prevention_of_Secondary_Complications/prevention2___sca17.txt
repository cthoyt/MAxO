The side effects of psychotropic medications and AEDs (e.g., depression, sedation, nausea, restlessness, headache, neutropenia, and tardive dsykinesia) can be major secondary complications in persons with SCA17. For some individuals, the side effects of certain therapeutics may be worse than the symptoms of the disease; such individuals may benefit from total or intermittent discontinuation of the treatment or reduction in dose.
