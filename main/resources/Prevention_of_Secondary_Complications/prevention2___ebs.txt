Infection is the most common secondary complication. Surveillance for wound infection is important and treatment with topical and/or systemic antibiotics or silver-impregnated dressings or gels can be helpful.

Additional nutritional support may be required for failure to thrive in infants and children with EBS-gen sev or EBS-gen intermed who have more severe involvement. Infants with significant oral disease may develop an aversion to eating by mouth, even after oral disease improves. The involvement of a feeding therapist in these cases is suggested.

Management of fluid and electrolyte problems is critical, as they can be significant and even life-threatening in the neonatal period and in infants with widespread disease.

Some children have delays or difficulty walking because of blistering and hyperkeratosis, especially in EBS-gen sev. Appropriate footwear and physical therapy are essential to preserve ambulation.
