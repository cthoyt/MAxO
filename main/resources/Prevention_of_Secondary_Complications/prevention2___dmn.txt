Aggressive treatment and frequent monitoring of blood glucose concentrations is essential to avoid acute complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia.

Long-term complications of diabetes mellitus can be significantly reduced by maintaining blood glucose concentrations in the appropriate range. The American Diabetes Association recommends the following glycemic goals across all pediatric age-groups [American Diabetes Association 2016a]:

Glycemic targets for children younger than age six years:

90-130 mg/dL before meals

90-150 mg/dL at bedtime/overnight

Hemoglobin A1c value < 7.5%
