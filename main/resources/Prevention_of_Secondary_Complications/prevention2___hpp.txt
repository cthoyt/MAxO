Creating a safe environment, getting help in case of paralytic attack, and preventing falls and accidents are critical [Levitt 2008].

An affected person experiencing a paralytic attack must have access to potassium as well as physical assistance. Thus, those with HOKPP should inform their companions or acquaintances of their risk for paralytic attack, especially in a sports or school context, so that they can access appropriate help rapidly in case of an attack.

Falls and injuries from falls are frequent in those with HOKPP (67% of affected individuals age >40 years report such falls and injuries) [Cavel-Greant et al 2012].

Pre- or postoperative paralysis. Because of the risk for paralysis preceding or following anesthesia, precautions should be taken during administration of anesthesia to individuals with HOKPP. Individuals with HOKPP should be considered susceptible to malignant hyperthermia and managed with a non-triggering anesthetic technique â€“ although general anesthesia using volatile anesthetics and succinylcholine has been reported as safe in a small number of individuals with HOKPP.

General guidelines for perioperative care include the following:

Strict control of serum potassium concentration

Avoidance of large glucose and salt loads

Low-carbohydrate diet

Maintenance of body temperature and acid-base balance

Careful use of neuromuscular blocking agents with continuous monitoring of neuromuscular function [Hofer et al 2001]

Late-onset myopathy with fixed muscle weakness. It is not known whether the prevention of paralytic attacks also prevents the development of myopathy. Individuals with known pathogenic variants who developed myopathy without having experienced episodes of weakness have been reported.
