Regular monitoring by a biochemical geneticist and a dietitian is necessary to avoid insufficient or excessive protein restriction. Many factors should be taken into account to guide protein restriction: age, gender, severity of PA, nutritional status, and presence of other factors such as intercurrent illness, surgery, level of physical activity, and growth spurts. The effects of excessive protein restriction can include impaired growth, essential amino acid deficiencies, and metabolic decompensations.

Acrodermatitis enteropathica, hair loss, and cutaneous Candida infections in patients with PA managed with medical foods can be caused by essential amino acid deficiency and require a re-appraisal of the nutritional management.

Psychotic episodes in patients with PA have been infrequently reported [Dejean de la BÃ¢tie et al 2014]. Similar to other inborn errors of metabolism, care should be exercised when using antipsychotic medications as they can mask clinical signs of encephalopathy or cause adverse effects.
