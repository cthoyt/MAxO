Facial palsy. Because the facial nerves are often ectopic, an MRI to determine the location of the facial nerves is appropriate before craniofacial surgery or cochlear implantation is considered.

Anesthesia. The airway problems associated with anesthesia in individuals with CHARGE syndrome can be attributed to choanal atresia, cleft lip and palate, and other upper-airway problems observed in approximately half of individuals with CHARGE syndrome. The soft cartilage and resultant floppy trachea add to potential anesthesia risk. Neurogenic incoordination of swallow and closure of the epiglottis may complicate the postoperative course, especially with repeated general anesthetics. If possible, procedures should be combined to reduce the overall use of anesthesia.
