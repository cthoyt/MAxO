Although malignant hyperthermia has not been described in CFTD, it has been seen in other congenital myopathies, particularly RYR1-associated myopathies; therefore, precautions for malignant hyperthermia prior to anesthesia should be considered (see Malignant Hyperthermia Susceptibility.)

Preoperative assessment of pulmonary and cardiac function is recommended to avoid complications.

Prevention of scoliosis, respiratory and feeding issues, and cardiac disease may be possible with comprehensive early screening and regular monitoring as described in Treatment of Manifestations.

Contractures may be avoided by consistent joint movement or therapy.
