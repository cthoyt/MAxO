Individuals with FA treated with HSCT who developed graft vs host disease (GVHD) had a 28% incidence of head and neck cancers in the ten years following treatment (vs 0% in those without GVHD); this finding points to the importance of minimizing the risk of GVHD [Guardiola et al 2004]. Increased risk for GVHD observed in earlier studies was reduced significantly by T-cell depletion of the donor graft [Chaudhury et al 2008, MacMillan et al 2015].

Individuals successfully treated with HSCT are at increased risk for solid tumors, in addition to the baseline increased risk [Rosenberg et al 2005]. Due to the known contribution of radiation to the long-term complication of secondary solid tumors most recent efforts have focused on using a conditioning regimen without radiation even in an unrelated donor setting. German, Brazilian, and US groups now report excellent outcomes with alternative donors with a 'chemotherapy-only' preparative regimen in single-center studies. The study from Germany showed 88% survival and normal hematopoiesis at a median follow up of 30 months [Bonfim et al 2015, Chao et al 2015]. A prospective multi-institutional US study also showed similar excellent outcomes. One-year probabilities of overall and disease-free survival for the entire cohort, including patients with myeloid malignancy and those receiving mismatched related/haploidentical grafts, were 80% and 77.7% respectively at a median follow-up of 41 months. All young children (age <10 years) undergoing HSCT for marrow failure using low-dose busulfan-containing regimen survived [Mehta et al 2017].
