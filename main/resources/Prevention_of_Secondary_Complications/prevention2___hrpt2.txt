The risk of post-operative hypoparathyroidism can be minimized by: ensuring normal preoperative 25-(OH) vitamin D concentrations; recognizing risk factors for hungry bone syndrome preoperatively (e.g., elevated serum alkaline phosphatase concentration); and implementing close postoperative monitoring that includes prompt replacement of calcium and vitamin D as indicated. Minimization of postoperative nausea and vomiting can help prevent an increase in venous pressure, which could lead to oozing and devascularization of the remaining in situ parathyroid glands.

Biopsy of extrathyroidal tissue in the neck should be avoided when possible to reduce the risk of seeding of a possible parathyroid carcinoma.

An en bloc resection should be considered in all patients suspected of having parathyroid carcinoma in order to optimize a surgical cure and prevent positive surgical margins or seeding of parathyroid tissue during removal.
