Secondary complications are mainly related to therapy.

Beta-blockers could worsen allergic asthma. Therefore, the cardiac-specific beta-blocker, metoprolol, could be indicated in some individuals with CPVT who have a history of asthma. The dose of metoprolol is based on the need of the affected individual (â‰¤3 mg/kg). Note: It is important to keep in mind that metoprolol and newer beta-blockers (e.g., bisorpolol) may not have the same efficacy as nadolol or propranolol; the reasons for this are under investigation.

For persons with an ICD, anticoagulation to prevent formation of thrombi may be necessary (particularly in children who require looping of the right ventricular catheter).
