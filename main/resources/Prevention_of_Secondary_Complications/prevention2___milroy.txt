Secondary cellulitis is prevented through the following measures:

Prevention of foot infections, particularly athlete's foot/infected eczema

Prompt treatment for early cellulitis with appropriate antibiotics. It may be necessary to give the first few doses intravenously.

Prophylactic antibiotics in recurrent cases (e.g., penicillin V 500 mg daily)
