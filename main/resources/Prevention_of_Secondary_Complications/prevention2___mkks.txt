Recurrent urinary tract infections and re-stenosis of the vaginal orifice are the most common complications in individuals with MKS following surgical drainage of the HMC [Slavotinek & Biesecker 2000].

Care should be taken with anesthesia in the neonatal period if severe hydrometrocolpos causing diaphragmatic compression is present. Gastric decompression and preoxygenation prior to tracheal intubation were used in the anesthetic management of one neonate with severe hydrometrocolpos compressing the diaphragm [Tekin et al 2003].
