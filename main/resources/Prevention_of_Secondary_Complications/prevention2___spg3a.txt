Musculoskeletal abnormalities including muscle tendon contractures, scoliosis, and foot deformities are the secondary complications most likely to occur, resulting from long-standing spasticity and weakness. Intense and regular therapy for spasticity, including physiotherapy, can delay and minimize the appearance of these complications. The higher incidence of orthopedic problems in patients with SPG3A may be related to early age of onset and these patients should be followed by an orthopedist if problems are present.

Urinary bladder incontinence can be a secondary complication of a neurogenic bladder and urologic care may be needed.

Patients with advanced disease may experience falls with a risk of traumatic injury. A walking aid (cane, walker, or wheelchair) may need to be considered in patients experiencing falls.
