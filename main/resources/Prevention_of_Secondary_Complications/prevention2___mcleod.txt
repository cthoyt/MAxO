Transfusion hazards secondary to anti-Kx antibody production resulting from previous exposure to Kx antigens during homologous blood transfusion must be considered in:

All males with the McLeod blood group phenotype [Russo et al 2000b], in particular males with X-linked chronic granulomatous disease resulting from a contiguous gene deletion of CYBB and XK (see Diagnosis, Contiguous Gene Rearrangements) [Holland 2005]; and

Carrier females with the McLeod blood group phenotype.

Kx-negative blood or, if possible, banked autologous blood should be used for transfusions.
