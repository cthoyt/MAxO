Treatment concentrates on prevention of secondary complications. Prevention of substantial handicap from the disease can be achieved by appropriate expert treatment of tumors:

A cervical spinal scan should be performed before cranial surgery to prevent complications from manipulation under anesthesia [Evans et al 2005a].

Spinal tumors may make epidural analgesia difficult; therefore, lumbosacral imaging should be performed before regional analgesia is given [Sakai et al 2005, Spiegel et al 2005].
