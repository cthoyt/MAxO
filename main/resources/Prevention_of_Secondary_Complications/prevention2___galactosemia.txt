Because bone mineral density in children and adults with classic galactosemia and clinical variant galactosemia may be diminished, supplements of vitamin D in excess of 1000 IU/day and vitamin K have been advocated [Panis et al 2006b, Batey et al 2013].

For calcium and vitamin D intake for individuals with classic and clinical variant galactosemia, see the recommended dietary allowances and adequate intakes (pdf) from the Health and Medicine Division of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.

If routine follow-up visits with a dietitian knowledgeable about metabolic disorders have verified that calcium and vitamin D intake are adequate for age and if plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D is within the normal range but bone mineral density is decreased, consultation with a pediatric and/or adult endocrinologist may be warranted.
