Management



Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis



To establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy (CC2L), the following evaluations are recommended:

Neurologic examination

Brain MRI if not performed at the time of diagnostic work up

Physical therapy/occupational therapy assessment, if significant neurologic problems are present

Ophthalmologic examination with attention to visual acuity and visual fields

Audiologic examination

For adult males: evaluation of testicular function

Consultation with a clinical geneticist and/or genetic counselor

Treatment of Manifestations



Supportive therapy includes the following as needed:

Physical therapy and rehabilitation to improve motor function

Special education

Treatment of headache

Guidance for visual impairment

For males with infertility: consultation with a male infertility specialist

Surveillance



Annual evaluations including:

Neurologic examination

Ophthalmologic examination

Audiologic assessment

MRI follow up can be performed once every few years, in the event that the neurologic manifestations change.

Evaluation of Relatives at Risk



Using the CLCN2 pathogenic variants identified in the proband, it is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify those who would benefit from early diagnosis and routine surveillance for motor, cognitive, vision, and hearing impairment.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management



No pregnancy complications have been identified in affected women to date [Author, personal observation].
