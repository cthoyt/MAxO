Breast cancer

Consider prophylactic bilateral mastectomy

Given the conflicting data on the degree of risk reduction of breast cancer associated with prophylactic oophorectomy, consider discussing the risks and benefits of this approach with a genetics specialist.

Chemoprevention. In a retrospective study tamoxifen reduced the risk for breast cancer by 62% among healthy women with a BRCA2 germline variant [King et al 2001]. The sample size, however, was extremely small. In a nested case-control study, tamoxifen use was associated with a 41%-50% reduction in the risk of developing contralateral breast cancer [Narod et al 2000, Metcalfe et al 2005]. There have been no prospective randomized trials of tamoxifen as a chemoprevention agent in women with BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants.

Breast feeding for a cumulative total of more than one year reduced the risk for breast cancer [Jernstr√∂m et al 2004].

Ovarian cancer/fallopian tube cancer

Consider prophylactic oophorectomy, recognizing that completion of childbearing may factor into this decision. Several studies have documented a significant (80%-96%) risk reduction in ovarian cancer following risk-reducing oophorectomy [Kauff et al 2002, Rebbeck et al 2002, Rutter et al 2003].

Salpingectomy. Recent advances in understanding the molecular events preceding ovarian cancer have established the fallopian tube as the origin of the majority of high-grade serous ovarian cancers, leading to the consideration of salpingectomy with ovarian retention until the age of natural menopause as the first step in primary prevention. This approach is likely to reduce the health hazards of premature menopause, but its adoption will require prospective data to establish its safety and efficacy [Daly et al 2015].

Tubal ligation. A meta-analysis of 13 studies showed a reduction in risk for ovarian cancer of 34% in the general population after tubal ligation [Cibula et al 2011]. A meta-analysis of modifiers of risk of cancer in individuals with pathogenic variants in BRCA1/2 found a reduction in the risk of ovarian cancer in females with a BRCA1 pathogenic variant, although study design issues limit the impact of these findings [Friebel et al 2014].

Oral contraceptive use has been associated with a reduction in ovarian cancer risk of 14% among women who had ever used oral contraceptives and 38% among long-term users [Whittemore et al 2004a].

Note: There is no evidence that use of current (after 1975) oral contraceptive formulations increases the risk for early-onset breast cancer for women with a germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variant.
