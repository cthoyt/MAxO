Preventive measures for individuals known to be susceptible to MH or for any individual with an equivocal contracture test response (MHE) (treated clinically as MHS):

For any individual undergoing anesthesia, obtain a thorough anesthetic history to determine the possibility of the individual or a family member having experienced an MH episode. When suspicion of MHS exists, family members should not be given trigger anesthetic agents, i.e., potent volatile anesthetic agents such as halothane, sevoflurane, desflurane, enflurane, and isoflurane or the depolarizing agent succinylcholine.

In general, individuals undergoing general anesthetics that exceed 30 minutes in duration should have their temperature monitored using an electronic temperature probe. Skin liquid crystal temperature sensors are not recommended as they have been found to be unreliable indicators of changing temperature during human malignant hyperthermia (MH) events.

Individuals with any form of myotonia (see Differential Diagnosis) should not receive succinylcholine.

Individuals with central core disease, multiminicore disease, nemaline myopathy, congenital fiber-type disproportion, or Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy should not receive trigger anesthetics.

Individuals with MHS should carry proper identification as to their susceptibility; identification bracelets are available through the Medic Alert Foundation, Turlock, California (www.medicalert.org).
