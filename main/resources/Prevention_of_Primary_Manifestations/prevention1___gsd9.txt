Liver PhK Deficiency

Hypoglycemia. Frequent feedings high in complex carbohydrates and protein are given to prevent hypoglycemia. In some individuals, no additional treatment is required to prevent hypoglycemia. However, some persons with liver PhK deficiency have severe and recurrent hypoglycemia which can be prevented by ingestion of uncooked cornstarch (range of cornstarch dose 0.6 to 2.5 g/kg) one to four times per day, depending on the severity of the condition. Some individuals may require cornstarch only before bedtime. Requirements for cornstarch tend to lessen with age.

Muscle PhK Deficiency

Little published information is available on prevention of primary manifestations in individuals with muscle PhK deficiency; however, regular moderate aerobic exercise may be beneficial. Intense exercise should be avoided as it may promote rhabdomyolysis and muscle cramping.
