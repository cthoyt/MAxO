MT-RNR1-related aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity. Physicians can inquire about a family history of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss prior to the administration of aminoglycosides, either systemically or locally (e.g., into the cochlea as treatment for Meniere disease). In individuals with a positive family history, alternatives to aminoglycoside treatment should be considered when possible.

In the US, aminoglycoside use is most common in the neonatal intensive care unit; however, the therapeutic imperative of treatment with antibiotics in a neonatal intensive care unit setting does not always lend itself to pre-treatment screening by molecular genetic testing.

Bitner-Glindzicz et al [2009] report a population frequency of 0.19% for the A to G change in a European cohort of children age seven to nine years who had the pathogenic variant but did not have hearing loss because they were not exposed to aminoglycosides; they make an argument for screening on demand to avoid a preventable cause of hearing loss.

In a recent commentary by Boles & Friedlich [2010], the authors suggest a prospective study into the feasibility of screening for these mitochondrial pathogenic variants (especially in busy neonatal units) in order to identify a preventable form of hearing loss.

In the Tianjin Province in China, screening of 58,000 newborns with both audiologic and genetic methods determined that 1.8% of newborns had a pathogenic mitochondrial DNA variant and only one had hearing loss [Zhang et al 2013].
