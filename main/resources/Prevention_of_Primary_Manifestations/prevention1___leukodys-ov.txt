Primary disease manifestations can be prevented in a few of the leukodystrophies: in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, Krabbe disease, and metachromatic leukodystrophy, for example, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) may be beneficial if performed early in the disease course. Patients with these disorders should be referred to specialized centers for consideration of HSCT or BMT [Eichler et al 2009].
