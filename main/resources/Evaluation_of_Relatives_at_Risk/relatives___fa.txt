It is appropriate to evaluate all sibs of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from appropriate monitoring for physical abnormalities, bone marrow failure, and related cancers.

DEB/MMC testing can be used to clarify the disease status of at-risk sibs.

If the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy is possible in females with FA, whether or not they have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [Dalle et al 2004, Nabhan et al 2010].

Pregnancy needs to be managed by a high-risk maternal fetal obstetrician along with a hematologist.
