If the pathogenic variants in a family are known, molecular genetic testing may be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk infants so that those who are affected can be monitored to avoid:

Hyperpyrexia and its potential complications, including febrile seizures;

Injuries to the tongue, lips, and teeth when the primary teeth erupt.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known, monitor the body temperature of at-risk infants during the neonatal period (i.e., first 28 days of life).

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
