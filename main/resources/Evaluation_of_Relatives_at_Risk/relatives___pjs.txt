It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is known, it is appropriate to offer molecular genetic testing for the known pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant to at-risk relatives. Morbidity and mortality can be reduced in those individuals identified to have the family-specific variant by means of:

Early diagnosis and treatment;

Surveillance as outlined in Surveillance.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, it is appropriate to offer:

Clinical diagnostic evaluations to identify those family members who will benefit from early treatment;

Surveillance as outlined in Surveillance to all first-degree relatives whether or not they meet diagnostic criteria.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
