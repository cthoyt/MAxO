Given the risk for vascular disease in neurologically asymptomatic individuals, it is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, head MRI can be used to clarify the disease status of at-risk relatives.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Ideally, women should seek information prior to conception regarding risks to the fetus associated with taking an anti-seizure medication during pregnancy so that changes in the anti-seizure medication regimen (if needed) can be made prior to conception. If not done prior to conception, discussion of the risks and benefits of anti-seizure medication use during pregnancy should occur as soon as the pregnancy is recognized. The teratogenic risk to the fetus associated with the use of anti-seizure medication during pregnancy depends on the type of anti-seizure medication used, the dose, and the gestational age of the fetus.

Currently no guidelines exist on the most appropriate surveillance for and management of cardiac, vascular, and connective tissue problems during pregnancy in women with PVNH. See Marfan Syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Classic Type for possible pregnancy management recommendations.
