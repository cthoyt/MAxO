Using molecular genetic testing for the HOGA1 pathogenic variants found in the proband, it is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early treatment and preventive measures.

Urine oxalate should be measured in all sibs who are affected (i.e., have biallelic HOGA1 pathogenic variants) or who are carriers (i.e., heterozygous for one HOGA1 pathogenic variant)

Any sib with elevated urine oxalate/creatinine ratio or elevated oxalate excretion rate corrected for 1.73 m2 BSA should undergo kidney ultrasound examination, measurement of plasma oxalate concentration, a baseline 24-hour urine collection with a supersaturation profile, and measurement of serum creatinine concentration (see Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis).

See Genetic Counselling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

There have been no studies of pregnancy in women with PH3. However, most women with PH1 or PH2 who had good kidney function during pregnancy have done well and have delivered healthy infants [Norby & Milliner 2004].

Adequate fluid intake should be maintained throughout the pregnancy. Circumstances that compromise fluid intake, such as hyperemesis gravidarum, should prompt early initiation of IV fluid to maintain adequate hydration.

Stones that become symptomatic during pregnancy may require routine (but specialized) techniques for management.

In patients with stones, urinary tract infections should be treated promptly and thoroughly due to the potential for bacteria to cause pyelonephritis or infect stones and complicate management.
