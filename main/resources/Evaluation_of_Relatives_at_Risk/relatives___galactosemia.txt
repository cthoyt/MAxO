When the pathogenic variants causing classic galactosemia or clinical variant galactosemia in the family are known, prenatal diagnosis of fetuses at risk may be performed via amniocentesis or CVS to allow for institution of treatment at birth.

If prenatal testing has not been performed, each at-risk newborn sib should be treated from birth and screened for classic galactosemia or clinical variant galactosemia using the erythrocyte GALT enzyme assay and/or genetic testing (if the familial pathogenic variants in the family are known) to allow for earliest possible diagnosis. Note: If there are concerns about the reliability of the prenatal testing, soy-based formula may be given while the diagnostic testing is being performed.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Both women with classic galactosemia and with clinical variant galactosemia should be on a lactose restricted diet during pregnancy.

There is no evidence that the outcome of children with classic galactosemia or clinical variant galactosemia is improved when their mothers (who are obligate carriers) were on a lactose-restricted diet during pregnancy. Therefore, unaffected pregnant women who are heterozygous for a pathogenic variant in GALT (carrier females) do NOT require a lactose-restricted diet during pregnancy.
