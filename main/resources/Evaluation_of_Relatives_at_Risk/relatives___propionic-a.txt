Testing of at-risk sibs is warranted to allow for early diagnosis and treatment. If prenatal testing has not been performed on at-risk sibs, measure urine organic acids, plasma amino acids, and acylcarnitine profile immediately in the newborn period in parallel with newborn screening.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Although successful pregnancy outcomes have been reported in patients with PA [Van Calcar et al 1992, Langendonk et al 2012], pregnancy can pose a significant management challenge. Hyperemesis gravidarum may require the use of an antiemetic but the risk of QT interval prolongation and the effect on the central nervous system need to be considered [Baumgartner et al 2014]. Baseline evaluation and monitoring of cardiomyopathy before, during, and after pregnancy is recommended. Reference ranges for total and free plasma carnitine differ during pregnancy [Schoderbeck et al 1995]. Close nutritional follow up and fetal growth monitoring is necessary as the energy and protein requirements change throughout pregnancy. Close post-partum clinical and biochemical follow up and delayed discharge from the hospital are recommended. In the post-partum period, increased caloric and protein needs during lactation should be taken into consideration.
