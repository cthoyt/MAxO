It is appropriate to perform laboratory evaluation of the phenotype (CBC and reticulocyte count, blood smear, osmotic fragility or ektacytometry) and clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of an affected individual by molecular genetic testing of the EPB42 pathogenic variants in the family in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

Neonates require monitoring of serum bilirubin concentration during the first week of life so that treatment for hyperbilirubinemia can be instituted promptly to avoid complications such as kernicterus.

Infants require monitoring in the first two to four months of life for significant anemia, which may require RBC transfusion and initiation of folate supplementation

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Folic acid supplementation (800-1000 Âµg daily) is necessary in pregnant women with chronic hemolytic anemias such as EPB42-HS.

Monitoring for exacerbation of anemia with CBC and reticulocyte count is recommended in pregnant women with HS, as hemolytic crisis and persistent anemia have been reported during pregnancy, especially in women who have not undergone splenectomy [Pajor et al 1993].
