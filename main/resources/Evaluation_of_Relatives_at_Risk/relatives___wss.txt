Molecular genetic testing for known familial DCAF17 pathogenic variants is appropriate for the evaluation of apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who will benefit from early identification and treatment of potential complications.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
