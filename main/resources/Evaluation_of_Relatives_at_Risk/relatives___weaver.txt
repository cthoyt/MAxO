Pregnancy Management

In general, pregnancies in which the mother and/or fetus has a heterozygous EZH2 pathogenic variant are uncomplicated. Families and their health care providers should be aware that an affected baby may be large so that appropriate delivery plans can be made; in addition, information about the EZH2-related overgrowth phenotype should be provided.
