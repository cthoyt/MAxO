If the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, molecular genetic testing of at-risk relatives is appropriate because:

ECG changes have low sensitivity in establishing the diagnosis [Priori et al 2003];

Identification of individuals at risk allows preventive measures such as avoidance of medications that can induce ventricular arrhythmias;

Surveillance can then be limited to family members who have the identified pathogenic variant [Benito et al 2009, Esc√°rcega et al 2009, Nunn et al 2010].

If the pathogenic variant has not been identified in the family, relatives should be screened with an ECG. If a type I ECG is identified, further investigation is warranted.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Hormonal changes during pregnancy can precipitate arrhythmic events in women with Brugada syndrome. Recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmia can be inhibited and the electrocardiographic pattern can normalize following IV infusion of low-dose isoproterenol followed by oral quinidine [Sharif-Kazemi et al 2011].

Quinidine is not known to be teratogenic to the developing fetus and is a preferred drug to treat arrhythmia in pregnancy. For more information about medication use during pregnancy, visit www.mothertobaby.org.
