Consideration should be given to testing asymptomatic at-risk family members in order to plan early treatment, monitoring, and preventive intervention [Cochat et al 2012]. If the AGXT pathogenic variants in the family are known, the affected/carrier status of at-risk family members can be confirmed by molecular genetic testing. The benefits of early initiation of conservative measures cannot be ignored [Chand & Kaskel 2009, Fargue et al 2009, Mart√≠n et al 2011].

Asymptomatic individuals:

Can be monitored periodically for renal function and urinary oxalate;

Should maintain adequate hydration and avoid high-oxalate foods.

In addition:

Potassium citrate administration may also be considered as an aid to reducing calcium oxalate excretion [Leumann & Hoppe 2001].

For those with the pathogenic variant p.Gly170Arg or p.Phe152Ile, pyridoxine should be supplemented.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy does not appear to be an important risk factor for the development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the majority of women with PH1 [Norby & Milliner 2004]; however, women in whom renal function deteriorated during the pregnancy and remained abnormal post-delivery have been reported [Cimino et al 2005].

Of particular note, pregnant women with PH1 warrant close monitoring during pregnancy by both an obstetrician and nephrologist because of the increased risk of developing nephrolithiasis after delivery.
