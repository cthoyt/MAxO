A newborn with an older sib with biotinidase deficiency should be treated at birth with biotin pending results of the definitive biotinidase enzyme activity assay and/or molecular genetic testing (if the BTD pathogenic variants in the family are known).

The genetic status of older sibs (even if asymptomatic) of a child with biotinidase deficiency should be clarified by assay of biotinidase enzyme activity or molecular genetic testing (if the BTD pathogenic variants in the family are known) so that biotin therapy can be instituted in a timely manner.

The genetic status of any relative with symptoms consistent with biotinidase deficiency should be clarified by assay of biotinidase enzyme activity or molecular genetic testing (if the BTD pathogenic variants in the family are known) so that biotin therapy can be instituted in a timely manner.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

The only special pregnancy management considerations for a woman who is carrying a baby with biotinidase deficiency or is at risk of having a baby with biotinidase deficiency is consideration of biotin supplementation of the mother. An optimal prenatal dose has not been determined.
