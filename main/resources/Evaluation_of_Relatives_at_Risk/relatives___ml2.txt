Pregnancy Management

Since individuals with ML II do not survive into adulthood, there have not been any reports of affected individuals who have become pregnant.

In women who have a fetus diagnosed prenatally with ML II, the fetus should be carefully monitored for intrauterine growth retardation and skeletal changes such as extraosseous calcifications and/or osteolytic lesions. Ultrasound abnormalities are not present in all affected pregnancies.
