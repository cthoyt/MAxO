Pregnancy Management

Reports addressing pregnancy management in women with VPS35-PD are not available. The effect of PD in general on pregnancy has not been well characterized, since pregnancy is uncommon in women with PD. While most reports indicate that disease manifestations worsen during pregnancy, improvement has also been described (for a review see Robottom et al [2008], Kranick et al [2010]).

No long-term outcome data exist for children born to mothers with Parkinson disease.

Levodopa crosses the placenta and some animal models have shown that high doses of levodopa administered during pregnancy may induce skeletal and visceral malformations; however, in more than 30 cases reported in the literature, levodopa treatment during human pregnancy did not result in adverse fetal outcome [Scott & Chowdhury 2005].

Amantadine should be avoided during pregnancy, if possible, since adverse pregnancy outcomes have been reported in rats.

Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given medication during pregnancy should ideally take place prior to conception. See MotherToBaby to access further information on medication use during pregnancy.
