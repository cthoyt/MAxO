Parents and older and younger at-risk sibs of a proband should be tested for the 3q29 recurrent deletion. Parents or sibs may have the deletion, but with only mild or nonexistent developmental delay or intellectual disability. The average age at onset for schizophrenia is 20-25 years; thus, mildly affected individuals remain at risk for neuropsychiatric manifestations and would benefit from monitoring and clinical evaluation.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
