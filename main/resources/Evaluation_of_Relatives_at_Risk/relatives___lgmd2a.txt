It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual by molecular genetic testing of the CAPN3 pathogenic variant in the family in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of evaluation and subsequent surveillance. With the associated intrafamilial phenotype variability, the possibility of calpainopathy should not be excluded in sibs on the basis of absence of symptoms alone.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Women with calpainopathy do not have impaired uterine smooth muscle strength or function and typically have uncomplicated pregnancies. A higher incidence of abnormal fetal presentation was reported in wheelchair-bound individuals with LGMD [Awater et al 2012]. Epidural blockade can be difficult in those with severe spine deformities and appropriate general anaesthesia may be necessary. About half of persons with LGMD reported deterioration of clinical symptoms in pregnancy [Awater et al 2012].
