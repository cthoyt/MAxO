It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual by molecular genetic testing for the BAP1 pathogenic variant in the family in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of screening and preventive measures.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
