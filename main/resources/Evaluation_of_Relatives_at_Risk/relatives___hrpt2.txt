If the family-specific CDC73 germline pathogenic variant has been identified, molecular genetic testing should be offered to at-risk relatives starting around age five to ten years in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and/or preventive measures.

When molecular testing for a CDC73 pathogenic variant is not possible or not informative, individuals at 50% risk (first-degree relatives of an individual with CDC73-related disorders) should undergo routine evaluation for primary hyperparathyroidism (see Surveillance).

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Primary hyperparathyroidism during pregnancy may pose increased risks to the mother (symptomatic hypercalcemia) and to the fetus (intrauterine growth retardation, preterm delivery, intrauterine fetal demise, and/or postpartum neonatal hypocalcemia). Conservative observation may be appropriate for mild asymptomatic hypercalcemia, but for symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism or evidence of adverse effects on the fetus, surgery (preferred in the second trimester) is required for definitive treatment. These women should be managed in conjunction with a maternal-fetal medicine specialist.
