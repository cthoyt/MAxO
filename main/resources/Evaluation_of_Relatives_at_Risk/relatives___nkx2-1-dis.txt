Evaluation of at-risk relatives prenatally or as soon as possible after birth enables early identification of infants at high risk for congenital hypothyroidism and pulmonary disease, permitting early diagnosis and management, and particularly, prevention of the neurodevelopmental consequences of untreated hypothyroidism.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the NKX2-1 pathogenic variant in the family is known;

If a pathogenic variant has not been identified, assessment of thyroid function in a family with benign hereditary chorea or brain-lung-thyroid syndrome.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

There is no known increased risk during pregnancy for a woman with an NKX2-1-related disorder.

Prior to pregnancy or early in gestation, it is recommended that a woman work with her physician to determine the safety for the fetus of the use of any medication she is taking for chorea.
