It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of at-risk asymptomatic sibs of a proband for citrin deficiency so that appropriate dietary management of infants (discontinuation of breast feeding and introduction of lactose-free and/or MCT-enriched formulas) can be instituted before symptoms occur.

Because asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals with citrin deficiency do not always show biochemical abnormalities, definitive diagnosis of at-risk relatives (e.g., sibs) would depend heavily on SLC25A13 molecular genetic findings in the proband:

If both SLC25A13 pathogenic variants in the index case have been identified, molecular genetic testing can be used reliably.

If only one SLC25A13 pathogenic variant is ascertained in the index case, it may not be feasible to definitively exclude the diagnosis in at-risk relatives who have the one identified pathogenic variant. In such cases, serial clinical and biochemical assessment will be needed over time to confirm or rule out the diagnosis.

If no SLC25A13 pathogenic variant is ascertained in the index case, molecular testing of at-risk individuals will not be helpful. In such cases, serial clinical and biochemical assessment will be needed over time to confirm or rule out the diagnosis

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
