Using the strategy outlined in Evaluation of First-Degree Relatives of a Proband for Dilated Cardiomyopathy, it is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from surveillance and preventive measures.

When the pathogenic variant(s) are known, relatives may be offered genetic testing to help clarify risk. However, the absence of a likely pathogenic variant in an unaffected relative should be interpreted with caution, as it is possible that some families may have two or more pathogenic variants.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

In most cases, pregnancy is contraindicated in DCM.

Pregnant women with IDC or FDC should be followed by a high-risk obstetrician.

Asymptomatic women with a family history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy may be at risk for peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) and pregnancy-associated cardiomyopathy (PACM). Although PPCM and PACM have traditionally been thought to have an etiology separate from familial dilated cardiomyopathy, evidence supporting a genetic basis is emerging [Elkayam et al 2005, Morales et al 2010, van Spaendonck-Zwarts et al 2010]. Healthcare providers must, therefore, be aware of the possibility of an underlying genetic cause for PPCM/PACM and follow guidelines for the evaluation of DCM (see Evaluation Strategy). Reproductive genetic counseling and genetic testing should be considered in these cases.
