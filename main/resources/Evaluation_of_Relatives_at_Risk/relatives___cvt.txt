Because treatment and surveillance are available to reduce morbidity and mortality, first-degree relatives should be offered clinical work up and molecular genetic testing if the family-specific pathogenic allelic variant(s) are known. Indeed, the availability of effective preventive therapies can reduce the number of fatal arrhythmic events if individuals with pathogenic variants are diagnosed early.

If the family-specific pathogenic variant(s) are not known, all first-degree relatives of an affected individual should be evaluated with resting ECG, Holter monitoring, and – most importantly – exercise stress testing.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Beta-blockers (preferentially nadolol or propranolol) should be administered throughout pregnancy in affected women.
