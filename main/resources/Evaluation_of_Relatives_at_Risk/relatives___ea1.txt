It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic relatives at risk in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from behavioral measures and avoidance of caffeine intake. If the pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

No published literature addresses management of the pregnancy of an affected mother or the effect of maternal EA1 on a fetus. However, affected women should be made aware that pregnancy may trigger attacks [Graves et al 2014] and the possible loss of balance and fall could endanger the fetusâ€™s life. Moreover, several stressors that trigger attacks may cause breathing difficulties, thus, delivery by C-section should be considered.
