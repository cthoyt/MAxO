It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures. Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known;

Urinary steroid profiling using gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GC/MS) can be done if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known. The characteristic urinary steroid profile:

Increased coancentration of metabolites of pregnenolone (pregnenediol) and progesterone (pregnanediol)

Significantly elevated metabolites associated with:

Deficiency of 17α-hydroxylase (5 α-tetrahydrocorticosterone, tetrahydrocorticosterone, and 11 dehydrometabolites)

Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase (17 α-hydroxypregnanolone, pregnanetriol, and pregnanetriolone)

Pregnancy Management

Fertility may be a concern. No reports describe reproduction in individuals with PORD; thus, the prevalence of infertility among individuals with PORD remains uncertain.

Hepatic drug metabolism. NADPH--cytochrome P450 reductase (POR) plays an important role in the metabolism of various drugs and endogenous metabolites/hormones by hepatic microsomal (type 2) P450 cytochromes. Initial studies using bacterially expressed POR pathogenic variants and two hepatic P450 enzymes suggest that pathogenic variants in POR may alter drug metabolism [Miller et al 2009]. In these studies different pathogenic variants resulted in different effects, ranging from no apparent activity to elevated activity of the hepatic P450 enzymes; these activities were not correlated with their activity in CYP17A1 assays.

In vitro activity assays on major drug-metabolizing enzymes and in vivo investigations to assess the impact of various pathogenic and non-pathogenic variants of POR have been performed by various groups [Agrawal et al 2008, Hart & Zhong 2008, Kranendonk et al 2008, Gomes et al 2009, Oneda et al 2009, Agrawal et al 2010, Flück et al 2010, Tomalik-Scharte et al 2010]. For comprehensive reviews on the pharmacogenetics of POR see Pandey & Sproll [2014] and Burkhard et al [2017].

In brief, the different pathogenic variations have different effects on microsomal P450 drug metabolizing enzymes. The common pathogenic variant p.Ala287Pro reduces the activity of the major P450 cytochrome CYP3A4 (which metabolizes ~50% of clinically used drugs) by more than 75% [Nicolo et al 2010]. In vivo cocktail phenotyping in an individual homozygous for the p.Ala287Pro pathogenic variant confirmed altered hepatic detoxification of a variety of drugs due to impaired activity of various hepatic CYP enzymes, including CYP3A4, CYP1A1, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6; the heterozygous mother of this individual also showed impaired activities of CYP1A1 and CYP2C9 [Tomalik-Scharte et al 2010]. In addition, in vitro assays suggest that some variants cause a substrate-specific modulation of CYP3A4 [Agrawal et al 2010].
