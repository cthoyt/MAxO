Pregnancy Management

Data on the use of the oral medications typically used for treatment of dystonia during pregnancy are limited. Isolated case reports of treatment with trihexyphenidyl or carbidopa/levodopa for various conditions (including certain forms of dystonia) during pregnancy have not found adverse effects on either the affected mother or the fetus [Watanabe et al 2009, Mendhekar & Andrade 2011, Robottom & Reich 2011, Serikawa et al 2011, Watanabe & Matsubara 2012, Dostal et al 2013].

No adverse fetal or maternal outcomes were reported in two series of women, including four women with DYT1 dystonia, who were treated with DBS implantation prior to pregnancy. [Scelzo et al 2015, Ziman et al 2016].
