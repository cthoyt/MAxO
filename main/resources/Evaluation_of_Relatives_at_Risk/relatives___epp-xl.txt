If the ALAS2 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, at-risk relatives can be tested as newborns or infants so that those with the pathogenic variant can benefit from early intervention (sun protection) and future monitoring for signs of liver dysfunction.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

There is no information on pregnancy management in XLP. Based on experience with EPP pregnancy is unlikely to be complicated by XLP [Poh-Fitzpatrick 1997].
