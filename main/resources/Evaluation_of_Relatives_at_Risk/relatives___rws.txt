Presymptomatic diagnosis of at-risk relatives followed by treatment is necessary to prevent syncope and sudden death in those individuals who have inherited the pathogenic variant and/or have ECG findings consistent with LQTS. At-risk family members should be alerted to their risk and the need to be evaluated.

Relatives at high potential risk for LQTS who require further testing include members of a family:

That has documented LQTS;

In which evaluation for LQTS has not been performed.

Presymptomatic diagnosis for at-risk asymptomatic family members can be performed by one

or both of the following:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant in the family is known

If the pathogenic variant is not known or if genetic testing is not possible, QTc analysis on resting and in case of normal QTc also QTc analysis on exercise ECGsNote: The diagnostic accuracy by QTc analysis is considerably improved by evaluation of the exercise ECG QTc intervals, in addition to the resting ECG, using the QTc values listed in Table 1.

Relatives at low potential risk who do not require further testing include members of a family in which the connecting ancestor:

Has a low probability of LQTS based on QTc interval (see Table 1) and has not experienced LQTS-type events; or

Has a normal QTc interval and no evidence of a pathogenic variant in one of the genes known to cause LQTS; or

Does not have the family-specific pathogenic variant, if known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

The post-partum period is associated with increased risk for a cardiac event, especially in individuals with the LQTS type 2 phenotype. Beta blocker treatment was associated with a reduction of events in this nine-month time period after delivery [Seth et al 2007].
