It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of a proband/in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known;

High-resolution renal and hepatic ultrasonographic evaluation and monitoring of systemic blood pressure if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
