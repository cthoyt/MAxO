It is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

If the CTDP1 pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known careful monitoring of at-risk sibs for the early disease manifestations (ocular, delayed motor milestones, early signs of peripheral neuropathy) will ensure timely diagnosis of those affected.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Experience is very limited, as only three females with CCFDN are known to have given birth [Tournev et al 2001, Walter et al 2014]. The pregnancies are reported as uneventful and were carried to term. Normal pregnancy and delivery have also been reported by mothers of children with CCFDN.
