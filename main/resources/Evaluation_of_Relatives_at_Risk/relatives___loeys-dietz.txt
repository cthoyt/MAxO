If the causal TGFBR1,

TGFBR2, SMAD3, or TGFB2 pathogenic variant is identified in the proband, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify genetic status of family members at risk to identify those individuals who need regular cardiovascular follow-up screening to detect aortic aneurysm early and initiate appropriate medical or surgical intervention.

If the causal pathogenic variant is not known, relatives at risk should be evaluated for signs of the disorder. Echocardiography and extensive vascular imaging of relatives is indicated upon appreciation of any suspicious signs of LDS, and even in apparently unaffected individuals if findings are subtle in the index case.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancy can be dangerous for women with LDS. Complications include aortic dissection/rupture or uterine rupture during pregnancy or delivery, or aortic dissection/rupture in the immediate postpartum period. Increased frequency of aortic imaging is recommended, both during pregnancy and in the weeks following delivery. However, with appropriate supervision and high-risk obstetrical management, women with Loeys-Dietz syndrome can tolerate pregnancy and delivery [Gutman et al 2009].
