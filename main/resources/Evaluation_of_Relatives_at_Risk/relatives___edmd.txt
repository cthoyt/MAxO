It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic at-risk sibs, parents, and relatives of individuals with EDMD because of the high risk for cardiac complications (including sudden death) associated with LMNA, EMD, and FLH1 pathogenic variants. Evaluation may allow early identification of family members who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures [Manilal et al 1998, BÃ©cane et al 2000, Canki-Klain et al 2000, Vytopil et al 2002, Boriani et al 2003, Taylor et al 2003, Gueneau et al 2009, Knoblauch et al 2010, Jimenez-Escrig et al 2012]. Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the LMNA, EMD, or FHL1 pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known;

Cardiac evaluation if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

In a woman with EDMD, pregnancy complications may include the development of cardiomyopathy or progression of preexisting cardiomyopathy, preterm delivery, respiratory involvement, cephalopelvic disproportion, and delivery of a low birth-weight infant. Pregnancy management is challenging, with very limited literature addressing the issue. Caesarean section delivery may be required. Referral of an affected pregnant woman to a specialized obstetric unit in close collaboration with a cardiologist is recommended for optimal pregnancy outcome.
