The molecular genetic test method used to evaluate parents, children, and at-risk sibs of individuals with CCHS depends on the pathogenic variant identified in the proband (see Testing Strategy). Parents of children with a known PHOX2B variant should be tested for the family-specific variant to determine their risk for later-onset CCHS or mosaicism.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Though not prospectively evaluated, the ventilatory needs of a pregnant woman with CCHS warrant careful consideration by the obstetrician.
