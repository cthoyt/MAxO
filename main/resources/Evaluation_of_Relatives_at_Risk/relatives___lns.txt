Prenatal testing or testing of males at risk for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome immediately after birth enables prompt initiation of allopurinol therapy.

Some carrier females develop gout in later years; thus, establishing carrier status of female relatives through genetic testing may be valuable to their clinical management.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
