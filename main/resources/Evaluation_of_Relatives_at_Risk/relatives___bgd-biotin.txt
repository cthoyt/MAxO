If the pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, perform molecular genetic testing on at-risk relatives (e.g., sibs of the proband) in order to begin biotin and thiamine therapy as soon as possible in all individuals with biallelic SLC19A3 pathogenic variants, even those who are asymptomatic.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Affected women should continue biotin and thiamine therapy during pregnancy. No information regarding risk to the fetus of an affected mother is available.
