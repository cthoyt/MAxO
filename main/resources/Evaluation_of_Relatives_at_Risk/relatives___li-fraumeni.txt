Once a TP53 pathogenic variant has been identified in a family, testing of at-risk relatives can identify those family members who also have the familial pathogenic variant and thus need increased surveillance and early intervention when a cancer is identified. However, families with LFS need to be cautioned that currently no definitive evidence demonstrates a benefit for increased surveillance or early intervention.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Women with LFS who are pregnant should bring any potential symptoms of cancer to the attention of their physicians. Women with LFS who are pregnant can continue to have clinical breast exams and/or breast imaging studies if indicated.

There are no special recommendations for screening a fetus identified as having a germlineTP53 pathogenic variant. Once the infant is born, he or she can be evaluated for signs of cancer.
