It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of a proband/at-risk relatives in order to identify as early as possible those who should be referred to a cystic fibrosis center for initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known;

Sweat chloride testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Pregnancies are well tolerated with improved nutrition, improved pulmonary treatment, aggressive management of infections, and a multidisciplinary care team, especially in women with mild to moderate disease. Pregnancy is not associated with an increased risk of death [Goss et al 2003]. In all studies published to date, the most important predictors of pregnancy outcome are the severity of maternal pulmonary impairment and nutritional status; deterioration during pregnancy may precipitate preterm delivery.

Females with CF of reproductive age should receive preconception counseling and take steps to optimize health prior to pregnancy.

The management of pregnancy and the immediate post-partum period for a woman with CF requires a dietician, members of the CF team, and a maternal fetal medicine specialist.

Maternal nutritional status and weight gain should be monitored and optimized aggressively and pulmonary exacerbations should be treated early.

Traditional screening paradigms for gestational diabetes mellitus may not be useful in pregnancies of women with CF; therefore, screening at each trimester of pregnancy has been suggested to improve the detection of diabetes mellitus.

As in pregnancies of women with other forms of diabetes mellitus, fetal outcome is optimized when glycemic control is achieved prior to pregnancy.

Mode of delivery is based on usual obstetric indications.
