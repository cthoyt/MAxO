Using molecular genetic testing for the GRIN2A pathogenic variant found in an affected family member, it is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic at-risk relatives in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from institution of treatment. Of note, some individuals heterozygous for a GRIN2A pathogenic variant who have only relatively mild speech dysfunction may benefit from early evaluation and intervention by a speech and language pathologist.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
