Determining in infancy or early childhood whether a relative of a person with DFNA2 nonsyndromic hearing loss has inherited the KCNQ4 deafness-related variant allows for early support and management of the child and the family.

Evaluations may include:

Molecular genetic testing if the deafness-related KCNQ4 variant in the family is known.

Audiometry and sequence analysis of KCNQ4, or a multi-gene panel [Kothiyal et al 2010, Shearer et al 2010, Shearer & Smith 2015] that includes KCNQ4 if the deafness-related variant in the family is not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
