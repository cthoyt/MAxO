Once a cancer-predisposing BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline variant has been identified in a family, testing of at-risk relatives can identify those family members who also have the familial variant and thus need increased surveillance and early intervention when a cancer is identified.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
