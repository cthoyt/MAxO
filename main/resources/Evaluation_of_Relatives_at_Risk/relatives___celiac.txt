Molecular genetic testing of first-degree relatives of individuals with celiac disease can identify those who are susceptible to developing celiac disease and who would benefit from serologic testing to screen for celiac disease or silent celiac disease. Of note, first-degree relatives do not need to be symptomatic to consider molecular genetic testing. (See Testing Strategies, In a Symptomatic Individual who is on a Gluten-Free Diet, Molecular genetic testing.)

Early diagnosis of celiac disease and treatment with a gluten-free diet can prevent secondary complications.

Individuals who do not have the celiac disease-associated HLA alleles DQ2 and DQ8 do not need to undergo serologic screening for celiac disease.

Individuals who have celiac disease-associated HLA alleles (Table 3) are followed by celiac disease-associated antibody testing at three- to five-year intervals.

Small-bowel biopsy is recommended when celiac disease-associated antibody testing is positive.

A definitive diagnosis of celiac disease is made in a person with a positive small-bowel biopsy and clinical and/or histologic improvement on a gluten-free diet.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
