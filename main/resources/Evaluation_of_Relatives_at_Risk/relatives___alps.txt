It is appropriate to perform molecular genetic testing on relatives at risk for ALPS-FAS, ALPS-FASLG, or ALPS-CASP10 if the pathogenic variant has been identified in the proband.

Relatives who have the family-specific pathogenic variant should:

Be advised of their increased risk for ALPS if the type and location of the ALPS-related pathogenic variant is predicted to have a high penetrance for clinical ALPS;

Undergo ALPS-specific evaluations at initial diagnosis (e.g., enumeration of α/β-DNT cells, detection of autoantibodies, IL-10/soluble FasL measurement) (see Evaluations Following Initial Diagnosis);

Be advised that ALPS-specific evaluations or other assessments may need to be repeated at regular intervals, particularly if the family member is young and/or if new health-related issues consistent with ALPS or ALPS-related complications (e.g., lymphoma) become apparent (see Surveillance).

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

In addition to the risks and benefits to a woman with ALPS associated with treatment with corticosteroids, mycophenylate mofitil, or sirolimus during pregnancy, the potential teratogenic risks of these exposures to the fetus must also be weighed.

See MotherToBaby for further information on medication use during pregnancy.
