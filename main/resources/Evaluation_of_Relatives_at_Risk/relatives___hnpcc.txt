Early recognition of cancers associated with Lynch syndrome may allow for timely intervention and improved final outcome; thus, surveillance of asymptomatic at-risk relatives for early manifestations is appropriate.

When an MMR pathogenic variant has been identified in a family with Lynch syndrome, molecular genetic testing for the pathogenic variant should be offered to all first-degree relatives (parents, sibs, and children).

The sibs should be considered at risk even if the parents have not had cancer because most Lynch syndrome results from an inherited (not de novo) pathogenic variant.

If clinical history and family history cannot identify the parent from whom the proband inherited the MMR gene pathogenic variant, molecular genetic testing for the pathogenic variant should be offered to both parents to determine which has the MMR gene pathogenic variant.

In general, molecular genetic testing for Lynch syndrome is not recommended for at-risk individuals younger than age 18 years. However, because cancer has been diagnosed in individuals with Lynch syndrome at very young ages [Huang et al 2001], it is recommended that screening begin ten years before the earliest age of onset in the family. In such instances, it is appropriate to offer molecular genetic testing to children younger than age 18 years prior to initiating cancer screening.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Ideally cancer screening exams would be planned around a pregnancy. An affected woman would be encouraged to be current on her cancer screening before attempting to become pregnant. If an affected woman is diagnosed with cancer during pregnancy, she should be counseled about cancer treatment options and their potential implications for the fetus.
