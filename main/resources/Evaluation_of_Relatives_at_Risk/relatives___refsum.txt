It is appropriate to evaluate sibs of a proband before symptoms of Refsum disease occur in order to institute early treatment to reduce plasma phytanic acid concentration. Evaluations include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variants in the family are known;

Measurement of phytanic acid concentration in plasma or serum if the pathogenic variants in the family are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Because of the tendency for pregnancy to induce catabolism, it is extremely important to manage plasma phytanic acid concentration during pregnancy in women with Refsum disease.

Fairly rapid reduction of visual fields has been observed during the third trimester of pregnancy [BP Leroy, unpublished observations], possibly due to increased plasma phytanic acid concentration resulting from increased catabolism.
