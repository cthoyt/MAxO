If an OFD1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, it is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic female relatives (even in the absence of oral, facial, and digital anomalies) to determine if they are at risk for renal disease.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Affected pregnant women should undergo careful monitoring of their blood pressure and renal function during pregnancy.
