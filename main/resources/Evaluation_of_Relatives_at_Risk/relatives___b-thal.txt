It is appropriate to evaluate older and younger sibs of a proband as early as possible. Early detection of anemia, the primary manifestation of β-thalassemia, allows prompt, appropriate treatment and monitoring.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known, hematologic testing can be used to clarify the disease status of at-risk sibs.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Provided that a multidisciplinary team is available, pregnancy is possible and safe, and usually has a favorable outcome in women with β-thalassemia. An increasing number of women with thalassemia major and thalassemia intermedia may, therefore, have children. Although hypogonadotropic hypogonadism remains a common condition in thalassemia major, gonadal function is usually intact and fertility is usually retrievable.

Pregnancy also appears to be safe in most women with thalassemia intermedia, although larger and more detailed studies are needed. Indeed, an increased risk for certain complications cannot yet be excluded. For example, women with thalassemia intermedia who had never previously received a blood transfusion or who had received a minimal quantity of blood are reported to be at risk for severe alloimmune anemia if blood transfusions are required during pregnancy [Origa et al 2010].
