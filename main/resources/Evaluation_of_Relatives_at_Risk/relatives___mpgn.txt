If pathogenic variants in CFH have been identified in an affected individual, sibs can be offered molecular genetic testing to identify those who have the same variant(s) in order to facilitate early diagnosis and management of renal disease. Penetrance rates, however, are not known.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
