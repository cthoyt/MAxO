Because the age of onset of arginase deficiency is delayed beyond the newborn period and the manifestations can vary, the genetic status of all sibs of a proband (especially the younger ones) should be clarified so that morbidity can be reduced by early diagnosis and treatment in those who are affected. Testing methods can include any one of the following:

Plasma quantitative amino acid analysis

Molecular genetic testing (if the family-specific ARG1 pathogenic variants are known)

Analysis of enzymatic activity in red blood cells

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

The authors are not aware of any instance in which pregnancy has been reported in a woman with arginase deficiency; therefore, no inference can be drawn about the safety of pregnancy for the mother or the fetus.
