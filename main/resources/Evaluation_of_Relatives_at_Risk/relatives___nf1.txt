Pregnancy Management

Although most pregnancies in women with NF1 are normal, serious complications can occur [Chetty et al 2011, Terry et al 2013].

Many women with NF1 experience a rapid increase in the number and size of neurofibromas during pregnancy.

Hypertension may first become symptomatic or, if preexisting, may be greatly exacerbated during pregnancy.

Large pelvic or genital neurofibromas can complicate delivery, and cesarean section appears to be necessary more often in pregnant women with NF1 than in other women.
