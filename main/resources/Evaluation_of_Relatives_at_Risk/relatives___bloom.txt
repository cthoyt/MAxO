It is appropriate to evaluate sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from avoidance of sun exposure to the face and early surveillance for cancer (see Surveillance).

Molecular genetic testing can be used to evaluate sibs if the BLM pathogenic variants in the family are known.

An unusually low birth weight followed by short stature throughout childhood is typically present in affected sibs; sibs of normal stature are likely unaffected and may not need further testing.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to the testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
