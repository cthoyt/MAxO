It is appropriate to evaluate the older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

If the pathogenic variants in the family are not known:

Sisters of females with MKS should have examination of the external genitalia for vaginal membranes or an imperforate vagina and of the hands and feet for polydactyly, and an echocardiogram for the congenital heart defects associated with MKS.

Brothers of affected females should have an examination of the external genitalia for hypospadias, cryptorchidism, and chordee and of the hands and feet for polydactyly, and an echocardiogram for cardiac manifestations of MKS.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
