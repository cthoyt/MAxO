If both (paternal and maternal) PROP1 pathogenic variants are identified in a proband, it is appropriate to perform molecular genetic testing on younger sibs to enable early diagnosis and treatment.

For younger sibs who have not undergone molecular genetic testing, monitoring growth for evidence of growth failure is appropriate. Of note, affected sibs usually have extreme short stature because of thyroid hormone deficiency and growth hormone deficiency.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
