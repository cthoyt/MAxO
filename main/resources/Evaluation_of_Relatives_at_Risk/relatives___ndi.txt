It is appropriate to test at-risk infants for the family-specific pathogenic variant(s) as early as possible to allow for prompt diagnosis and treatment to reduce morbidity from hypernatremia, dehydration, and dilation of the urinary tract.

Since autosomal dominant NDI is usually less severe than X-linked or autosomal recessive NDI, genetic testing of sibs of affected children may be performed at a later stage.

Asymptomatic female family members of a male with X-linked NDI who are at risk of being a carrier of the pathogenic variant may undergo genetic counseling and genetic testing when they are of reproductive age.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Carriers of X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus may experience a mild increase in urinary output and associated thirst during pregnancy.

No pregnancies in women with NDI resulting from two AQP2 pathogenic variants have been reported to date.

Polyhydramnios is found in a minority of pregnancies in which the fetus is affected by NDI. In cases of severe polyhydramnios and maternal discomfort, frequent amniotic fluid drainage may be necessary [Kollamparambil et al 2011].
