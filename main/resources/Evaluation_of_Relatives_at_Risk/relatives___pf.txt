It is appropriate to evaluate relatives at risk in order to identify as early as

possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is known, molecular genetic

testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives.

If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, simple screening

tests have been found to be sensitive for establishing the diagnosis in

relatives at risk [Watters et al 1986, Hartley et al 1994] and

prognosis of pulmonary fibrosis [Watters et al 1986, Schwartz et al

1994a, Schwartz et al 1994b].

It is recommended that every five years, asymptomatic

first-degree relatives (of individuals with FPF) older than age

50 years undergo pulmonary function tests, obtain an HRCT scan

of the chest to detect early abnormalities, and complete a

standardized questionnaire to assess the presence of respiratory

symptoms.

Family members are considered to have a positive screening

evaluation (i.e., to possibly have pulmonary fibrosis) if they

have at least class 2 dyspnea (breathlessness when hurrying on a

level surface or walking up a slight hill), a DLCO

below 80% of predicted, or presence of at least ILO category 1

findings on chest x-ray [International Labour Office 2011]. Family members

who have a positive screen require further evaluation (see Diagnosis).

A study of asymptomatic at-risk family members in a FPF cohort by Kropski et al

[2015] identified more than 25% of subjects with subtle

radiologic and histopathologic abnormalities suggestive of possible

early interstitial lung disease. It is unknown if these findings would

become symptomatic FPF in the subjects.
