Evaluation of at-risk sibs (either by molecular genetic testing if the family-specific pathogenic variants are known or by biochemical testing) shortly after birth can reduce morbidity by permitting early diagnosis and treatment of those who are affected.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
