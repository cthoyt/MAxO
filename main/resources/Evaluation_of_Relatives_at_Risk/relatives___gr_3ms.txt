Early diagnosis of at-risk sibs allows for early orthopedic evaluation and measures to control the development of arthritis.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Management of pregnancy for affected women is identical to that for women with other forms of dwarfism or small stature, which is mainly to reduce the risk of premature birth.

When a fetus is diagnosed prenatally (usually as the result of molecular genetic testing of an at-risk sib), no special surveillance during the pregnancy is warranted and no special issues regarding delivery have been identified.
