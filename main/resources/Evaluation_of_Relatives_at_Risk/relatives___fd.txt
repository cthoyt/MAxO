Pregnancy Management

Pregnancies in women with FD are considered high risk because of abrupt changes in blood pressure.

High blood pressure secondary to FD is difficult to differentiate from toxemia or other causes of pregnancy-related high blood pressure.

Awareness of volume loss and low blood pressure is important because of the absence of reflex tachycardia to low blood pressure.

Visceral pain related to contractions during labor is perceived normally; therefor, analgesia should be provided. Epidural anesthesia is preferable due to blood pressure lability during general anesthesia or spinal block [Maayan et al 2000].
