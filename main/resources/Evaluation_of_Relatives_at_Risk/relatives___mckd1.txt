For the purpose of early diagnosis and treatment. If the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk relatives (parents, sibs, and offspring). Relatives found to have a pathogenic variant can be monitored with serum creatinine measurements to allow early diagnosis and treatment (see Related Genetic Counseling Issues for discussion of testing of children.)

For the purpose of kidney donation. If an MUC1 pathogenic variant is known to be present in an affected family member, any relative who is a potential kidney donor should undergo molecular genetic testing to clarify his/her genetic status so that only those without the pathogenic variant are evaluated further. Several individuals with what appeared to be clinically normal kidney function have donated kidneys and later been found to have ADTKD, MUC1.Thus, it is important to test even those family members with normal kidney function to be certain that they do not have a pathogenic variant.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
