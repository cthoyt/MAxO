It is appropriate to screen apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives (regardless of gender) of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures.

Evaluations include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant in the family is known;

If the pathogenic variant in the family is not known, measurement of serum urate concentration; 24-hour urinary uric acid excretion or spot urine uric acid/creatinine ratio; and an audiology evaluation. Note: (1) Because collection of 24-hour urine in an infant or young child is very difficult, measurement of uric acid/creatinine ratio in a spot urine sample may be helpful. (2) Sometimes the serum urate concentrations are not extremely elevated in children with PRS superactivity, probably as a result of higher renal clearance of urate, however the urine urate excretion is abnormally high for age in all individuals.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
