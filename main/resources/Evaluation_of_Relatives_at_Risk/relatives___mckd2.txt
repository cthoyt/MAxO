It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic relatives of an affected individual by molecular genetic testing for the familial UMOD pathogenic variant in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures. Particularly important are:

Adolescents because of their increased risk for gout, which can be prevented with allopurinol treatment;

Relatives interested in donating a kidney to an affected family member.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

No pregnancy issues are particular to ADTKD-UMOD. However, in general, chronic kidney disease, depending on the stage, can affect pregnancy through increased hypertension and increased fetal loss.

Women of childbearing age who are taking medications such as allopurinol or an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor should discuss their medication regimen with their physician prior to conception.

A recent study has suggested that allopurinol use during pregnancy may be associated with fetal malformations. While the study included women who were on many other medications when they became pregnant, allopurinol should be discontinued in women who are pregnant or who may become pregnant [Hoeltzenbein et al 2013].

Similarly, the use of ACE inhibitors during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in fetal damage and death. Women who are taking ACE inhibitors prior to pregnancy or at the time of conception should be transitioned to another antihypertensive medication.

Ideally, women should not be taking either allopurinol or an ACE inhibitor during pregnancy.
