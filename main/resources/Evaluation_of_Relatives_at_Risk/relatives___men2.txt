It is appropriate to evaluate apparently asymptomatic at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from initiation of treatment and preventive measures. The American Society of Clinical Oncologists (ASCO) identifies MEN 2 as a Group 1 disorder, i.e., a well-defined hereditary cancer syndrome for which genetic testing is considered part of the standard management for at-risk family members [American Society of Clinical Oncology 2003]. Evaluations can include:

Molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant in the family is known:

MEN 2A.

RET molecular genetic testing should be offered to at-risk children by age five years. The finding of MTC in the thyroid of a 12-month-old with a RET pathogenic variant suggests that molecular genetic testing should be performed even earlier when possible [Machens et al 2004].

FMTC. Recommendations for families with known FMTC are the same as for MEN 2A.

MEN 2B.

RET molecular genetic testing should be performed as soon as possible after birth in all children known to be at risk [Brandi et al 2001].

The following screening of at-risk family members if the pathogenic variant in the family is not known:

Neck ultrasound examination and basal and/or stimulated calcitonin measurements for MTC

Albumin-corrected calcium or ionized calcium for hyperparathyroidism

Measurement of plasma or 24-hour urine metanephrines and normetanephrines as appropriate [American Thyroid Association Guidelines Task Force 2009] for pheochromocytoma

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

Pregnancy Management

Women with MEN 2 should be screened for pheochromocytoma prior to a planned pregnancy, or as early as possible during an unplanned pregnancy [American Thyroid Association Guidelines Task Force 2009].
