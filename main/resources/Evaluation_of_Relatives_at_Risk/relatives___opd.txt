Consider molecular genetic testing for the family-specific mutation in all at-risk relatives

Because affected individuals may benefit from early evaluations for hearing loss and orthopedic complications, including scoliosis, molecular genetic testing for the family-specific mutation in all at-risk relatives should be considered.

If molecular genetic testing is not an option for an at-risk child, evaluations for hearing loss and orthopedic complications, including scoliosis, should be instituted as soon as possible after a clinical diagnosis is established in the at-risk relative.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
