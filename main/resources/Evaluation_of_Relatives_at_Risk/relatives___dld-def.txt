If the DLD pathogenic variants in an affected relative are known, at-risk sibs should undergo molecular genetic testing as soon as possible after birth so that those who have inherited both pathogenic variants can receive appropriate treatment and avoid risk factors that may precipitate an acute event. In some instances, families choose to perform prenatal testing so that treatment can begin shortly after birth for those who have inherited both pathogenic variants.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
