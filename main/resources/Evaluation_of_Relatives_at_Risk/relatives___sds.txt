It is appropriate to evaluate as early as possible the older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify those who will benefit from treatment and preventive measures. This can also potentially prevent asymptomatic affected sibs from being used as bone marrow transplant donors.

If the SBDS pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing can be used to clarify the genetic status of at-risk sibs.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.

For pregnancies in women with SDS, high-risk pregnancy care including consultation with a hematologist is recommended [Alter et al 1999].
