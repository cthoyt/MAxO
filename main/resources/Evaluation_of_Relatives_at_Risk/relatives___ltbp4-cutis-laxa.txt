Pregnancy Management

Affected mother. To date pregnancy has been observed in one affected female with an unaffected fetus. The pregnancy was uneventful, but delivery was induced because of elevated maternal blood pressure. Delivery was vaginal with normal healing and no signs of prolapse. Two years after delivery both the mother and her son were doing well.

Despite evidence for the possibility of relatively normal pregnancy, a risk of aggravation of cardiopulmonary manifestations, and increased risk of both uterine rupture and exacerbation of pelvic floor/organ insufficiency including uterine, bladder, and rectal prolapse cannot be excluded based on this single case. Therefore, it is recommended that follow up of pregnancy and the postnatal period be done in a high-risk obstetric care unit with experience in connective tissue disorders.

Affected fetus

Major complications, such as preterm premature rupture of membranes, have not been reported during pregnancy with affected fetuses.

Polyhydramnios has been described in two instances in association with esophageal tortuosity or diverticulosis [Callewaert et al 2013].
