The genetic status of asymptomatic at-risk family members can be established using molecular genetic testing; however, the indications for family testing are unresolved. In the absence of evidence that early diagnosis of factor V Leiden reduces morbidity or mortality, decisions regarding testing should be made on an individual basis.

Clarification of factor V Leiden allele status may be useful in women considering hormonal contraception or pregnancy or in families with a strong history of recurrent venous thrombosis at a young age.

Asymptomatic factor V Leiden heterozygotes and homozygotes should be aware of the signs and symptoms of venous thromboembolism that require immediate medical attention and the potential need for prophylactic anticoagulation in high-risk circumstances. They should be informed that although a factor V allele is an established risk factor, it does not predict thrombosis with certainty because the clinical course is variable, even within the same family.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
