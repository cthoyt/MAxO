To date, all individuals with germline pathogenic CEBPA variants have presented with overt AML without any preceding blood count abnormalities or myelodysplasia, this in contrast with other familial leukemia syndromes such as those associated with germline RUNX1 or GATA2 pathogenic variants [Nickels et al 2013].

The decision to test for an inherited pathogenic variant is ultimately governed by personal choice, the reassurance of regular clinical follow up, and provision of genetic counseling. It is noteworthy that clinical monitoring may enable earlier diagnosis (and treatment) of AML, hence minimizing the risks associated with delayed presentation (e.g., severe anemia, neutropenic sepsis, and severe hemorrhage), providing further rationale for molecular evaluation of at-risk relatives. There are currently no preemptive treatments available for asymptomatic carriers of a germline CEBPA pathogenic variant.

See Genetic Counseling for issues related to testing of at-risk relatives for genetic counseling purposes.
